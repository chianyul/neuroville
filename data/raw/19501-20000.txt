J	Perry, JC				Perry, JC			A pilot study of defenses in adults with personality disorders entering psychotherapy	JOURNAL OF NERVOUS AND MENTAL DISEASE			English	Article							BORDERLINE PERSONALITY; THERAPEUTIC ALLIANCE; MECHANISMS; DEPRESSION	This study examined defensive functioning in adults entering open-ended dynamic psychotherapy and determined whether defenses predict retention at 1 year. Beginning at about the fifth session, 14 adults with personality and or depressive disorders entering open-ended dynamic psychotherapy had five therapy sessions audiotaped. The sessions were rated according to the Defense Mechanism Rating Scales, quantitative method. Interrater reliability of overall defensive functioning (ODF) and the number of defenses used per session were intraclass R = .85 and .83, respectively, whereas that of seven defense levels yielded a median of .625 (range .52 to .80). Stability of ODF across the five sessions was intraclass R = .48. The 11 subjects with personality disorders (PDs) used predominantly lower immature (49.3%) and neurotic (40.8%) level defenses. Subjects with borderline PD had significantly lower ODF than those with other PD types. Higher ODF was associated with remaining in treatment at 1 year, although this was confounded with a higher frequency of weekly sessions. Quantitative assessment of defenses demonstrated fair to excellent reliability and indicated that in the short term approximately half of defensive functioning reflects a stable repertoire, whereas the remaining variation may be due to occasion and error. PDs and especially BPD are characterized by a predominance of lower defenses. Higher defensive functioning was associated with twice-weekly sessions and retention in therapy at I year. hi therapy, adjusting technique to the patient's defenses may improve retention and outcome.

J	Berman, N; Dunn, RJ; Maler, L				Berman, N; Dunn, RJ; Maler, L			Function of NMDA receptors and persistent sodium channels in a feedback pathway of the electrosensory system	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article							LATERAL-LINE LOBE; WEAKLY ELECTRIC FISH; NEOCORTICAL PYRAMIDAL NEURONS; CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; AMINO-ACID RECEPTORS; APTERONOTUS-LEPTORHYNCHUS; COINCIDENCE DETECTION; SENSORY SEARCHLIGHT; HIPPOCAMPAL-NEURONS; GYMNOTIFORM FISH	Voltage-dependent amplification of ionotropic glutamatergic excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) can, in many vertebrate neurons, be due either to the intrinsic voltage dependence of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, or voltage-dependent persistent sodium channels expressed on postsynaptic dendrites or somata. In the electrosensory lateral line lobe (ELL) of the gymnotiform fish Apteronotus leptorhynchus, glutamatergic inputs onto pyramidal cell apical dendrites provide a system where both amplification mechanisms are possible. We have now examined the roles for both NMDA receptors and sodium channels in the control of EPSP amplitude at these synapses. An antibody specific for the A. leptorhynchus NR1 subunit reacted strongly with ELL pyramidal cells and were particularly abundant in the spines of pyramidal cell apical dendrites. We have also shown that NMDA receptors contributed strongly to the late phase of EPSPs; evoked by stimulation of the feedback fibers terminating on the apical dendritic spines; further, these EPSPs were voltage dependent. Blockade of NMDA receptors did not, however, eliminate the voltage dependence of these EPSPs. Blockade of somatic sodium channels by local somatic ejection of tetrodotoxin (TTX), or inclusion of QX314 (an intracellular sodium channel blocker) in the recording pipette, reduced the evoked EPSPs and completely eliminated their voltage dependence. We therefore conclude that, in the subthreshold range, persistent sodium currents are the main contributor to voltage-dependent boosting of EPSPs, even when they have a large NMDA receptor component.

TMS was applied over the left primary motor cortex (Ml) of healthy volunteers, intermixing single suprathreshold pulses with pairs of sub- and suprathreshold pulses and simultaneously recording EEG from 60 scalp electrodes. Averaging of EEG data time locked to the onset of TMS pulses yielded a waveform. consisting of a positive peak (30 ms after the pulse P30), followed by two negative peaks [at 45 (N45) and 100 ms]. Peak-to-peak amplitude of the P30-N45 waveform was high, ranging from 12 to 70 muV; in most subjects, the N45 potential could be identified in single EEG traces. Spectral analysis revealed that single-pulse TMS induced a brief period of synchronized activity in the beta range (15-30 Hz) in the vicinity of the stimulation site; again, this oscillatory response was apparent not only in the EEG averages but also in single traces. Both the N45 and the oscillatory response were lower in amplitude in the 12-ms (but not 3-ms) paired-pulse trials, compared with the single-pulse trials. These findings are consistent with the possibility that TMS applied to MI induces transient synchronization of spontaneous activity of cortical neurons within the 15- to 30-Hz frequency range. As such, they corroborate previous studies of cortical oscillations in the motor cortex and point to the potential of the combined TMS/EEG approach for further investigations of cortical rhythms in the human brain.

J	Cabel, DW; Cisek, P; Scott, SH				Cabel, DW; Cisek, P; Scott, SH			Neural activity in primary motor cortex related to mechanical loads applied to the shoulder and elbow during a postural task	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article							DIFFERENT ARM ORIENTATIONS; SIMILAR HAND PATHS; REACHING MOVEMENTS; INDIVIDUAL CELLS; ACTIVATION; DIRECTION; MUSCLES; COORDINATION; DISCHARGE; TORQUES	Whole-arm motor tasks performed by nonhuman primates have become a popular paradigm to examine neural activity during motor action, but such studies have traditionally related cell discharge to hand-based variables. We have developed a new robotic device that allows the mechanics of the shoulder and elbow joints to be manipulated independently. This device was used in the present study to examine neural activity in primary motor cortex (Ml) in monkeys (macaca mulatta) actively maintaining their hand at a central target as they compensated for loads applied to the shoulder and/or elbow. Roughly equal numbers of neurons were sensitive to mechanical loads only at the shoulder, only at the elbow, or loads at both joints. Neurons possessed two important properties. First, cell activity during multi-joint loads could be predicted from its activity during single-joint loads as a vector sum in a space defined by orthogonal axes for the shoulder and elbow. Second, most neurons were related to flexor torque at one joint coupled with extensor torque at the other, a distribution that paralleled the observed activity of forelimb muscles. These results illustrate that while MI activity may be described by independent axes representing each mechanical degree-of-freedom, neural activity is also strongly influenced by the specific motor patterns used to perform a given task.

In the present study, we examined the effect of morphine on the in vitro and in vivo density and trafficking of delta opioid receptors (delta ORs). Prolonged exposure (48 hr) of cortical neurons in culture to morphine (10 gm) resulted in a robust increase in the internalization of Fluo-deltorphin, a highly selective fluorescent SOR agonist. This effect was mu -mediated because it was entirely blocked by the selective mu opioid receptor antagonist D-Phe-Cys-Tyr-D-Trp-Orn-Thr-Pen-Thr-NH2 and was reproduced using the selective mu agonist fentanyl citrate. Immunogold electron microscopy revealed a marked increase in the cell surface density of delta ORs in neurons exposed to morphine, indicating that the increase in Fluo-deltorphin internalization was caused by increased receptor availability. Prolonged morphine exposure had no effect on delta OR protein levels, as assessed by immunocytochemistry and Western blotting, suggesting that the increase in bioavailable delta ORs was caused by recruitment of reserve receptors from intracellular stores and not from receptor neosynthesis. Complementary in vivo studies demonstrated that chronic treatment of adult rats with morphine (5-15 mg/kg, s.c., every 12 hr) similarly augmented targeting of delta ORs to neuronal plasma membranes in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. Furthermore, this treatment markedly potentiated intrathecal D-[Ala(2)]deltorphin II-induced antinociception. Taken together, these results demonstrate that prolonged stimulation of neurons with morphine markedly increases recruitment of intracellular delta ORs to the cell surface, both in vitro and in vivo. We propose that this type of receptor subtype cross-mobilization may widen the transduction repertoire of G-protein-coupled receptors and offer new therapeutic strategies.

Previous brain imaging studies have focused on identifying activity related to the set-shifting requirement of the WCST The present study used event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to study the pattern of activation during four distinct stages in the performance of this task. Eleven subjects were scanned while performing the WCST and a control task involving matching two identical cards. The results demonstrated specific involvement of different prefrontal areas during different stages of task performance. The mid-dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (area 9/46) increased activity while subjects received either positive or negative feedback, that is at the point when the current information must be related to earlier events stored in working memory. This is consistent with the proposed role of the mid-dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in the monitoring of events in working memory. By contrast, a cortical basal ganglia loop involving the mid-ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (area 47/12), caudate nucleus, and mediodorsal thalamus increased activity specifically during the reception of negative feedback, which signals the need for a mental shift to a new response set. The posterior prefrontal cortex response was less specific; increases in activity occurred during both the reception of feedback and the response period, indicating a role in the association of specific actions to stimuli. The putamen exhibited increased activity while matching after negative feedback but not while matching after positive feedback, implying greater involvement during novel than routine actions.

MYXOZOA; ALGONQUIAN PARK; CENTRAL FINLAND; 2 LAKES; MYXOSPOREA; ONTARIO; FISH; GILLS; INFECTIONS	Late summer myxozoan infra- and component communities parasitizing 73 Notropis hudsonius at 5 sites on the St. Lawrence River upstream and downstream from the island of Montreal are described from study of histological sections of individual fish. Community membership included Myxobolus sp. A (intracellular in striated muscle fibers), Myxobolus sp. B (intracellular in striated muscle fibers), Myxobolus sp. C (brain), and Thelohanellus notatus (Mavor, 1916) Kudo, 1929 (loose connective tissue), all of which are histozoic myxobolids displaying strict tissue specificity for trophozoite development. Mean infracommunity richness in fish at the separate localities was estimated to be 0.4 +/- 0.5 to 1.3 +/- 0.7, with a maximum richness of 3 in any 1 fish. Component community richness in host samples was 2 to 4. It is argued that these are relatively high levels of diversity for freshwater fish parasites but that the values are probably conservative because of the study of only portions of individual fish. The percentage of fish infected with myxozoans of any species and infracommunity richness was significantly greater below the island of Montreal compared with above it. It is suspected that increased oligochaete populations at these sites, resulting from sewage-caused organic enrichment of sediments, may have accounted for the observed increased prevalence of infection.

P-glycoprotein (P-gp), a membrane-associated ATP-dependent efflux transporter, limits entry into the brain of numerous xenobiotics, including anti-HIV drugs (i.e., protease inhibitors). This project investigates the functional expression of P-gp in the endogenous immune cells of the brain, a parenchymal compartment not previously studied. We used a cell line (MLS-9) derived from rat microglia to study the transport of digoxin, a known P-gp substrate. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis detected mRNA for only mdr1b in IMLS-9 cells, whereas both mdr1a and mdr1b mRNA were expressed in primary cultured microglia from which they were derived. Western blot analysis with the C219 antibody detected a single band at similar to 170 to 180 kDa in MLS-9 cells, which is the size previously reported for P-gp. Immunocytochemical analysis with the monoclonal antibodies C219, MRK16, and MAB-448 labeled P-gp protein along the plasma membrane and nuclear envelope of MLS-9 cells. [H-3]Digoxin accumulation by monolayers of MLS-9 cells was significantly enhanced in the presence of any of several P-gp inhibitors (verapamil, cyclosporin A, quinidine, PSC 833), protease inhibitors (i.e., saquinavir, indinavir, and ritonavir), and sodium azide, an ATPase inhibitor. These results provide the first evidence for the functional expression of P-gp in microglia and imply that entry of pharmacological agents, including protease inhibitors, may be prevented within the brain parenchyma, as well as at the blood-brain barrier.

The ANN method was adapted to three distinct data bases covering the northern North Atlantic (N = 371), plus the Arctic seas (N = 540) and the Bering Sea (N = 646). The relative abundance of 23 dinocyst taxa was calibrated against hydrographic variables (sea-surface temperature, salinity and density in February and August, and seasonal extent of sea-ice cover) using ANNs. The estimation of hydrographical parameters based on an ANN yields high coefficients of correlation between observations and reconstructions for each variable selected. The validation tests performed on the different data bases suggest more accurate calibration at the scale of the North Atlantic and Arctic (N = 540) than on a multibasin scale, i.e. when including the subpolar North Pacific (N = 646). The ANN calibrations and the modern analogue technique (MAT) have been applied to two sequences from the northwest North Atlantic spanning the past 25 000 yr for the purpose of comparison. Both approaches yielded similar results, generally within the range of their respective uncertainties, demonstrating their suitability. The main discrepancies generally correspond to assemblages with poor modern analogues for which we have to admit a higher degree of uncertainties in the reconstruction, whatever the approach used.

Although this has traditionally been considered only in terms of a neural-based interaction, it has recently been suggested that the information content in the stimulus may account for the interaction. Here we ask the question, "Do similar interference effects occur for the discrimination of low-contrast letters whose size is larger than that corresponding to the resolution limit?" If so, previous acuity-based interaction results may be of more general importance. We show that while there are interference effects of nearby contours, they are of a form different from that observed at the resolution limit. In particular, the contrast polarity of the nearby contour is unimportant, which in turn suggests that a physical explanation is inappropriate. Also, the discrimination of an easily resolvable, unflanked Landolt C target requires information over a much wider spatial-frequency range than its counterpart at the resolution limit.

In addition to the Eps15 homology (EH) and Src homology 3 (SH3) domains of intersectin-s, the neuronal variant (intersectin-I) also has Dbl homology (DH), pleckstrin homology (PH) and C2 domains(1,3-7). We now show that intersectin-I functions through its DH domain as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for Cdc42. In cultured cells, expression of DH-domain-containing constructs cause actin rearrangements specific for Cdc42 activation. Moreover, in vivo studies reveal that stimulation of Cdc42 by intersectin-I accelerates actin assembly via N-WASP and the Arp2/3 complex. N-WASP binds directly to intersectin-I and upregulates its GEF activity, thereby generating GTP-bound Cdc42, a critical activator of N-WASP. These studies reveal a role for intersectin-I in a novel mechanism of N-WASP activation and in regulation of the actin cytoskeleton.

Here we report the identification of two independent deletion mutations linked to ALS2 in the coding exons of the new gene ALS2. These deletion mutations result in frameshifts that generate premature stop codons. ALS2 is expressed in various tissues and cells, including neurons throughout the brain and spinal cord, and encodes a protein containing multiple domains that have homology to RanGEF as well as RhoGEF. Deletion mutations are predicted to cause a loss of protein function, providing strong evidence that ALS2 is the causative gene underlying this form of ALS.

ASIC subunits can assemble in homomeric and heteromeric channels with specific biophysical and pharmacological properties. Using heterologous expression of ASIC subunits in Xenopus oocytes, we show here that the biphasic response of heteromeric rat and human ASIC2A+3 subtypes to low pH is selectively modulated by the neuropeptide FF (NPFF) and by the related peptide FMRFamide. We recorded both a dramatic potentiation (up to 275%) of the amplitude of acid-gated human ASIC2A+3 maximal currents and a change of desensitization kinetics in the presence of NPFF (EC50=2 muM) leading to a slowly inactivating phenotype. These modulatory effects were not observed with the corresponding homomeric human ASIC2A or ASIC3 receptor subtypes. Moreover, the sensitivity of ASIC2A+3 receptors to extracellular protons was increased in the presence of NPFF (Delta pH(50)=+0.5). Our data therefore suggest that the direct sensitization of heteromeric proton-gated channels by endogenous neuropeptides might play a role in the neuronal response to noxious acidosis in sensory and central pathways.

Noxious stimulus-induced PKC translocation likely depends on glutamate activity at either N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors or group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR1/5) in the spinal cord dorsal horn. This study compares nociceptive responses to, and the alterations in membrane-associated PKC, induced by noxious chemical stimulation of the hindpaw and CCI of the sciatic nerve, as well as their modulation by both NMDA and mGluR1/5 receptor antagonists. Three groups of rats were given a single intrathecal (i.t.) injection of either vehicle, dizocilpine maleate (MK-801, 60 nmol), an NMDA receptor antagonist, or (S)-4-carboxyphenylglycine (S)-4CPG, (150 nmol), an mGluR1/5 antagonist, 10 min prior to a 50 mul of 2.5% formalin injection into the ventral surface of one hind paw. Another three groups of rats were given twice daily injections of either vehicle, MK-801 (30 nmol) or (S)-4CPG (90 nmol) i.t. for 5 days starting 30 min before CCI or sham injury of the sciatic nerve. Nociceptive responses were assessed for a 60 min period after the formalin injection in the first three groups, and tests of mechanical and cold allodynia were performed on days 4, 8, 12 and 16 after CCI for the latter three groups. Furthermore, changes in the levels of membraneassociated PKC, as assayed by quantitative autoradiography of the specific binding of [H-3]-phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate ([H-3]-PDBu) in the dorsal horn of the lumbar spinal cord sections, were assessed in formalin-injected rats (at 5, 25 and 60 min) and in neuropathic rats 5 days after CCI, treated (as above) with vehicle, MK-801 or (S)-4CPG. The results indicate that i.t. treatment with MK-801 significantly reduced nociceptive scores in the formalin test and also produced a significant suppression of formalin-induced increases in [H-3]-PDBu binding in laminae I-II, III-VI and X of the lumbar spinal cord. In contrast, i.t. treatment with (S)-4CPG failed to significantly affect either nociceptive behaviours in the formalin test or formalin-Induced increases in [3H]-PDBu binding in laminae I-II and III-VI of the lumbar spinal cord. On the other hand, Lt. treatment with either MK-801 or (S)-4CPG produced a significant reduction in mechanical and cold hypersensitivity, as well as [H-3]-PDBu binding in laminae I-II and III-VI of the lumbar spinal cord, after CCL These results suggest that while NMDA, but not mGluR1/5, receptors are involved in translocation of PKC and nociception in a model of persistent acute pain, both types of receptors influence the translocation of PKC in dorsal horn and mechanical and cold allodynia in a model of chronic neuropathic pain.

J	Glavinovic, MI; Rabie, HR				Glavinovic, MI; Rabie, HR			Monte Carlo evaluation of quantal analysis in the light of Ca2+ dynamics and the geometry of secretion	PFLUGERS ARCHIV-EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Monte Carlo simulation; calcium dynamics; quantal analysis; quantal size; vesicular secretion	BOVINE CHROMAFFIN CELLS; FROG NEUROMUSCULAR-JUNCTION; SYNAPTIC TRANSMITTER RELEASE; PRESYNAPTIC CALCIUM DYNAMICS; INTRACELLULAR CALCIUM; BUFFERING PROPERTIES; HIPPOCAMPAL SYNAPSE; BINDING-PROTEINS; PLASMA-MEMBRANE; DEVELOPING RATS	Using the Monte Carlo technique, Ca2+ dynamics were simulated in the absence and presence of vesicles to gain better insight into what governs quantal release. A vesicle, represented as a flat, infinitely thin surface, was positioned parallel to the plasma membrane at a chosen distance from the locus of Ca2+ entry. Because vesicles act as important diffusion barriers after the synchronous opening of Ca2+ channels (as occurs during evoked release), [Ca2+] close to the plasma membrane reaches higher levels than it would in the absence of vesicles. The rise in [Ca2+] is greater under larger vesicles close to the plasma membrane, which thus have a higher probability of release. The power-law relationship between the [Ca2+] and the probability of release, and the cubic relationship between the vesicular diameter and its volume can make this relationship very steep. In contrast, when release occurs owing to fluctuations of [Ca2+] - as a result of Ca2+ release from an internal store or asynchronous opening of Ca2+ channels (during spontaneous release) - the effect of vesicles as diffusion barriers is less pronounced and vesicles of different sizes should have a similar probability of release. Since the preferential release of large vesicles depends on how the Ca2+ needed for secretion is raised (synchronously versus asynchronously), the quantal size of evoked and spontaneous release should differ. The main factors influencing the preferential release of large vesicles are the distance between vesicles and the plasma membrane, the concentration of Ca2+ buffers, and single-channel Ca2+ flux. Vesicles also have a pronounced effect on Ca2+ binding to buffers and on the spatio-temporal distribution of bound buffers. The greater the vesicular size and the closer their position to the plasma membrane, the more fixed buffers will be bound near the plasma membrane because of limited diffusion of Ca2+. Since bound fixed buffers act as "memory elements", such a change in their spatial distribution will further enhance the probability of release of large vesicles during stimulation.

Integrated visualization of medical images aims to assist the clinician in this task by efficiently presenting information from different sources, usually combining functional with anatomical data. The present paper describes the research we performed over the past decade in the area of integrated visualization of functional and anatomical brain images. A brief survey of integrated 2-D and 3-D medical image display techniques is presented. Special attention is paid to Normal Fusion, a surface mapping 3-D visualization technique combined with hue-saturation-value color encoding that has typically been applied for functio-anatomical brain visualization. The key issue for clinical acceptance of novel visualization techniques is whether they can improve diagnosis and/or facilitate the information transfer to the referring specialist. To investigate these issues, several evaluation studies have been performed over recent years. Extensive evaluation of SPECT/MRI brain images showed that integrated visualization provides an increased performance of localizing physiological abnormalities, while enhancing the confidence of the observers in their localizations. Studies in a clinical setting showed that integrated visualization improves the pre-surgical evaluation of patients with epilepsy and may be of considerable assistance in the understanding and interpretation of complicated processes as, e.g., seizure related cortical blood flow changes, which require a highly efficient presentation of enormous amounts of multimodal image data. We conclude that methods for integrated visualization of functional and anatomical brain images can be powerful tools to assist the clinician in the retrieval of relevant information from multimodal medical image data.

Objectives: The aim of the present work was to investigate the effects of the alpha (2)-agonist clonidine on ventral tegmental area dopamine neurons during morphine withdrawal syndrome by recording their neuronal activity before and after the administration of low and relatively high doses of clonidine (from 5 to 100 mug/kg). Methods: The spontaneous neuronal activity of mesoaccumbens dopaminergic neurons, identified by anti-dromical stimulation from the nucleus accumbens, was recorded by use of in vivo extracellular single-unit recordings in control and morphine-withdrawn rats after chronic administration (15 days). Results: Control rats showed a mean spontaneous firing frequency of 2.47 +/- 0.48 Hz, percentage of burst firing of 22 +/- 12 and an increase in firing after the administration of cumulative doses of clonidine (5, 10, 20, 40, 100 mug/kg). Conversely, both spontaneous firing rate (1.55 +/- 0.25 Hz) and the percentage of burst firing (5 +/- 2) were found to be significantly reduced in rats abstinent for 24 h, and increasing doses of clonidine did not re-establish electrophysiological activity observed in the controls. Conclusion: The results indicate that: 1) clonidine did not restore the decreased firing activity of DA neurons in morphine-withdrawn rats, and 2) high doses of clonidine increased firing in control rats but not in morphine-withdrawn rats.

However, the relationship between these models and clinical anxiety symptoms and syndromes is unclear. The National Institute of Mental Health convened a workshop to discuss the relationship between existing behavioral models of anxiety and the clinical profile of anxiety disorders. A second goal of this workshop was to outline various approaches towards modeling components of anxiety disorders. Objectives: To briefly describe epidemiological and behavioral manifestations of clinical anxiety syndromes and how they relate to commonly employed animal models of anxiety. To describe approaches and considerations for developing, improving, and adapting anxiety models to better understand the neurobiology of anxiety. Methods: Clinicians, psychiatrists and clinical and basic neuroscientists presented data exemplifying different approaches towards understanding anxiety and the role of animal models. Panel members outlined what they considered to be critical issues in developing and employing animal models of anxiety. Results: This review summarizes the discussions and conclusions of the workshop including recommendations for improving upon existing models and strategies for developing novel models. Conclusions: The probability of developing comprehensive animal models that accurately reflect the relative influences of factors contributing to anxiety disorder syndromes is quite low. However, ample opportunity remains to better define and extend existing models and behavioral measures related to specific processes that may be disrupted in anxiety disorders and to develop new models that consider the impact of combined factors in determining anxious behaviors.

We assessed the associations between exposure to neurotoxic substances in the workplace, workers'mental health, and workers'relationships with their social network. Methods: A sample of 53 workers and their spouse completed a series of questionnaires, an interview on work history, and a structured interview assessing their personal relationships. Exposure to neurotoxic substances in the workplace were assessed by an interview, using a semiquantitative classification system. Mental health was measured with the Profile of Mood States (POMS), and marital satisfaction with the Marital Adjustment Test (MAT). The social network's characteristics were assessed with the Northern California Community Study Interview Schedule (NCCS). The associations between exposure and social networks were assessed with regression analyses. Results: There were no associations between exposure and marital satisfaction. However, we found a negative association between workers'exposure and degrees of overlap between husbands' and wives' social networks (Pearson's correlation r=-0.27; p<0.05) and a positive association between exposure and workers' dependency on their support network (r=0.46; p<0.01). Conclusion: The results are discussed in terms of variables potentially linking exposure to social relationships as well as in terms of couples' vulnerability to marital distress among exposed workers.

Since ET-1 is primarily transcriptionally regulated, there should be a corresponding increase in pre-pro-endothelin-1 (ppET-1). Our objective was to determine whether ppET-1 is increased in pigs with a low systemic vascular resistance. We also examined the distribution of ET-1 and the regulation of endothelin-converting enzyme 1 (ECE-1), the rate limiting enzyme in ET-1 production. We anesthetized and ventilated 16 pigs. We measured arterial, pulmonary, and central venous pressures, as well as cardiac output. ET-1 was measured by radioimmunoassay in plasma and in multiple tissues. We infused 20 mug/kg of endotoxin over 2 h and then sacrificed the animals. ppET-1 and ECE-1 mRNA were assessed by Northern analysis. We performed immunohistochemistry for the assessment of tissue ET-1 and ECE-1. The systemic vascular resistance rose at 30 min, but fell by 120 min. Plasma ET-1 more than doubled by 2 h. However, there was no change in the concentration of ET-1 in any tissue except in the pulmonary artery. By immunohistochemistry, there was also no change in ET-1 in aorta, vena cava, heart, lung, liver, and kidney. Distribution of ECE-1 followed that of ET-1 on immunohistochemistry. There was a significant increase in ppET-1 mRNA in liver, kidney papillae, and vena cava, and a tendency for an increase in other tissues. This was paralleled by an increase in ECE-1 mRNA. In conclusion, the amount of ECE-1 mRNA and protein parallel those of ET-1. Endotoxemia is associated with a marked increase in plasma ET-1 and an increase in ppET-1 and ECE-1 mRNA in multiple tissues; however, there was no significant change in tissue ET-1 except in the pulmonary artery. The rise in plasma levels without a change in tissue levels suggests a greater release into the vasculature in sepsis than under normal conditions.

Animal and human studies suggest that chronic administration of addictive drugs may lead to impaired dopamine neurotransmission in the nucleus accumbens. We measured DI receptor density in 11 smokers and 18 nonsmokers using positron emission tomography and the D1 receptor ligand [C-11]SCH 23390. Ten of the smokers were scanned twice, once after overnight abstinence from cigarettes, and once while smoking at their usual rate, to account for possible acute effects of cigarette smoking on D1 receptor binding. In addition, eight control subjects were scanned twice to assess the reproducibility of the method. We used compartmental modeling to measure [C-11]SCH 23390 binding potential, a measure of D1 receptor density. There were no differences in binding between abstinent and nonabstinent scans in smokers or in the two scans in controls. However, there was a significant reduction in [C-11]SCH 23390 binding potential in smokers compared to nonsmokers in the striatum, most prominently in the ventral striatum. This suggests that there is a reduction in dopamine D1 receptor density in the ventral striatum of human cigarette smokers relative to nonsmokers, which implies that the postsynaptic mesolimbic dopamine system may be chronically underactive in smokers, either as an antecedent or consequence of addiction to cigarettes. Such a hypodopaminergic state may play an important role in sustaining nicotine-seeking behavior. Alternatively, an inherited reduction in dopamine receptors in the striatum may be associated with an increased risk of addictive behavior. Synapse 42:48-53, 2001. (C) 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

The relative importance of chemical and electrical synapses for synchronization of electrical activity during development is unclear. We examined the activity patterns of identified spinal neurons at the onset of motor activity in zebrafish embryos. Rhythmic activity appeared early and persisted upon blocking chemical neurotransmission but was abolished by inhibitors of gap junctions. Paired recordings revealed that active spinal neurons were electrically coupled and formed a simple network of motoneurons and a subset of interneurons. Thus, the earliest spinal central pattern generator consists of synchronously active, electrically coupled neurons.

Cerebral blood flow changes were measured in response to subject-selected music that elicited the highly pleasurable experience of "shivers-down-the-spine" or "chills." Subjective reports of chills were accompanied by changes in heart rate, electromyogram, and respiration. As intensity of these chills increased, cerebral blood flow increases and decreases were observed in brain regions thought to be involved in reward/motivation, emotion, and arousal, including ventral striatum, midbrain, amygdala, orbitofrontal cortex, and ventral medial prefrontal cortex. These brain structures are known to be active in response to other euphoria-inducing stimuli, such as food, sex, and drugs of abuse. This finding links music with biologically relevant, survival-related stimuli via their common recruitment of brain circuitry involved in pleasure and reward.

We have analyzed the biochemical and functional roles of HES6 in myoblasts. HES6 interacted with the corepressor transducin-like Enhancer of split 1 in yeast and mammalian cells through its WRPW COOH-terminal motif. HES6 repressed transcription from an N box-containing template and also when tethered to DNA through the GAL4 DNA binding domain. On N box-containing promoters, HES6 cooperated with HES1 to achieve maximal repression. An HES6-VP16 activation domain fusion protein activated the N box-containing reporter, confirming that HES6 bound the N box in muscle cells. The expression of HES6 was induced when myoblasts fused to become differentiated myotubes. Constitutive expression of HES6 in myoblasts. inhibited expression of MyoR, a repressor of myogenesis, and induced differentiation, as evidenced by fusion into myotubes and expression of the muscle marker myosin heavy chain. Reciprocally, blocking endogenous HES6 function by using a WRPW-deleted dominant negative HES6 mutant led to increased expression of MyoR and completely blocked the muscle development program. Our results show that HES6 is an important regulator of myogenesis and suggest that MyoR is a target for HES6-dependent transcriptional repression.

However, the navigational ability of adult CNS axons and the guidance cues they can recognize are still essentially unknown. Astrocytes may express guidance molecules and are known to have different regional phenotypes. To evaluate their influence on the affinity of adult serotoninergic (5-HT) axons for a projection target, we co-implanted astrocytes from the neonatal striatum, cortex, or ventral mesencephalon together with fetal ventral mesencephalic, tissue into the striatum of adult rats. Two months after surgery; quantification after in vitro 5-[1,2-H-3]serotonin ([H-3]5-HT) uptake and autoradiography showed that ventral mesencephalic grafts with co-grafted cortical or striatal astrocytes were four times and three times, respectively, more densely innervated by host 5-HT axons than control ventral mesencephalic, grafts with or without co-grafted ventral mesencephalic astrocytes. Immunohistochemistry for glial fibrillary acidic protein, vimentin, or chondroitin-sulfate proteoglycans revealed no qualitative or quantitative differences in host astroglial scar or production of inhibitory molecules that could explain these differences in 5-HT innervation. These results demonstrate that astrocytes grown in culture from different brain regions have the potential to influence the growth and maintenance of adult 5-HT axons in a graft of neural tissue from another brain region. It should now be feasible to identify the molecules expressed by cultured cortical or striatal, but not by ventral mesencephalic, astrocytes that have these tropic actions on 5-HT axons of the neostriatum.

The previously well known A alpha beta -fiber terminals are closely intertwined with endings from peptidergic C-fibers. These intertwined endings are segregated into zones that alternate with zones containing a third type of ending supplied by nonpeptidergic C-fibers. Although MCs are widely regarded as low-threshold mechanoreceptors, all three types of innervation express immunochemical properties associated with nociception. The peptidergic C-fiber endings have readily detectable levels of immunoreactivity (IR) for calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and substance P (SP). The A alpha beta endings have relatively lower levels of IR for CGRP and SP as well as the SP neurokinin 1 receptor and vanilloid-like receptor 1. Both the A alpha beta and peptidergic C-fiber endings were also labeled with antibodies for different combinations of adrenergic, opioid, and purinergic receptors. The nonpeptidergic C-fiber endings express IR for vanilloid receptor 1, which has also been implicated in nociception. Thus, MCs are multiafferented receptor organs that may have nociceptive capabilities in addition to being low-threshold mechanoreceptors.

To address this issue, brain activation was measured in normal male subjects while they either responded in a normal manner to erotic film excerpts or voluntarily attempted to inhibit the sexual arousal induced by viewing erotic stimuli. Results demonstrated that the sexual arousal experienced, in response to the erotic film excerpts, was associated with activation in "limbic" and paralimbic structures, such as the right amygdala, right anterior temporal pole, and hypothalamus. In addition, the attempted inhibition of the sexual arousal generated by viewing the erotic stimuli was associated with activation of the right superior frontal gyrus and right anterior cingulate gyrus. No activation was found in limbic areas. These findings reinforce the view that emotional self-regulation is normally implemented by a neural circuit comprising various prefrontal regions and subcortical limbic structures. They also suggest that humans have the capacity to influence the electrochemical dynamics of their brains, by voluntarily changing the nature of the mind processes unfolding in the psychological space.

These results indicate that a positively charged N-terminal amino group may be essential for signal transduction but not for receptor binding and suggested that its deletion in agonist opioid peptides containing an N-terminal 2 ' ,6 ' -dimethyltyrosine (Dmt) residue may represent a general way to convert them into antagonists. In an attempt to develop dynorphin A (Dyn A)-derived kappa opioid antagonists, we prepared analogues of [Dmt(1)] Dyn A(1 - 11)-NH2 (1), in which the N-terminal amino group was either omitted or replaced with a methyl group. This was achieved by replacement of Tyr(1) with 3-(2,6-dimethyl-4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid (Dhp) or (2S)-2-methyl-3-(2,6-dimethyl-4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid [(2S)-Mdp]. Compounds were tested in the guinea pig ileum and mouse vas deferens bioassays and in rat and guinea pig brain membrane receptor binding assays. All analogues turned out to be potent kappa antagonists against Dyn A(1 - 13) and the nonpeptide agonist U50,488 and showed only weak mu and delta antagonist activity. The most potent and most selective kappa antagonist of the series was [(2S)-Mdp(1)]Dyn A(1 - 13)-NH2 (5, dynantin), which showed subnanomolar kappa antagonist potency against Dyn A(1-13) and very high kappa selectivity both in terms of its K-e values determined against kappa, mu, and delta agonists and in terms of its ratios of kappa, mu, and delta receptor binding affinity constants. Dynantin is the first potent and selective Dyn A-derived kappa antagonist known and may complement the non-peptide kappa antagonists norbinaltorphimine and GNTI as a pharmacological tool in opioid research.

Of the several growth-related genes in this chromosomal region, only GRB10 has been demonstrated to be imprinted; however, imprinting was limited to brain and muscle and was incomplete. Using reverse-transcript PCR, we now confirm GRB10 imprinting in these two tissues is isoform-specific and, more importantly, demonstrate absence of imprinting in growth plate cartilage, the tissue most directly involved in linear growth.

J	Gingras, J; Ferns, M				Gingras, J; Ferns, M			Expression and localization of agrin during sympathetic synapse formation in vitro	JOURNAL OF NEUROBIOLOGY			English	Article						superior cervical ganglia; synaptogenesis; neuronal acetylcholine receptors; alpha-dystroglycan	SUPERIOR CERVICAL-GANGLION; ADULT-RAT BRAIN; ACETYLCHOLINE-RECEPTORS; HIPPOCAMPAL-NEURONS; CORTICAL-NEURONS; NICOTINIC RECEPTORS; DEFICIENT MICE; MESSENGER-RNA; AVIAN RETINA; ISOFORMS	Agrin is a motoneuron-derived signaling factor that plays a key organizing role in the initial stages of neuromuscular synapse formation. Agrin is expressed in other regions of the developing central and peripheral nervous systems, however, raising the possibility that it also directs the formation of some interneuronal synapses. To address this question, we have examined the expression and localization of agrin during formation of cholinergic, interneuronal synapses in the sympathetic system. In the superior cervical ganglia (SCG) in vivo, we found that agrin is highly expressed, and that it is present at, but is not limited to, synapses. In SCG neuronal cultures that were treated with ciliary neurotrophic factor to induce a uniform cholinergic phenotype, we found that agrin immunostaining colocalized precisely with cholinergic terminals and aggregates of neuronal acetylcholine receptor on the neuronal cell bodies and dendrites. Moreover, we found that alpha -dystroglycan, which is a potential receptor for agrin, is also concentrated at these cholinergic synaptic contacts. Finally, the SCG neurons expressed the C-terminal isoform of agrin that is neural-specific and highly active in synaptogenesis, and also the N-terminal splice isoform that occurs as a type II transmembrane protein. These findings show that agrin is specifically localized at sympathetic synapses in vitro, and are consistent with it playing a role in interneuronal synapse formation.

In order to test whether B. thuringiensis-activated toxins elicit a toxic response in the hemocoel, we measured the effect of intrahemocoelic injections of several Cry1 toxins on the food intake, growth, and survival of Lymantria dispar (Lepidoptera) and Neobellieria bullata (Diptera) larvae. Injection of Cry1C was highly toxic to the Lymantria larvae and resulted in the complete inhibition of food intake, growth arrest, and death in a dose-dependent manner. Cry1Aa and Cry1Ab (5 mug/0.2 g [fresh weight] [g fresh wt]) also affected growth and food intake but were less toxic than Cry1C (0.5 mug/0.2 g fresh wt). Cry1E and Cry1Ac (5 mug/0.2 g fresh wt) had no toxic effect upon injection. Cry1C was also highly toxic to N. bullata larvae upon injection. Injection of 5 mug/0.2 g fresh wt resulted in rapid paralysis, followed by hemocytic melanization and death. Lower concentrations delayed pupariation or gave rise to malformation of the puparium. Finally, Cry1C was toxic to brain cells of Lymantria in vitro. The addition of Cry1C (20 mug/ml) to primary cultures of Lymantria brain cells resulted in rapid lysis of the cultured neurons.

However, findings also link childhood abuse to anomalous 5-HT and cortisol function, and this motivated us to explore relationships between childhood abuse and neurobiological variations in BN. Methods: Thirty-five bulimic and 25 nonbulimic women were assessed for childhood physical and sexual abuse, eating symptoms, and comorbid psychopathological tendencies. These women provided blood samples for measurement of platelet hydrogen-3-paroxetine binding and serial prolactin and cortisol responses following oral administration of the partial 5-HT agonist metachlorophenylpiperazine (m-CPP). Results: Bulimic women showed markedly lower mean SD density (B-max) of paroxetine-binding sites (631.12 +/- 341.58) than did normal eaters (1213.00 +/- 628.74) (t(54) = -4.47; P = .001). Paroxetine binding did not vary with childhood abuse. In contrast, measures of peak change on prolactin levels after m-CPP administration (Delta -peak prolactin) indicated blunted response in abused bulimic women (7.26 +/- 7.06), nonabused bulimic women (5.62 +/- 3.95), and abused women who were normal eaters (5.73 +/- 5.19) compared with nonabused women who were normal eaters (13.57 +/- 9.94) (F-3,F-51 = 3.04, P = .04). Furthermore, individuals reporting childhood abuse showed decreased plasma cortisol levels relative to nonabused women who were normal eaters. Conclusion: Findings imply that BN and childhood abuse are both generally associated with reduced 5-HT tone but that childhood abuse may be somewhat more specifically linked to reduced cortisol levels (ie, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis) activity.

Thus, the sensory stimulus and act (eating) were held constant while the reward value of the chocolate and motivation of the subject to eat were manipulated by feeding. Non-specific effects of satiety (such as feelings of fullness and autonomic changes) were also present and probably contributed to the modulation of brain activity. After eating each piece of chocolate, subjects gave ratings of how pleasant/ unpleasant the chocolate was and of how much they did or did not want another piece of chocolate. Regional cerebral blood flow was then regressed against subjects' ratings. Different groups of structures were recruited selectively depending on whether subjects were eating chocolate when they were highly motivated to eat and rated the chocolate as very pleasant [subcallosal region, caudomedial orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), insula/operculum, striatum and midbrain] or whether they ate chocolate despite being satiated (parahippocampal gyrus, caudolateral OFC and prefrontal regions). As predicted, modulation was observed in cortical chemosensory areas, including the insula and caudomedial and caudolateral OFC, suggesting that the reward value of food is represented here. Of particular interest, the medial and lateral caudal OFC showed opposite patterns of activity. This pattern of activity indicates that there may be a functional segregation of the neural representation of reward and punishment within this region. The only brain region that was active during both positive and negative compared with neutral conditions was the posterior cingulate cortex. Therefore, these results support the hypothesis that there are two separate motivational systems: one orchestrating approach and another avoidance behaviours.

Here, we report results obtained with a voxel-wise statistical analysis of hemispheric asymmetries in regional 'amounts' of gray matter, based on MRI scans obtained in 142 healthy young adults. Firstly, the voxel-wise analysis detected the well-known frontal (right > left) and occipital (left > right) petalias. Secondly, our analysis confirmed the presence of left-greater-than-right asymmetries in several posterior language areas, including the planum temporale and the angular gyrus; no significant asymmetry was detected in the anterior language regions. We also found previously described asymmetries in the cingulate sulcus (right > left) and the caudate nucleus (right > left). Finally, in some brain regions we observed highly significant asymmetries that were not reported before, such as in the anterior insular cortex (right > left). The above asymmetries were observed in men and women. Our results thus provide confirmation of the known structural asymmetries in the human brain as well as new findings that may stimulate further research of hemispheric specialization.

The present investigation gathered preliminary data on how focal brain lesions influence one important aspect of prosody that has been largely ignored in the literature-the production of sentence-level syntactic distinctions that rely on prosodic alterations to disambiguate alternate meanings of a sentence. Utterances characterizing three distinct types of syntactic ambiguities (scope, prepositional phrase attachment, and noun phrase/sentential complement attachment) were elicited from individuals with unilateral left hemisphere damage (LHD), right hemisphere damage (RHD), and adults without brain pathology ( NC). A written vignette preceding each ambiguous sentence target biased how the utterance was interpreted and produced. Recorded productions were analysed acoustically to examine parameters of duration (word length, pause) and fundamental frequency (F-0) for key constituents specific to each of the ambiguity conditions. Results of the duration analyses demonstrated a preservation of many of the temporal cues to syntactic boundaries in both LHD and RHD patients. The two interpretations of sentences containing 'scope' and 'prepositional phrase attachment' ambiguities were differentiated by all speakers (including LHD and RHD patients) through the production of at least one critical temporal parameter that was consistent across the three groups. Temporal markers of sentences containing 'noun phrase/sentential complement attachment' ambiguities were not found to be encoded consistently within any speaker group and may be less amenable to experimental manipulation in this manner. Results of F-0 analyses were far less revealing in characterizing different syntactic assignments of the stimuli, and coupled with other findings in the literature, may carry less weight than temporal parameters in this process. Together, results indicate that the ability to disambiguate sentences using prosodic variables is relatively spared subsequent to both LHD and RHD, although it is noteworthy that LHD patients did exhibit deficits regulating other temporal properties of the utterances, consistent with left hemisphere control of speech timing.

The present study uses computer simulations to evaluate such errors in a realistic head model and in the context of noise. Methods: A realistic head model was constructed from magnetic resonance imaging scans and 29 electrodes placed on the head according to the 10-20 International System. Twenty sets of electrode displacements, with a mean, value of 5 mm, were generated and 200 single dipoles evenly located in the brain were used as test sources. The boundary element method was employed for the froward calculation and dipole fitting was carried out at different noise levels. Results: For a noise-free signal, the source localization error due to electrode misplacement is about 5 mm, whereas it is about 2 mm for normal noisy signals. Conclusions: For realistic head models, dipole estimation error due to electrode misplacement is negligible compared with errors caused by noise. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

These impairments affect planning abilities, as well as the aptitude to initiate and regulate a goal-directed behaviour. On the other hand, negative symptoms of schizophrenia are widely suspected to reflect a frontal lobe dysfunction. Based on a review of a hundred papers, the present article analyses the anatomical and neuropsychological evidence of disturbed frontal lobe functioning in patients with negative schizophrenic symptoms. The phenomenological similarity of some schizophrenic symptoms to the clinical features of patients with prefrontal injury inspired the hypothesis of damaged frontal lobe in the former disorder. The morphological findings of neuroimaging studies brought inconsistent conclusions, with some researchers noting no differences between patients and control subjects while others observing reduced prefrontal volumes in schizophrenia. The functional neuroimaging demonstrated a reduced frontal blood flow relative to the general cerebral perfusion in patients with schizophrenia. Even though the overall neuroimaging literature provides reliable evidence of frontal impairment in schizophrenia, the average magnitude of the difference between patients and healthy controls is insufficient to defend the hypothesis of frontal lobe dysfunction, as far as brain volume, resting metabolism or blood flow are concerned. The only measure, which clearly distinguishes between the patients' and controls' distributions, is the functional neuroimaging of the frontal lobe while subjects are performing an experimentally controlled task. Schizophrenic patients fail to activate their frontal cortex when the task requires it. Analysing executive abilities in relation to symptom expression leads to recognising the fact that frontal dysfunction is a characteristic of only a subsyndrome of schizophrenia. The factor analysis of the clinical features consistently reveals three syndromes in schizophrenia, termed disorganisation, positive and negative syndromes. The substantial body of evidence that patients exhibit more than one syndrome indicates these are dimensions within a single illness rather than discrete diseases. Liddle labelled the negative syndrome as, psychomotor poverty and associated it with malfunction of the neuronal projections from dorsal prefrontal cortex to thalamus via striatum, connections involved in the initiation of mental activity. His hypothesis was supported by the work of other, independent research groups. The patients with negative symptoms, in contrast with the nonnegative symptom group, tend to demonstrate reduced neuronal activation of the frontal cortex during executive task realisation. The nonnegative patients are indistinguishable from the healthy control subjects in this region. Neuropsychological studies reveal that severity of psychomotor poverty is associated with slowing of mental processing and deficits in tasks that require planning abilities. These frontal functions are identified with the selection, the initiation and monitoring of a wide variety of behavioural processes. It was hypothesised that executive dysfunction will appear through different patterns across symptom subtypes, but few studies sought to validate this assumption. Finally, researchers make little effort to develop theoretical conceptualisations of the aetiology of negative schizophrenic symptoms, despite the growing body of evidence on its resemblance to the dorsolateral frontal lobe syndrome. Frith proposes that defects in the initiation of spontaneous action underlie these clinical phenomena, but his definition is not specific enough to be confronted to existing literature, neither has been empirically tested. Disturbed executive functioning has detrimental impact on the quality of daily living in patients with schizophrenia. Indirect observation of the latter accounts for defective long-term adaptation, which has been correlated to severity of negative symptoms and, although not consistently, to executive deficit as assessed by neuropsychological testing. Unfortunately, this area of research lacks ecologically valid studies. Measuring executive dysfunction as it occurs in the natural setting of the patient and validating dissociability of frontal deficits with respect to the schizophrenic symptomatology could lead to greater individualisation of treatment plans and therefore to more efficient therapy outcome.

J	Lavoie, K; Everett, J				Lavoie, K; Everett, J			Schizophrenia and Performance on the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST): deficits and rehabilitation	ENCEPHALE-REVUE DE PSYCHIATRIE CLINIQUE BIOLOGIQUE ET THERAPEUTIQUE			French	Article						frontal dysfunction; learning capacities; schizophrenia; WCST	REMEDIATION; TOMOGRAPHY	In recent years, there has been a sustained interest in the so-called - frontal hypothesis, of schizophrenia : the idea that clinical symptoms and cognitive deficits characteristic of schizophrenia might be explained by defective function of the frontal lobes. Several studies have attempted to test this hypothesis by examining the performance of schizophrenic subjects on the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST), a neuropsychological evaluation widely believed to reflect the functional capacity of frontal lobes. A typical finding is that schizophrenic patients demonstrate a tendency to perseverate in producing an inappropriate response in spite of negative feedback. This perseverative tendency resembles the perseveration often seen in patients with frontal brain damage. This article proposes a critical examination of the available evidence linking frontal deficits with schizophrenia via the WCST. As we will show, in most of these studies, only a relatively small number of the available measures on the WCST are made, and consequently many interesting cognitive capacities in schizophrenic subjects have not been adequately examined with this test. These "non-classical" measures will be described and critically examined with respect to their pertinence for further work on schizophrenic subjects. Of particular interest are the "failure to maintain set" which measures cognitive instability "conceptual responses" which can indicate a certain conceptual capacity even in subjects who show perseveration, and "learning to learn", which can demonstrate a capacity to profit from experience on the test. A second objective will be to critically examine the evidence concerning the capacity of schizophrenic patients to improve their performance on the WCST. To the extent that performance on the WCST reflects the functional level of cognitive capacities important for everyday life, any capacity in schizophrenic patients to improve their performance could have important implications for therapeutic intervention and re-education.

Methods: We studied eight patients (five women) with double cortex syndrome and intractable epilepsy. All had a comprehensive presurgical evaluation including prolonged video-EEG recordings and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Results: All patients had partial seizures, with secondary generalization in six of them. Neurologic examination was normal in all. Three were of normal intelligence, and five were mildly retarded. Six patients underwent invasive EEG recordings, three of them with subdural grids and three with stereotactic implanted depth electrodes (SEEG). Although EEG recordings showed multilobar epileptic abnormalities in most patients, regional or focal seizure onset was recorded in all. MRI showed bilateral subcortical band heterotopia, asymmetric in thickness in three. An additional area of cortical thickening in the left frontal lobe was found in one patient. Surgical procedures included multiple subpial transections in two patients, frontal lesionectomy in one, temporal lobectomy with amygdalohippocampectomy in five, and an additional anterior callosotomy in one. Five patients had no significant improvement, two had some improvement, and one was greatly improved. Conclusion: Our results do not support focal surgical removal of epileptogenic tissue in patients with double cortex syndrome, even in the presence of a relatively localized epileptogenic area.

Sexual experience allows animals to form instrumental associations between internal or external stimuli and behaviors that lead to different sexual rewards. Furthermore, Pavlovian associations between internal and external stimuli allow animals to predict sexual outcomes. These two types of learning build upon instinctual mechanisms to create distinctive, and seemingly "automated," patterns of sexual response. This article reviews the literature on conditioning and sexual behavior with a particular emphasis on incentive sequences of sexual behavior that move animals from distal to proximal with regard to sexual stimuli during appetitive phases of behavior and ultimately result in copulatory interaction and mating during consummatory phases of behavior. Accordingly, the role of learning in sexual excitement, in behaviors that bring about the opportunity to mate, in courtship and solicitation displays, in sexual arousal and copulatory behaviors, in sexual partner preferences, and the short- and long-term influence of copulatory experience on sexual and reproductive function is examined. Although hormone actions set the stage for sexual activity by generating the ability of animals to become sexually excited and aroused, it is each animal's unique experience with sexual behavior and sexual reward that molds the strength of responses made toward sexual incentives.

We have developed a retroviral system that expresses the parasitic enzyme and tested its capacity to activate the prodrug allopurinol to a cytotoxic metabolite. Cytotoxicity assays demonstrated that five non-small cell lung carcinoma cell lines transduced with the construct were sensitized to the prodrug by 2.1- to 7.6-fold compared with control values. This selectivity was not observed in seven other cell lines also expressing the construct, such as breast carcinoma. Assays indicated that enhanced cytotoxicity to allopurinol correlated with induction of apoptosis in lung cancer cells. The selectivity of this suicide gene was not explained either by the TbHGPRT expression or by the allopurinol accumulation. Our study shows that this novel system may represent a therapeutic tool for gene prodrug targeting of lung cancer, considering the fact that allopurinol is well tolerated in humans.

Frataxin function is believed to be related to mitochondrial iron metabolism and free radical production. In Friedreich ataxia, loss of dorsal root ganglia neurons occurs early in life, suggesting a developmental process. In addition, frataxin knockout mice die during embryonic life, further suggesting that frataxin is necessary for normal development. In this study we examine the role of frataxin in neuronal differentiation by using the P19 embryonic carcinoma cell line as a model system. We produced stably transfected clones with antisense or sense frataxin constructs. During retinoic acid-induced neurogenesis of frataxin-deficient cells there was a striking rise in cell death, while cell division remained unaffected. However, frataxin deficiency does not affect cell survival in cells induced to differentiate into cardiomyocytes. Frataxin deficiency enhances apoptosis of retinoic acid-stimulated cells, and the number of neuronal-like cells expressing MAP2 was dramatically reduced in these clones. In addition, we found that antisense clones induced to differentiate into neuroectoderm with retinoic acid have increased production of reactive oxygen species, and that only cells noncommitted to the neuronal lineages could be rescued by the addition of the antioxidant N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC). However, NAC treatment had no effect in increasing the number of terminally differentiated neuronal-like cells in frataxin-deficient clones' Our results suggest that frataxin deficiency may render cells susceptible to apoptosis after exposure to appropriate stimuli.

Route navigation was presumed to consist of a chain of view-action associations: A sequence of view images from a test route was obtained, pre-processed, and used to train a system of self-organizing maps. The converged networks consisted of a set of weights representing the learned views and a set encoding the actions to be carried out at those views. A view presented to the trained networks can thus associatively elicit the action coupled to it, allowing autonomous execution of the route. The data were presented to the system of networks using a simple place-dependent scheme, and a context-sensitive decision-maker was used to minimize potential recognition ambiguity during the execution stage.

Detecting such changes is even more difficult in intensive care unit (ICU) environments where clinicians are bombarded by a barrage of complex monitoring signals from various devices. Early detection accompanied by appropriate intervention can lead to improvement in patient care. Neural networks can be used as the basis for an intelligent early warning system. We developed time-delay neural networks (TDNN) for classifying and detecting hemodynamic changes. A matrix of physiological parameters were extracted from raw signals collected during cardiovascular experiments in mongrel dogs. These matrices represented several episodes of stable, decreasing, and increasing cardiac filling in normal, exerted, and heart failure conditions. The TDNN were trained with these matrices and subsequently tested to predict unseen cases. The TDNN perform remarkably not only in identifying all hemodynamic conditions, but also in quickly detecting their changes. On average, the networks were able to detect the hemodynamic changes in less than 1 s after the onset. Based on the results of this pilot investigation, the use of this form of TDNN to successfully predict hemodynamic conditions appears to be promising. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

All children under 5 years of age referred to either developmental pediatrics or pediatric neurology clinics at a single tertiary hospital over an 18-month period were prospectively identified. Standardized demographic and referral information were collected at intake, final developmental delay subtype diagnosed was identified, and referring physicians were surveyed regarding factors prompting referral. A total of 224 children met study criteria. There was a marked male preponderance (166/224), especially among those with either cognitive or language delay. Two delay subtypes, global developmental delay and developmental language disorder, accounted for two thirds of the diagnoses made. For slightly more than one third of the children (75/224), the delay subtype diagnosed following specialty evaluation was different from that initially suspected by the referring physician. A mean delay of 15.5 months was observed for the cohort as a whole between initial parental concern and specialty assessment. For referring physicians, the major factor prompting referral was the severity of the observed delay. The most important aspects of the specialty evaluation according to referral sources were the identification of a possible etiology and confirmation of delay. A profile of referrals and the rationale thereof for a cohort of children with suspected developmental delay is presented that, although locale specific, has implications for service provision and training.

The study population consisted of 138 ambulatory patients (age 16.4 +/- 5.6 yr; mean SD; 71 female) who were referred to a pediatric densitometry unit. Total volumetric bone mineral density (BMD) increased, whereas the area of the radial cross-section decreased in a proximal direction. There was a decrease in bone mineral content between sections 1 and 3, which was more pronounced in subjects under age 16. Cancellous BMD significantly decreased from section 1 to 3 only under the age of 16. In 12 patients under age 17 who suffered from increased bone fragility, cancellous BMD decreased about 2.5 times more between sections I and 3 than in age-matched patients who received anticonvulsant therapy but had a normal neurologic and musculoskeletal status (-21.4% +/- 16.9 vs -8.1% +/- 6.3; p = 0.02). This suggests that in the bone fragility group, trabeculae were removed faster during longitudinal growth of the radius. In conclusion, multiple slice analysis may provide information on the dynamic turnover of metaphyseal trabeculae during growth.

J	Magder, S; Lagonidis, D; Erice, F				Magder, S; Lagonidis, D; Erice, F			The use of respiratory variations in right atrial pressure to predict the cardiac output response to PEEP	JOURNAL OF CRITICAL CARE			English	Article							END-EXPIRATORY PRESSURE	Purpose: The purpose of this study was to determine whether the pattern of respiratory variation in right atrial pressure (Pra) predicts the cardiac output response to positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). Materials and Methods: We studied 18 patients with a variety of cardiac and pulmonary disorders requiring ventilatory support. A pulmonary artery flotation catheter was in place as part of their routine management. Changes in PEEP were made from 0 to 14 cm H2O to determine the level of PEEP which increased PO2 without decreasing cardiac output (ie, assessment of best PEEP). Static lung compliance and auto-PEEP were obtained from the pressure signal on the ventilator. The change in Pra with a spontaneous inspiratory effort (ie, triggered breath) was used to determine whether patients had a restrictive (ie, operating on the flat part of the Starling curve), or nonrestrictive pattern (acting on the ascending part of the Starling curve) as previously described. Results: Cardiac output decreased 0.7 +/- 0.8 L/min (change from baseline P < .05) in the group with an inspiratory decrease in Pra and -0.04 &PLUSMN; 1.50 L/min (P = NS) in the group without an inspiratory decrease in Pra. The groups were not significantly different. However, the variance in cardiac output was large and, in contrast to our hypothesis, two patients in the group with an inspiratory decrease in Pra did not have a decrease in cardiac output. Pra and pulmonary artery occlusion pressure after the PEEP trial were greater than before, indicating that reflex circulatory adjustments occurred in response to the PEEP. Conclusions: The inspiratory pattern in Pra does not predict the response to cardiac output to PEEP in individual patients. This is most likely because of reflex adaptations in the circuit that occur with the application of PEEP. The response of a patient to PEEP is affected by the patient's volume reserves, filling status of the right atrium, and neurosympathetic activity. Copyright (C) 2001 by W.B. Saunders Company.

J	Diksic, M; Young, SN				Diksic, M; Young, SN			Study of the brain serotonergic system with labeled alpha-methyl-L-tryptophan	JOURNAL OF NEUROCHEMISTRY			English	Review						autoradiography; brain synthesis; alpha-methyl-L-tryptophan; positron emission tomography; serotonin	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; KYNURENINE PATHWAY METABOLISM; GENERALIZED ANXIETY DISORDER; LUMBAR CEREBROSPINAL-FLUID; HEALTHY-HUMAN SUBJECTS; FREE SERUM TRYPTOPHAN; AMINO-ACID TRANSPORT; RAT-BRAIN; IN-VIVO; 5-HYDROXYINDOLEACETIC ACID	alpha -Methyl-L-tryptophan (alpha -MTrp) is an artificial amino acid and an analog of tryptophan (Trp), the precursor of the neurotransmitter serotonin (5-HT). In this article we have summarized available data, which suggest that the measurement of the unidirectional uptake of alpha -MTrp and its conversion to 5-HT synthesis rates is a valid approach for the determination of brain 5-HT synthesis rates. The main feature on which the model is based is the trapping of labeled alpha -MTrp in brain tissue. An overview of opposing opinions, which suggest that there is a need for a metabolic conversion of tracer, is also presented and discussed critically. As with all biological modeling there is likely to be room for improvements of the proposed biological model. In addition, there are a limited number of clearly defined circumstances in which the method is confounded by the metabolism of labeled alpha -MTrp via the kynurenine pathway. Nonetheless, a significant body of evidence suggests that labeled alpha -MTrp is a useful tracer to study brain 5-HT synthesis in most circumstances. Calculation of 5-HT synthesis rates depends on the plasma-free tryptophan concentration, which, according to the balance of arguments in the literature, is a more appropriate parameter than the total-plasma tryptophan. The method, as proposed by us, can be used in conjunction with autoradiographic measurements in laboratory animals, and with positron emission tomography in large animals and humans. We review studies in animals looking at the normal control of 5-HT synthesis and the way in which it is altered by drugs, as well as initial studies investigating healthy humans and patients with neuropsychiatric disorders.

Three monkeys were trained to grasp an unseen instrumented object between the thumb and index finger and to lift and hold it stationary within a position window for 2-2.5 s. The grip and load forces and the object displacement were measured on each trial. Sin.-le-unit activity was recorded from the hand regions in the PMv and PMd. In some conditions a predictable perturbation was applied to the object after 1,500 ms of static holding, whereas in other conditions different random combinations of perturbed and unperturbed trials were given. In the perturbed conditions, some were randomly and intermittently presented with a warning flash, whereas some were unsignaled. The activities of 198 cells were modulated during the task performance. Of these cells, 151 were located in the PMv, and 47 were located in the PMd. Although both PMv and PMd neurons had similar discharge patterns, more PMd neurons (84 vs. 43%) showed early pregrip activity. Forty of 106 PMv and 10/30 PMd cells responded to the perturbation with reflexlike triggered reactions. The latency of this response was always <100 ms with a mean of about 55 ms in both the PMv and the PMd. In contrast, 106 PMv and 30 PMd cells tested with the perturbations, only 9 and 10%, respectively, showed significant but nonspecific adaptations to the perturbation. The warning stimulus did not increase the occurrence of specific responses to the perturbation even though 21 of 42 cells related to the grip task also responded to moving visual stimuli. The responses were retinal and frequently involved limited portions of both foveal and peripheral visual fields. When tested with a 75 x 5.5-cm dark bar on a light background, these cells were sensitive to the direction of movement. In summary, the periarcuate premotor area activity to related to predictable force-pulse perturbations seems to reflect a general increase in excitability in contrast to a more specific anticipatory activity such as recorded in the cerebellum. In spite of the strong cerebello-thalamo-cortical projections, the results of the present study suggest that the cortical premotor areas are not involved in the elaboration of adaptive internal models of hand-object dynamics.

J	Boudreau, MJ; Smith, AM				Boudreau, MJ; Smith, AM			Activity in rostral motor cortex in response to predictable force-pulse perturbations in a precision grip task	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article							NEURONAL-ACTIVITY; SOMATOSENSORY CORTEX; 2 REPRESENTATIONS; FINGER MOVEMENTS; CORTICAL CONTROL; PREMOTOR CORTEX; HAND MUSCLES; MONKEY; PRIMATE; PREHENSION	The purpose of this investigation was to characterize the discharge of neurons in the rostral area 4 motor cortex (MI) during performance of a precision grip task. Three monkeys were trained to grasp an object between the thumb and index finger and to lift and hold it stationary for 2-2.5 s within a narrow position window. The grip and load forces and the vertical displacement of the object were recorded on each trial. On some trials a downward force-pulse perturbation generating a shear force and slip on the skin was applied to the object after 1.5 s of static holding. In total, 72 neurons were recorded near the rostral limit of the hand area of the motor cortex, located close to the premotor areas. Of these, 30 neurons were examined for receptive fields, and all 30 were found to receive proprioceptive inputs from finger muscles. Intracortical micro stimulation applied to 38 recording sites evoked brief hand movements, most frequently involving the thumb and index finger with an average threshold of 12 muA. Slightly more than one-half of the neurons (38/72) demonstrated significant increases in firing rate that on average began 284 +/- 186 ms before grip onset. Of 54 neurons tested with predictable force-pulse perturbations, 29 (53.7%) responded with a reflexlike reaction at a mean latency of 54.2 +/- 16.8 ms. This latency was 16 ms longer than the mean latency of reflexlike activity evoked in neurons with proprioceptive receptive fields in the more caudal motor cortex. No neurons exhibited anticipatory activity that preceded the perturbation even when the perturbations were delivered randomly and signaled by a warning stimulus. The results indicate the presence of a strong proprioceptive input to the rostral motor cortex, but raise the possibility that the afferent pathway or intracortical processing may be different because of the slightly longer latency.

Here we used slices of the rat subiculum (a limbic area involved in cognitive functions) to establish how network and single neuron (intrinsic) membrane mechanisms participate to the rhythmic oscillations elicited by the cholinergic agent carbachol (CCh, 50-100 muM). We have found that CCh-induced network oscillations (intraoscillatory frequency = 5-16 Hz) are abolished by an antagonist of non-N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) glutamatergic receptors (n = 6 slices) but persist during blockade of GABA receptors (n = 16). In addition, during application of glutamate and GABA receptor antagonists, single subicular cells generate burst oscillations at 2.1-6.8 Hz when depolarized with steady current injection. These intrinsic burst oscillations disappear during application of a Ca2+ channel blocker (n = 6 cells), intracellular Ca2+ chelation (n = 6), or replacement of extracellular Na+ (n = 4) but persist in recordings made with electrodes containing a blocker of voltage-gated Na+ channels (n = 7). These procedures cause similar effects on CCh-induced depolarizing plateau potentials that are contributed by a Ca2+-activated nonselective cationic conductance (I-CAN). Network and intrinsic oscillations along with depolarizing plateau potentials were abolished by the muscarinic receptor antagonist atropine. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that low-frequency oscillations in the rat subiculum rely on the muscarinic receptor-dependent activation of an intrinsic oscillatory mechanism that is presumably contributed by I-CAN and are integrated within the network via non-NMDA receptor-mediated transmission.

J	Diksic, M				Diksic, M			Labelled alpha-methyl-L-tryptophan as a tracer for the study of the brain serotonergic system	JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY & NEUROSCIENCE			English	Review						brain; models, biological; radioactive tracers; serotonin; serotonin uptake inhibitors; tomography, emission-computed; tryptophan; tryptophan hydroxylase	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; KYNURENINE PATHWAY METABOLISM; RAT-BRAIN; IN-VIVO; MONOAMINE-OXIDASE; 5-HYDROXYINDOLEACETIC ACID; AUTORADIOGRAPHIC METHOD; HYDROXYLASE ACTIVITY; CEREBROSPINAL-FLUID; HEALTHY-VOLUNTEERS	The alpha -methyl-L-tryptophan (alpha -MTrp) method for the study of the brain serotonergic system is based on the fact that labelled alpha -MTrp is taken up by and, in part, retained in the brain, and this retention (trapping) is proportional to brain serotonin (5-HT) synthesis. A 3-compartment model is proposed in which the plasma, the precursor and irreversible pools are mathematically distinct compartments. The irreversible compartment is assumed to be the one in which the tracer is trapped. By definition, the tracer from the irreversible compartment does not exchange directly with the plasma compartment. The rate at which labelled alpha -MTrp is trapped is converted to the rate of 5-HT synthesis by dividing it by a conversion factor called the lumped constant, and multiplying it by the plasma-free tryptophan concentration. Our results revealed that brain 5-HT synthesis can be influenced by the extraneuronal concentration of 5-HT and that, generally, the influence is not uniform throughout the brain. They also suggest that brain trapping of labelled alpha -MTrp relates to 5-HT synthesis. The proposed procedure for converting the rate at which labelled alpha -MTrp is trapped to brain 5-HT synthesis rates is based on measurements that suggest that plasma-free Trp relates to brain 5-HT synthesis. However, as with all biological models, there is likely room for improvement in our approach.

Acute or light alcohol consumption stimulates the release of opioid peptides in brain regions that are associated with reward and reinforcement and that mediate, at least in part, the reinforcing effects of ethanol. However, chronic heavy alcohol, consumption induces a central opioid deficiency, which may be perceived as opioid Withdrawal and may promote alcohol consumption through the mechanisms of negative reinforcement. The role of genetic factors in alcohol dependency is well recognized, and there is evidence that the activity of the endogenous opioid system under basal conditions and in response to ethanol may play a role in determining an individual's predisposition to alcoholism. The effectiveness of opioid receptor antagonists in decreasing alcohol consumption in people with an alcohol dependency and in animal models lends further support to the view that the opioid system may regulate, either directly or through interactions with other neurotransmitters, alcohol. consumption. A better understanding of the complex interactions between ethanol, the endogenous opioids and. other neurotransmitter systems will help to delineate the neurochemical mechanisms leading to alcoholism and may lead to the development of novel treatments.

DESIGN: Cross-sectional, observational study. SETTING: A university-based center. PARTICIPANTS: Fifty-six healthy volunteers (age 20-88 years). MEASUREMENTS: fERGs and OPs were first evaluated in scotopic conditions, following pupillary dilation and dark adaptation, in young (20-32 years; n = 30) and older (75-88 years; n = 26) individuals. Electrical signals were recorded with a Dawson-Trick-Litzkow type (DTL) fiber electrode in response to blue and white flashes. Red flashes were subsequently delivered to the test eye for photopic fERG and OP recordings following a period of light adaptation. RESULTS: The amplitude of the a- and b-waves in response to blue and white flashes was, significantly decreased in older people and their implicit time was increased. The latency of the a- and b-waves under photopic conditions was also prolonged with senescence, but only the amplitude of the b-wave was reduced. The amplitude of most OPs recorded under both scotopic and photopic conditions decreased with age, whereas their implicit times were prolonged. CONCLUSIONS: Our results confirm previous findings regarding the age dependency of the fERG a- and b-waves. Furthermore, we provide novel information concerning the detrimental effects of age on the OPs, indicating that the neuronal elements within the inner plexiform, layer of the retina are compromised with senescence.

Given the presumed large but previously unquantified degree of structural and functional variance among normal persons in the human population, the basis for this atlas and reference system is probabilistic. Through the efforts of the International Consortium for Brain Mapping (ICBM), 7,000 subjects will be included in the initial phase of database and atlas development. For each subject, detailed demographic, clinical, behavioral, and imaging information is being collected. In addition, 5,800 subjects will contribute DNA for the purpose of determining genotype-phenotype-behavioral correlations. The process of developing the strategies, algorithms, data collection methods, validation approaches, database structures, and distribution of results is described in this report. Examples of applications of the approach are described for the normal brain in both adults and children as well as in patients with schizophrenia. This project should provide new insights into the relationship between microscopic and macroscopic structure and function in the human brain and should have important implications in basic neuroscience, clinical diagnostics, and cerebral disorders.

Performance for these contrast-defined shapes, which we show is determined by the global rather than the local attributes of the stimulus, is 2-8 times worse than that for their luminance-defined counterparts, suggesting separate processing limitations. By spatially and orientationally filtering the two-dimensional fractal-noise carriers of which these stimuli were composed, we determined whether there are specific rules concerning the spatial and orientational input to shape detectors from mechanisms sensitive to the carrier structure. The results suggest that second-order circularity detectors receive mixed input from spatial-frequency-tuned and orientationally tuned cells. (C) 2001 Optical Society of America.

These cells derive from the dermis, and clones of individual cells can proliferate and differentiate in culture to produce neurons, glia, smooth muscle cells and adipocytes. Similar precursors that produce neuron-specific proteins upon differentiation can be isolated from adult human scalp. Because these cells (termed SKPs for skin-derived precursors) generate both neural and mesodermal progeny, we propose that they represent a novel multipotent adult stem cell and suggest that skin may provide an accessible, autologous source of stem cells for transplantation.

The autosomal recessive form described in Jews of Persian descent(2) is the HIBM prototype. This myopathy affects mainly leg muscles, but with an unusual distribution that spares the quadriceps(3). This particular pattern of weakness distribution, termed quadriceps-sparing myopathy (QSM), was later found in Jews originating from other Middle Eastern countries as well as in non-Jews(4). We previously localized the gene causing HIBM in Middle Eastern Jews on chromosome 9p12-13 (ref. 5) within a genomic interval of about 700 kb (ref. 6). Haplotype analysis around the HIBM gene region of 104 affected people from 47 Middle Eastern families indicates one unique ancestral founder chromosome in this community. By contrast, single non-Jewish families from India, Georgia (USA) and the Bahamas, with QSM and linkage to the same 9p12-13 region, show three distinct haplotypes. After excluding other potential candidate genes, we eventually identified mutations in the UDP-N-acetylglucosamine-2-epimerase/N-acetylmannosamine kinase (GIVE) gene in the HIBM families: all patients from Middle Eastern descent shared a single homozygous missense mutation, whereas distinct compound heterozygotes were identified in affected individuals of families of other ethnic origins. our findings indicate that GIVE is the gene responsible for recessive HIBM.

These topological surveys were carried out by quantitative ligand binding autoradiography using the uptake site antagonist [H-3]-citalopram as a probe of innervation densities in four quadrants of the rostral neostriatum and in two halves of the caudal neostriatum. In addition, tissue concentrations of 5-HT, 5-hydroxyindole-3-acetic acid and 5-hydroxytryptophol were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection in these neostriatal divisions. In +/+ mice and in Lc/+ mutants there was a dorso-ventral gradient of increasing 5-HT levels, and they exhibited a similar heterogeneity of [H-3]-citalopram labeling. In contrast, the gradients of 5-HT concentrations and [H-3]-citalopram binding disappeared in the weaver mutants, suggesting a rearrangement of the 5-HT innervation. This reorganization of the 5-HT system in the neostriatum was more obvious in the wv/wv and is compatible with the hypothesis that the postnatal dopaminergic deficiencies that characterize weaver mutants lead to a sprouting of fibers and thus constitute a genetic model of dopaminergic denervation that leads to a 5-HT hyperinnervation.

The unification comes from a single model for structural change, rather than two separate models, one for displacement and one for volume changes. The displacement velocity field rather than the displacement itself is used to set up a linear model to account for temporal variations. By introducing the rate of the Jacobian change of the deformation, the local volume change at each voxel can be computed and used to measure possible brain tissue growth or loss. We have applied this method to detecting regions of a morphological change in a group of children and adolescents. Using structural magnetic resonance images for 28 children and adolescents taken at different time intervals, we demonstrate how this method works. (C) 2001 Academic Press.

In this study we examined the previously uninvestigated area of olfactory working memory. Our aim was to investigate if olfactory working memory would engage,prefrontal regions known to be involved in working memory for other sensory modalities. Using positron emission, tomography we measured cerebral blood flow changes in 12 volunteers during an olfactory working memory task and a comparison visual working memory task. Our findings indicate that both olfactory and face working memory engaged dorsolateral and ventrolateral frontal cortex when the task requirements were matched; a conjunction analysis indicated overlap in the distribution of activity in the two tasks. Similarities and differences in activity were noted in parietal lobe regions, with both tasks engaging inferior areas of 40/7, but only visual working memory showing increased activity within left superior parietal cortex. The findings support the idea that working memory processes engage frontal cortical areas independent of the modality of input, but do not rule out the possibility of modality-specific neural populations within dorsolateral or ventrolateral cortex.

Seventy-two toluene-exposed printers were compared with 34 workers from the same photogravure plant with ambient background exposure, and with 19 workers from a bookbinding plant located in the same town (nonexposed). Environmental mean toluene exposure level at workstation was estimated from individual 8-h sampling. Historic exposure data from the last 30 years were used to construct two cumulative exposure indices, one for toluene and one for total hydrocarbons. Airborne toluene levels were overall lower than the current Threshold Limit Value (TLV) of 50 ppm. Color vision was assessed by the Lanthony D-15 desaturated panel. Color vision loss was quantitatively established by the Color Confusion Index (CCI) and classified by type of acquired dyschromatopsia according to Verriest's classification. CCI was positively related to current airborne toluene levels, and cumulative exposure indices for toluene and total hydrocarbons (.18 less than or equal to r less than or equal to .35). Odds ratios of acquired dyschromatopsia were significant for current airborne toluene, toluene, and total hydrocarbon past exposure (1.27 [1.02-1.58], 1.21 [1.04-1.39], 1.15 [1.02-1.31], respectively). In conclusion, this study suggests that the Lanthony D-15 desaturated panel detects early neurotoxic effects among workers exposed to toluene. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

This heptadecapeptide binds to the NOP1 (previously termed ORL1) receptor with exceedingly high affinity, but does not interact directly with classical opioid receptors. Functionally, the actions of OFQ/N are diverse and intriguing. Most work has focused upon pain mechanisms, where OFQ/N has potent anti-analgesic actions supraspinally and analgesic actions spinally. Other OFQ/N activities are less clear. The diversity of responses might reflect NOP1 receptor heterogeneity, but this remains to be established. The actions of this neurochemical system may also be uniquely dependent on contextual factors, both genetic and environmental. This review will address the molecular biology and behavioral pharmacology of OFQ/N and its receptor.

Here we reviewed more than 40 recent papers of positron emission tomography and functional magnetic resonance imaging related to language auditory perception, and we performed a meta-analysis of the localization of the peaks of activation in the Talairach's space. We found 8 studies reporting word versus non-word listening contrasts with 54 activation peaks in the temporal lobes. These peaks clustered in a bilateral and well-limited area of the temporal superior cortex, which is here operationally defined as the speech sensitive auditory cortex. This area is more than 4cm long, located in the superior temporal gyrus and the superior temporal sulcus, both anterior and posterior to Heschl's gyrus. It do not include the primary auditory cortex nor the ascending part of the planum temporale. The speech sensitive auditory cortex is not activated by pure tones, environmental sounds, or attention directed toward elementary components of a sound such as intensity, pitch, or duration, and thus has some specificity for speech signals. The specificity is not perfect, since we found a number of non-speech auditory stimuli activating the speech sensitive auditory cortex. Yet the latter studies always involve auditory perception mechanisms which are also relevant to speech perception either at the level of primitive auditory scene analysis processes, or at the level of specific schema-based recognition processes. The dorsal part of the speech sensitive auditory cortex may be involved in primitive scene analysis processes, whereas distributed activation of this area may contribute to the emergence of a broad class of "voice" schemas and of more specific "speech schemas/phonetic modules" related to different languages. In addition, this area is activated by language-related lip movement suggesting that a multimodal integration of the auditory and the visual information relevant in speech perception occurs at this level. Finally, there is a task-related top-down modulation of the pattern of activation of the speech sensitive auditory cortex which may reflect the fact that the different parts of this structure are connected to different down-stream cortical regions involved in the neural processing of different types of tasks.

Methods-We conducted an observational study from August 1992 to June 1999 of 125 unruptured aneurysms treated with GDC in 116 patients: 91 women (78.4%) and 25 men (21.6%), aged 30 to 78 years (mean age, 50.6 years). Immediate and late clinical results were recorded for any neurological event or hemorrhage related to the treated unruptured aneurysm. Angiographic results are reported as immediate, early (2 to 12 months), intermediate ( 12 to 30 months), and late follow-up (>30 months). Results-Immediate angiographic results showed complete obliteration (class 1) in 59 (47.2%) or residual neck (class 2) in 53 aneurysms (42.4%), leaving 6 residual aneurysms (4.8%) and 7 failures (5.6%). Early follow-up angiograms, available in 100 treated aneurysms (84%), revealed class 1 in 52% and class 2 in 41%. Intermediate angiograms, available in 53 aneurysms (44.5%), showed class 1 in 47.2% and class 2 in 43.4%, while late results, available in 37 lesions (31.1%), had class 1 and 2 in 48.6% and 37.8%, respectively. Six patients suffered a permanent neurological deficit at last follow-up (5.2%), with a good outcome in 5 patients and fair outcome in 1 patient. There was no mortality. There was no aneurysmal rupture during a mean clinical follow-up of 32.1 months. Conclusions-Endovascular treatment with GDC for unruptured aneurysms is relatively safe. Its role in the prevention of aneurysmal rupture remains to be determined, preferably by a randomized study.

However, numerous receptor-tyrosine kinases are expressed in multicomponent complexes with other receptors that may signal independently or alter the binding characteristics of the receptor-tyrosine kinase. Nerve growth factor (NGF) interacts with two structurally unrelated receptors, the Trk A receptor-tyrosine kinase and p75, a tumor necrosis factor receptor family member. Each receptor binds independently to NGF with predominantly low affinity (K-d = 10(-9) M), but they produce high affinity binding sites (K-d = 10(-11) M) upon receptor co-expression. Here we provide evidence that the number of high affinity sites is regulated by the ratio of the two receptors and by specific domains of Trk A and p75. Co-expression of Trk A containing mutant transmembrane or cytoplasmic domains with p75 yielded reduced numbers of high affinity binding sites. Similarly, co-expression of mutant p75 containing altered transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains with Trk A also resulted in predominantly low affinity binding sites. Surprisingly, extracellular domain mutations of p75 that abolished NGF binding still generated high affinity binding with Trk A. These results indicate that the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of Trk A and p75 are responsible for high affinity site formation and suggest that p75 alters the conformation of Trk A to generate high affinity NGF binding.

The PCI inhibitory sequence is mostly confined within a 10-12-amino acid segment near the C terminus of the conserved human proSAAS and contains the critical KR244 dibasic motif. Our results show that the decapeptide proSAAS-(235-244) (235)VLGALLRVKR(244) is the most potent reversible competitive PC1-inhibitor (K-i similar to9 nM). The C-terminally extended proSAAS-(235-246) exhibits a 5-6-fold higher K-i (similar to 51 nM). The additional LE sequence at P1'-P2', resulted in a competitive substrate cleaved by PCI at KR244 down arrow LE246. Systematic alanine scanning and in some cases lysine scanning tested the contribution of each residue within proSAAS(235-246) toward the PCI-inhibition's specificity and potency. The amino acids P1 Arg, P2 Lys, and P4 Arg are all critical for inhibition. Moreover, the aliphatic P3 Val and P5, P6, and P1' Leu significantly affect the degree of enzyme inactivation and PC1 specificity. Interestingly, a much longer N- and C-terminally extended endogenous rat proSAAS-(221-254) called little PenLen, was found to be a 3-fold less potent PCI inhibitor with reduced selectivity but a much better substrate than proSAAS-(235-246). Molecular modeling studies and circular dichroism analysis indicate an extended and poly-L-proline II type structural conformation for proSAAS-(235-244), the most potent PC1 inhibitor, a feature not present in poor PC1 inhibitors.

The NF2 protein, called schwannomin or merlin, is inactivated in virtually all schwannomas and meningiomas. The molecular mechanisms by which schwannomin functions as a tumor suppressor is unknown but believed to involve plasma membrane-cytoskeletal interactions. Two major alternatively spliced isoforms of schwannomin differing in their C termini have been reported. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, we have identified syntenin as a binding partner for schwannomin isoform-1 (sch-1). Syntenin is an adapter protein that couples transmembrane proteoglycans to cytoskeletal components and is involved in intracellular vesicle transport. The C terminus 25 amino acids of sch-1 and the two PDZ domains of syntenin mediate their binding, and mutations introduced within the VAFFEEL region of sch-1 defined a sequence crucial for syntenin recognition. We have showed that the two proteins interacted in vitro and in vivo and localized underneath the plasma membrane. Fibroblast cells expressing heterologous antisense syntenin display alterations in the subcellular distribution of sch-1. Together, these results provide the first functional clue to the existence of schwannomin isoforms and could unravel novel pathways for the transport and subcellular localization of schwannomin in vivo.

Through an International Consortium for Brain Mapping (ICBM) a dataset is being collected that includes 7000 subjects between the ages of eighteen and ninety years and including 342 mono- and dizygotic twins. Data on each subject includes detailed demographic, clinical, behavioural and imaging information. DNA has been collected for genotyping from 5800 subjects. A component of the programme uses post-mortem tissue to determine the probabilistic distribution of microscopic cyto- and chemoarchitectural regions in the human brain. This, combined with macroscopic information about structure and function derived from subjects in vivo, provides the first large scale opportunity to gain meaningful insights into the concordance or discordance in micro- and macroscopic structure and function. The philosophy, strategy, algorithm development, data acquisition techniques and validation methods are described in this report along with database structures. Examples of results are described for the normal adult human brain as well as examples in patients with Alzheimer's disease and multiple sclerosis. The ability to quantify the variance of the human brain as a function of age in a large population of subjects for whom data is also available about their genetic composition and behaviour will allow for the first assessment of cerebral genotype-phenotype-behavioural correlations in humans to take place in a population this large. This approach and its application should provide new insights and opportunities for investigators interested in basic neuroscience, clinical diagnostics and the evaluation of neuropsychiatric disorders in patients.

Impairments in verbal memory have been proposed to be a marker of risk for schizophrenia. Recently, relatives of schizophrenic patients have been reported to have reduced volume of the amygdala-hippocampal complex. In this study, we evaluate the possibility that amygdala-hippocampal volume reductions may constitute one neural substrate of verbal memory deficits in first-degree relatives. Subjects were 20 healthy first-degree, relatives of schizophrenic patients and 14 demographically similar controls. Verbal memory was assessed with the Logical Memory Test. Subjects were scanned with high-resolution MRI and the images were transformed into Talairach space. Volumes of interest were amygdala-anterior hippocampus and posterior hippocampus. Relatives of schizophrenic patients had intact immediate verbal memory but significantly poorer delayed verbal memory than controls. Relatives also had significantly reduced amygdala-anterior hippocampus volumes. Across all subjects, delayed verbal memory was significantly correlated with amygdala-anterior hippocampus volume. The magnitude of the correlation did not differ between the groups. These data provide an empirical link between memory performance and volumetric abnormalities in the amygdala-hippocampal complex in the relatives of schizophrenic patients.

Thirteen patients having been treated for 2 to 22 years with prednisone were recruited. On the average, none of the metabolites (NAA, Cr, Cho and ml) were significantly different from those of 40 normal subjects in any of the three regions studied: frontal area, thalamus and temporal area. However, the Cho/H2O ratios were found to decrease significantly in the thalamic area as a function of treatment period (-1.3%/year). In the frontal and temporal areas, decreases of the Cho/H2O ratios were measured with treatment period but they did not reach statistical significance. Effects on Cho levels can be related to those observed for patients with endogenous Cushing's syndrome and suggest an impairment at the membrane level. The Cho/H2O reductions were not found to be dose- or age-dependent. Other metabolite ratios did not vary with treatment period, dose or age. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Wheeler, DG; Cooper, E				Wheeler, DG; Cooper, E			Depolarization strongly induces human cytomegalovirus major immediate-early promoter/enhancer activity in neurons	JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							RAT SYMPATHETIC NEURONS; GENE-EXPRESSION; EARLY PROMOTER; ADENOVIRUS VECTOR; TRANSGENIC MICE; EARLY ENHANCER; CYCLIC-AMP; VIRUS; INDUCTION; TRANSCRIPTION	Activity-dependent changes in gene expression involving the transcription factor cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) occur in learning and memory, pain, and drug addiction. This mechanism may also be important for cytomegaloviral infections of the brain. The human cytomegalovirus major immediate-early promoter/enhancer (hCMV promoter), rate-limiting for productive cytomegalovirus infection, contains five cAMP-response elements (CREs). Indirect evidence suggests that this promoter does not function in unstimulated neurons. Here we test the hypothesis that expression from the hCMV promoter in neurons is induced by membrane depolarization. For these experiments, we infected cultured sympathetic and hippocampal neurons with hCMV-green fluorescent protein (GFP) promoter/reporter constructs using adenoviral gene transfer techniques and measured transgene expression by quantifying GFP fluorescence and GFP mRNA levels. We found that depolarization up-regulates promoter activity by > 90-fold. Moreover, our results from pharmacological experiments suggest that this induction occurred through a CREB-dependent pathway. Importantly, site-directed mutagenesis of all five CREs in the promoter blocked this up-regulation almost completely, whereas mutating four of them had no effect. We conclude that the bCMV promoter acts as a molecular switch in neurons and is strongly induced by membrane depolarization, neuronal activity, or other stimuli that activate CREB. These results may provide insight into molecular mechanisms of cytomegalovirus-related diseases of the brain.

They likely have an important role in ontogenesis because cytoskeletal rearrangements accompany cell differentiation and specialization. Western blotting showed that protein expression of RhoA, RhoB and Cdc42 RhoGTPases dramatically increased, in a programmed manner, during neuronal differentiation of P19 mouse embryonal carcinoma cells with retinoic acid. RhoA and Cdc42 expression were sequentially upregulated and peaked during the commitment period while that of RhoB was induced in post-mitotic neurons. Although RhoB had a higher expression on matrices allowing cell spreading and neurite elongation, it was distributed throughout cell volume by immunocytofluorescence and associated with various cell compartments by centrifugal subfractionation, suggesting a role not restricted at neurites at this stage of differentiation. RhoA and Cdc42 were mainly cytosolic and RhoB particulate in the P19 cell model. Treatment of cells with cytoskeleton disruptors showed that poisons of microtubules but not of actin filaments or neurofilaments increased the cytosolic level of RhoB. The results indicate that RhoA, Cdc42 and RhoB must intervene at specific stages of neuronal development and there exists a relationship between RhoB expression/distribution, the microtubule network and the extracellular matrix during this process.

Nerve growth factor is the cognate ligand for TrkA, brain-derived neurotrophic factor for TrkB, and neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) for TrkC. NT-3 also binds TrkA and TrkB as a heterologous ligand. All neurotrophins bind p75, which regulates ligand affinity and Trk signals. Trk extracellular domain has five subdomains: a leucine-rich motif, two cysteine-rich clusters, and immunoglobulin-like subdomains IgG-C1 and IgG-C2. The IgG-C1 subdomain is surface exposed in the tertiary structure and regulates ligand-independent activation. The IgG-C2 subdomain is less exposed but regulates cognate ligand binding and Trk activation. NT-3 as a heterologous ligand of TrkA and TrkB optimally requires the IgG-C2 but also binds other subdomains of these receptors. When p75 is co-expressed, major changes are observed; NGF-TrkA activation can occur also via the cysteine I subdomain, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor-TrkB activation requires the TrkB leucine-rich motif and cysteine 2 subdomains. We propose a two-site model of Trk binding and activation, regulated conformationally by the IgG-C1 subdomain. Moreover, p75 affects Trk subdomain utilization in ligand-dependent activation, possibly by conformational or allosteric control.

Previous analysis showed heterozygous mutations in the X-linked gene filamin 1 (FLN1), but examined only the first six (of 48) coding exons of the gene and hence did not assess the incidence and functional consequences of FLN1 mutations. Here we perform single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis of FLN1 throughout its entire coding region in six PH pedigrees, 31 sporadic female PH patients and 24 sporadic male PH patients. We detected FLN1 mutations by SSCP in 83% of PH pedigrees and 19% of sporadic females with PH. Moreover, no PH females (0/7 tested) with atypical radiographic features showed FLN1 mutations, suggesting that other genes may cause atypical PH. Surprisingly, 2/24 males analyzed with PH (9%) also carried FLN1 mutations. Whereas FLN1 mutations in PH pedigrees caused severe predicted loss of FLN1 protein function, both male FLN1 mutations were consistent with partial loss of function of the protein. Moreover, sporadic female FLN1 mutations associated with PH appear to cause either severe or partial loss of function. Neither male could be shown to be mosaic for the FLN1 mutation in peripheral blood lymphocytes, suggesting that some neurons in the intact cortex of PH males may be mutant for FLN1 but migrate adequately. These results demonstrate the sensitivity and specificity of DNA testing for FLN1 mutations and have important functional implications for models of FLN1 protein function in neuronal migration.

We have named this mutant degenerating muscle (dmu). At birth, mutant mice are indistinguishable from their normal littermates. Thereafter, the disease progresses rapidly and a phenotype is first observed at similar to 11 days after birth; the dmu mice are weak and have great difficulty in moving. The principal cause of the lack of mobility is muscle atrophy and wasting in the hindquarters. Affected mice die at or around the time of weaning of unknown causes. Histopathological observations and ultrastructural analysis revealed muscle degeneration in both skeletal and cardiac muscle, but no abnormalities in sciatic nerves. Using linkage analysis, we have mapped the dmu locus to the distal portion of mouse chromosome 15 in a region syntenic to human chromosome 12q13. Interestingly, scapuloperoneal muscular dystrophy (SPMD) in humans has been linked to this region. SPMD patients with associated cardiomyopathy have also been described in the past. Initial analysis of candidate genes on mouse chromosome 15 reveal that although intact transcripts for Scn8a, the gene encoding the sodium channel 8a subunit, are present in dmu mice, their levels are dramatically reduced. Furthermore, genetic complementation crosses between dmu and med (mutation in Scn8a) mice revealed that they are allellic. Our results suggest that at least a portion of the dmu phenotype is caused by a down-regulation of Scn8a, making dmu a new allelle of Scn8a.

Human studies have reported conflicting findings but have often suffered from inadequate psychophysical measures and/or poor lesion localization. We tested patients with unilateral temporal lobe excisions either encroaching on or sparing Heschl's gyrus (HG), quantifying lesion extent using anatomical magnetic resonance imaging measures. Subjects performed two tasks. In the localization task, they heard single clicks in a free-field spatial array subtending 180 degrees of azimuth and indicated the perceived location with a laser pointer. In the discrimination task, two clicks were presented, and subjects indicated if they were in the same or different position. As a group, patients with right temporal excision, either encroaching onto HG or not, were significantly impaired in both hemifields in both tasks, although this was not true for all individuals. Patients with left temporal resections generally performed normally, although some of the patients with left HG excision showed impaired performance bilaterally, especially in the discrimination task. This pattern stands in marked contrast to previous studies showing significant preservation of localization in hemispherectomized patients. We conclude that (1) contrary to hypotheses derived from animal studies, human auditory spatial processes are dependent primarily on cortical areas within right superior temporal cortex, which encompass both spatial hemifields; (2) functional reorganization may not take place after restricted focal damage but only after more extensive early damage; and (3) the existence of individual differences likely illustrates differential patterns of functional lateralization and/or recovery.

Several galanin receptor subtypes are present in dorsal root ganglia and spinal cord with a differential distribution. Here, we describe a generation of a specific galanin R2 (GalR2) agonist, AR-M1896, and its application in studies of a rat neuropathic pain model (Bennett). The results show that in normal rats mechanical and cold allodynia of the hindpaw are induced after intrathecal infusion of low-dose galanin (25 ng per 0.5 mul/h). The same effect is seen with equimolar doses of AR-M1896 or AR-M961, an agonist both at GalR1 and GalR2 receptors. In allodynic Bennett model rats, the mechanical threshold increased dose-dependently after intrathecal injection of a high dose of AR-M961, whereas no effect was observed in the control or AR-M1896 group. No effect of either of the two compounds was observed in nonallodynic Bennett model rats. These data indicate that a low dose of galanin has a nociceptive role at the spinal cord level mediated by GalR2 receptors, whereas the antiallodynic effect of high-dose galanin on neuropathic pain is mediated by the GalR1 receptors. Thus, a selective GalR1 agonist may be used to treat neuropathic pain.

Short puffs of air administered to the nose of awake, quietly resting adult rats elicited potentials that could be altered by one of several treatments (saline, atropine methyl nitrate or atropine sulfate). The change produced by blocking muscarinic receptors in the central nervous system with atropine sulfate (100 mg/kg) was the largest, but control substances also altered the potential, suggesting that the gradual changes observed in the evoked potential 30 min after intraperitoneal injection may also be affected by factors such as the stress associated with injection itself and the blockade of peripheral muscarinic receptors. The changes observed in the evoked potential when central cholinergic receptors are blocked include a large shift towards positivity in the early components (between 18 and 64 ms with maxima at 20 and 47 ms) and a similarly significant shift towards negativity in the later components (between 90 and 208 ms with maxima at 115 and 157 ms). The actual changes observed during inactivation of central muscarinic receptors suggest that the role of acetylcholine during arousal is more than to simply bias the cortex towards greater excitability. Rather, the muscarinic receptors on inhibitory interneurons or on the dendritic terminals of pyramidal cells in superficial layers of cortex enhance the first intracortical synaptic events but reduce the population response at later times during the first 250 ms following a tactile stimulus.

This habituation-like paradigm increased the size of an early component of the potential in several places. When measured with respect to the time of stimulus onset (there was a 21.6 ms delay in the time of arrival of the stimulus maximum at the nose), one of the largest increases occurred 46 ms later (39 ms latency to onset, and 55 ms latency to offset). As well, a late component of the waveform became more positive, showing a maximum between 156 and 185 ms (133 ms latency to onset, and more than 250 ms latency to offset). Changing the pattern but not the number of stimuli accelerated the rate of this positive shift with a maximum at 37 ms (21 ms latency to onset, and 42 ms latency to offset), but did not affect the rate of change in the late component. This effect of altering the temporal pattern of the stimuli was blocked by systemic injections of atropine sulfate, a blocker of central muscarinic receptors, whereas, neither saline injections nor atropine methyl nitrate injections (an atropine analog that does not cross the blood-brain barrier) could produce these changes. These observations suggest that the adaptive changes of the somatosensory evoked potential induced by novel patterns intercalated in otherwise monotonous repetitive somatic stimuli depend upon central muscarinic mechanisms.

In addition to the well-studied gene expression in the cerebellum causing massive primary Purkinje cell loss, the ROR alpha gene is also expressed in the thalamus and the olfactory bulb. A quantitative histochemical study of cytochrome oxidase activity was performed in staggerer mutants and their respective controls in order to determine whether olfactory bulb neuropathology leads to neuronal metabolic alterations in olfactory and related limbic regions. In the staggerer olfactory bulb, the core and the shell of the glomeruli had lower levels of cytochrome activity, whereas higher levels were found in the external plexiform and granular layers. Other olfactory and limbic regions were unchanged, except for a higher level in the accessory olfactory bulb and a lower level in the most ventral part of the medial orbital cortex. These results are discussed with regard to the olfactory deficits and changes in social interactions previously observed in this mutant. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Methods: The Canadian Pediatric Ischemic Stroke Registry was initiated in 1992 at the 16 pediatric tertiary care centers in Canada. Children (newborn to 18 years of age) with symptoms and radiographic confirmation of sinovenous thrombosis were included. Results: During the first six years of the registry, 160 consecutive children with sinovenous thrombosis were enrolled, and the incidence of the disorder was 0.67 case per 100,000 children per year. Neonates were most commonly affected. Fifty-eight percent of the children had seizures, 76 percent had diffuse neurologic signs, and 42 percent had focal neurologic signs. Risk factors included head and neck disorders (in 29 percent), acute systemic illnesses (in 54 percent), chronic systemic diseases (in 36 percent), and prothrombotic states (in 41 percent). Venous infarcts occurred in 41 percent of the children. Fifty-three percent of the children received antithrombotic agents. Neurologic deficits were present in 38 percent of the children, and 8 percent died; half the deaths were due to sinovenous thrombosis. Predictors of adverse neurologic outcomes were seizures at presentation and venous infarcts. Conclusions: Sinovenous thrombosis in children affects primarily neonates and results in neurologic impairment or death in approximately half the cases. The occurrence of venous infarcts or seizures portends a poor outcome. (N Engl J Med 2001;345:417-23.) Copyright (C) 2001 Massachusetts Medical Society.

The coincidence of self-destructiveness and 5-HT abnormality in BN is of interest, given documentation (in various populations) of an inverse association between 5-HT activity and potential for self-harm. The present study examined the connection between 5-HT status and self-destructiveness in BN. Structured interviews and self-report questionnaires were used to assess 40 bulimic and 21 normal-cater women for: (a) history of parasuicidal or self-injurious acts; and (b) mood and impulse-regulation problems. We then applied tests, presumed to reflect 5-HT function, of serial prolactin (PRO and cortisol (CORT) responses after oral administration of the partial 5-HT agonist., meta-chlorophenylpiperazine (m-CPP). Relative to non-bulimic women, bulimic women (on average) showed blunting of PRL and CORT following m-CPP. The blunting of neuroendocrine responses was, however, most remark-able in bulimic women with a history of self-destructiveness, These findings suggest that some serotonergic anomalies reported in BN sufferers (i.e. reduced neuroendocrine response after in-UP) may be most characteristic of individuals in the population showing clear-cut self-destructive potential.

Here, we have identified and cloned the rat germinal center kinase-like kinase (rGLK), a member of the GCK (germinal center kinase) family of e-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activating enzymes, as a novel endophilin I-binding partner. The interaction occurs both in vitro and in cells and is mediated by the Src homology 3 domain of endophilin I and a region of rGLK containing the endophilin consensus-binding sequence PPRPPPPR. Overlay analysis of rat brain extracts demonstrates that endophilin I is a major Src homology 3 domain-binding partner for rGLK. Overexpression of full-length endophilin I activates rGLK-mediated JNK activation, whereas N- and C-terminal fragments of endophilin I block JNK activation. Thus, endophilin I appears to have a novel function in JNK activation.

We recently demonstrated that 15-F-2t-IsoP is metabolized in humans to a major metabolite, 2,3-dinor-5,6-dihydro-15-F-2t-IsoP (15-F-2t-IsoP-M). 15-F-2t-IsoP-M can also potentially be formed as a product of free radical-induced oxidation of the low abundance fatty acid gamma -linolenic acid. We confirmed that 15-F-2t-IsoP-M is generated during oxidation of gamma -linolenic acid and explored whether it may exhibit biological activity. 15-F-2t-IsoP-M caused marked constriction of porcine surface retinal and intraparenchymal brain microvessels, comparable to that observed with 15-F-2t-IsoP. These effects were associated with increased thromboxane A(2) (TXA(2)) formation and were virtually abolished by TXA(2)-synthase and -receptor inhibitors (CGS-12970 and L-670596). Vasoconstriction induced by either 15-F-2t-IsoP or 15-F2t-IsoP-M on perfused ocular choroid was also abrogated by TXA(2)-synthase inhibition as well as by removal of endothelium. Similar to 15-F-2t-IsoP, 15-F-2t-IsoP-M evoked vascoconstriction and TXA(2) generation by activating Ca2+ influx from nonvoltage-gated channels (SK&F96365 sensitive) in the retina and from both non-voltage- and N-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (omega -conotoxin MVIIA sensitive), respectively, in brain endothelial and astroglial cells; smooth muscle cells were unresponsive to both agents. Cross-desensitization experiments further suggest that 15-F-2t-IsoP and 15-F-2t-IsoP-M act on the same receptor mechanism. Findings reveal a novel concept by which a beta -oxidation metabolite of 15-F-2t-IsoP that can also be formed by nonenzymatic oxidation of gamma -linolenic acid is equivalently bioactive to 15-F-2t-IsoP and may prolong the vascular actions of F-2-IsoPs.

With changing PS, we found no evidence for changes in neuromechanical coupling of the diaphragm. From lowest to highest PS (2 cm H2O +/- 4 to 20 cm H2O +/- 7), tidal volume increased from 430 ml 180 to 527 ml 180 (p < 0.001). The inspiratory volume calculated during the period when EAdi increased to its peak did not change from 276 +/- 147 to 277 +/- 162 ml, p = 0.976. Respiratory rate decreased from 23.9 (+/-7) to 21.3 (+/-7) breaths/min (p = 0.015). EAdi and Pdi decreased proportionally by adding PS (r = 0.84 and r = 0.90, for mean and peak values, respectively). Mean and peak EAdi decreased (p < 0.001) by 33 +/- 21% (mean +/- SD) and 37 +/- 23% with the addition of 10 cm H2O Of PS, Similar to the decrease in the mean and peak Pdi (p < 0.001) observed (34 <plus/minus> 36 and 35 +/- 23%). We also found that ventilator assist continued during the diaphragm deactivation period, a phenomenon that was further exaggerated at higher PS levels. We conclude that EAdi is a valid measurement of neural drive to the diaphragm in acute respiratory failure.

This study was designed to compare early (2 min after rapacuronium) or late (at 25% recovery of the first twitch [T1] of train-of-four) reversal of rapacuronium with neostigmine. We studied 119 subjects between the ages of 18 and 75 yr. Anesthesia was induced with fentanyl and thiopental and maintained with nitrous oxide, propofol, and fentanyl. Mechanomyographic neuromuscular monitoring was performed by using train-of-four stimulation of the ulnar nerve. Two groups received 1.5 mg/kg rapacuronium followed by neostigmine (50 mug/kg) and glycopyrrolate (10 mug/kg) either at 2 min after rapacuronium bolus or at 25% TI recovery. The other two groups received 2.0 mg/kg rapacuronium, after which neostigmine was similarly given. For each rapacuronium dose, the time from the administration of rapacuronium to the start of Tl recovery or 25% T1 recovery was significantly shorter in subjects who received the reversal 2 min after rapacuronium. However, late recovery, defined by times from administration of rapacuronium to 70%, or 80% T4/T1 recovery, was not influenced by early reversal administration. We conclude that initial recovery is accelerated by early administration of neostigmine. Time to full recovery after rapacuronium administration is, however, dose-dependent and not significantly altered by early administration of neostigmine.

It is unclear whether the same modifications occur with newer nondepolarizing agents and depolarizing agent succinylcholine. The purpose of this study was to determine the relative sensitivity of newborn neuromuscular junctions to succinylcholine and five nondepolarizing agents. Methods: The phrenic nerve-hemidiaphragm. preparation from 60 rats was used, 30 aged 9-12 days (newborn) and 30 aged 27-33 days (adult). Five rats from each group were exposed to one of six neuromuscular blocking agents (d-tubocurarine, cisatracurium, atracurium, vecuronium, rocuronium, and succinylcholine). Indirectly elicited twitch tension was measured during control conditions in the absence of blocking agent, followed by four concentrations of one of the six agents. Concentration-response curves were constructed and the EC50 (concentration required to produce 50% depression of twitch tension) was obtained. Potency ratios (EC50adult/EC50newborn) were derived for each agent. Results: Newborn preparations were significantly (P < 0.001) more sensitive than their adult counterparts for all six agents tested. For nondepolarizing agents, the potency ratio was in the 6-12 range. The EC50adult/EC50newborn were as follows, in decreasing potency order: d-tubocurarine, 1.68/0.23 muM; cisatracurium, 2.73/0.47 muM; vecuronium, 5.47/0.59 muM; rocuronium, 9.7/0.78 muM; and atracurium, 12.3/1.9 muM. Succinylcholine was three times as potent in newborn rats, with an EC50adult/EC50newborn of 21.3/7.3 muM. The ratio for succinylcholine was significantly less than for all nondepolarizing drugs (P < 0.02). Conclusion. The newborn neuromuscular junction of the rat shows an increased sensitivity to all neuromuscular blocking agents tested, including succinylcholine. However, the potency ratio was greater for nondepolarizing than depolarizing drugs. The optimal dose of these agents for certain situations such as cesarean section and anesthesia in neonates should be reassessed.

Several investigators have recently proposed that mental practice could be used by these patients as a therapeutic tool to improve their performance of motor functions, yet very little empirical work addresses this issue directly. This article discusses the rationale for investigating mental practice as a means of promoting motor recovery in patients with a neurologic disorder. We first present evidence supporting the existence of a similarity between executed and imagined actions using data from psychophysical, neurophysiologic, and brain imaging studies. This parallel is then extended to the repetition of movements during physical and mental practice of a motor skill. Finally, a new model is proposed to emphasize the key role of motor imagery as an essential process of mental practice, and also to stimulate additional research on this type of training in the rehabilitation of patients with motor impairments of cerebral origin.

Among other physiological actions, plasma CP was shown to protect isolated rat hearts and cultured P19 neurons exposed to oxidative stress conditions, raising the possibility of using this protein in the treatment of cardiac and neuronal diseases related to oxidative damage. However, since therapeutic applications of CP must be compatible with restrictions in the administration of blood derivatives to humans, there is a need to produce the protein by genetic engineering. To help in the choice of adequate expression systems, we undertook this study to determine if the carbohydrate moiety on the protein is essential for its functions. CP was completely deglycosylated using N-glycosidase F under nondenaturing conditions. Deglycosylated CP was found to retain most of the conformational, antioxidant, and enzymatic properties of the native protein in vitro. Moreover, both forms of the protein had similar cardioprotective and neuronoprotective effects against oxidative stress as evaluated with isolated rat hearts undergoing ischemia-reperfusion and with cultured P19 neurons exposed to xanthine - xanthine oxidase. The data thus indicate that the carbohydrate moiety of CP is not essential for its enzymatic and protective actions. Accordingly, even the use of expression systems that do not glycosylate mammalian proteins could provide a recombinant CP that retains its therapeutic potential.

This study tests this hypothesis in relatives of probands from well-characterized multiplex families affected with bipolar affective disorder (BAD). Methods: In a double-blind, crossover design, 20 unaffected relatives (URs) and 19 control subjects received either a 100-g amino acid (AA) drink devoid of tryptophan or a placebo, respectively. Clinical and biochemical effects of ATD were compared between unaffected relatives of BAD probands and age- and sex-matched control subjects. Results: At 5 hours after AA drink ingestion, relative to the placebo, ATD resulted in 74% and 84%, decreases in total plasma tryptophan concentrations in control subjects and relatives of patients with BAD, respectively. Unlike control subjects unaffected relatives experienced a lowering of mood during ATD but not with the placebo. Furthermore, URs tended to show increased impulsivity in the ATD condition. Measurements obtained before ingestion of the AA drink indicated that, relative to control subjects URs exhibited lower serotonin platelet concentrations, lower affinity and fewer binding sites of the serotonin transporter for imipramine; these differences it-ere unaffected by ATD. Conclusion: These results replicate and extend previous findings suggesting that URs of patients with BAD are more susceptible to low tryptophan availability. This finding mm, bear significance in the purported role of serotonergic mechanisms in the vulnerability, to depressive syndrome and/or illness. (C) 2001 Society of Biological Psychiatry.

The present study examines the involvement of different intracellular signaling pathways and their physiopathologic consequences following the CD4-independent interaction between CXCR4 or CCR5 and gp120 in different cell types: primary T cells, CD4(-)/ CXCR4(+)/CCR5(+) T cells, or glioma cells. These interactions were compared with those obtained with natural ligands, stromal cell-derived factor 1 alpha (SDIF-1 alpha) (CXCL12) and macrophage inflammatory protein 1 beta (MIP-1 beta) (CCL4) of their respective coreceptors. Thus, both p38 and SAPK/Jun N-terminal kinase mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) are activated on stimulation of these cells with either T- or M-tropic gp120, as well as with SDF-1 alpha. or MIP-1 beta. In contrast, extracellular signal-related kinase 1 and 2 MAPKs are only activated by MIP-1 beta but not by M-tropic gp120. Importantly, T- and M-tropic gp120 are able to induce the secretion of matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9), an extracellular metalloproteinase present In cerebrospinal fluid of patients with HIV-1 by T cells or glioma cells. Specific inhibition of MAPK p38 activation resulted in a complete abrogation of the induction of the MMP-9 pathogenic factor expression by gp120 or chemokines in both cell types. Because neurodegenerative features in acquired Immune deficiency syndrome dementia may involve demyelinization by MMP-9, the specific targeting of p38 could provide a novel means to control HIV-induced cytopathogenic effects and cell homing to viral replication sites.

A beta (1) (42) (5, 10, or 20 muM) was able to increase NO release and decrease cellular viability in primary rat cortical mixed cultures. 2 L-NOARG and SMTC (both at 10 or 100 muM) - type I NOS inhibitors - reduced cellular NO release in the absence of A beta (1) (42). At 100 muM, both drugs decreased cell viability. 3 L-NIL (10 or 100 pm), and 1400W (1 or 5 muM) type II NOS inhibitors - reduced NO release and improved viability when either drug was administered up to 4 h post A beta (1) (42) (10 muM) treatment. L-NOARG and SMTC (both at 10 or 100 muM) were only able to decrease NO release. Carboxy-PTIO or Trolox (both at 10 or 100 muM) - a NO scavenger and an antioxidant, respectively increased viability when administered up to 1 h post A beta (1) (42) treatment. Either L-NIL (50 muM) or 1400W (3 muM) and Trolox (50 muM) showed synergistic actions. 4 Peroxynitrite (100 or 200 muM) reduced cell viability. Viabilities were improved by L-NIL (100 muM), 1400W (5 muM), carboxy-PTIO (10 or 100 muM), and Trolox (10 or 100 muM). 5 Hence, the data show that A beta (1) (42) induced NO release in neurons and glial cells, and that A beta neurotoxicity is, at least in part, mediated by NO. NO concentration modulating compounds and antioxidant may have therapeutic importance in neurological disorders where oxidative stress is likely involved such as in AD.

In this paper, we report the cloning of a new human member of the NEP family that we named MMEL2 for membrane metallo-endopeptidase-like 2. The MMEL2 protein has the structural characteristics of type Il transmembrane proteins, although the presence of a furin-like cleavage site in the ectodomain suggests that it may be released into the medium following proteolytic cleavage. The MMEL2 protein contains the zinc-binding consensus sequence HEXXH and all the residues known to be essential for the enzymatic activity of other members of the family. The MMEL2 mRNA was detected predominantly in testis, but weak expression also was observed in brain, kidney, and heart. The human MMEL2 gene was mapped to 1p36 by fluorescence in situ hybridization. It will be important to test whether MMEL2 defects are associated with diseases such as hereditary motor sensory neuropathy 2A, Schwartz-Jampel-Aberfeld syndrome, or neuroblastoma, which all map to this locus.

The purpose of the present study was to determine whether a reduction of the central component of physiological tremor would correlate with a reduction of motor performance. Then, the power distribution in the frequency spectrum of tremor from limb extremities might serve as an index of neural drive in healthy elderly subjects. Rest tremor, postural tremor from the finger, and pronation-supination at the wrist were recorded in 102 healthy nuns living in a convent (mean of 72 +/- 12 years). Results reveal that several elderly subjects possessed a power distribution of tremor very similar to that of much younger subjects (mean 27 years +/- 3 SD), showing a preponderance of power within the 7.6- to 12.5-Hz band. Duration of pronation-supination cycles of these elderly subjects was, however, similar to that of other elderly subjects who had a preponderance of power within the 3.6- to 7.5-Hz band. Consequently, healthy elderly subjects who possessed a predominance of power within higher frequencies were not at an advantage over other healthy elderly subjects when performing a pronation-supination task. The age of subjects was, however, a better predictor or motor performance. In conclusion, the present findings suggest that, under normal physiological conditions, a reduction of the central component of physiological tremor does not induce a reduction of motor performance. Consequently, tremor recorded at limb extremities cannot be used as an index of neural drive.

The mechanisms involved in the negative inotropic and chronotropic effects of oxytocin were investigated in isolated dog right atria in the absence of central mechanisms. Perfusion of atria through the sinus node artery with 10(-6) mol/L oxytocin over 5 minutes (8 mL/min) significantly decreased both beating rate (-14.7 +/-4.9% of basal levels, n=5, P<0.004) and force of contraction (-52.4<plus/minus>9.1% of basal levels, n=5, P<0.001). Co-perfusion with 10(-6) mol/L oxytocin receptor antagonist (n=3) completely inhibited the effects of oxytocin on frequency (P<0.04) and force of contraction (P<0.004), indicating receptor specificity. The effects of oxytocin were also totally inhibited by co-perfusion with 5 X 10(-8) mol/L tetrodotoxin (P<0.02) or 10(-6) mol/L atropine (P<0.03) but not by 10(-6) mol/L hexamethonium, which implies that these effects are neurally mediated, primarily by intrinsic parasympathetic postganglionic neurons. Co-perfusion with 10(-6) mol/L NO synthase inhibitor (L-NAME) significantly inhibited oxytocin effects on both beating rate (-1.85<plus/minus>1.27% versus -14.7 +/-4.9% in oxytocin alone, P<0.05) and force of contraction (-24.9<plus/minus>4.4% versus -52.4 +/-9.1% in oxytocin alone, n=4, P<0.04). The effect of oxytocin on contractility was further inhibited by L-NAME at 10(-4) mol/L (-8.1<plus/minus>1.8%, P<0.01). These studies imply that the negative inotropic and chronotropic effects of oxytocin are mediated by cardiac oxytocin receptors and that intrinsic cardiac cholinergic neurons and NO are involved in these actions.

J	Thompson, CJ; Kecani, S; Boelen, S				Thompson, CJ; Kecani, S; Boelen, S			Evaluation of a neck shield for use during neurological studies with a whole-body PET scanner	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NUCLEAR SCIENCE			English	Article								It is well known that the shielding against out-of-field scattered radiation is not very effective on whole-body positron emission tomography (PET) scanners operated with their slice-defining septa retracted. Additional shielding can be employed during neurological studies since the diameter of the head is much less than the field of view required for imaging the human torso. We have designed, built, and tested (on the CTI HR+PET scanner) a new lead-plate shielding system that mounts on the scanner's removable headrest. We call this device the "NeuroShield." The outer diameter of the 9-mm-thick lead plate is 550 mm, which has a "U"-shaped hole 220 min. in diameter. It is positioned just above the subject's shoulders. A molded plastic coupling piece, produced by stereo-lithography, was designed to accommodate the complex shape of the headrest under the subject's neck and provide a flat surface for mounting the lead plate. Our testing on human subjects involved comparing the prompt and random count rates and dead time during bolus-water activation studies. Scans on different subjects (matched for age and sex) with no additional shielding, with the CTI neurological insert, and with the NeuroShield were compared. The random counts were reduced by a factor of 1.56 when using the permanent CTI neurological insert and 1.44 using the NeuroShield. The NeuroShield is easily removed to allow whole-body scanning. It can remain in place as the couch extends through the scanning tunnel in the gantry. Its main application will be at PET centers doing a mixture of whole-body and neurological studies, where the CTI neurological insert cannot be installed permanently.

Patients and Methods: A total of 91 pediatric patients, 83 of whom were fully assessable for response and toxicity, received cyclophosphamide (250 mg/m(2)/dose) followed by topotecan (0.75 mg/m(2)/dose), each given as a 30-minute infusion daily for 5 days. All patients received filgrastim (5 mcg/kg) daily until the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) was greater than or equal to 1,500 muL after the time of the expected ANC nadir. Results: A total of 307 treatment courses were given to the 83 fully assessable patients. Responses (complete response plus partial response) were seen in rhabdomyosarcoma (10 of 15 patients), Ewing's sarcoma (six of 17 patients), and neuroblastoma (six of 13 patients). Partial responses were seen in two of 18 patients with osteosarcoma and in one patient with a Sertoli-Leydig cell tumor. Twenty-three patients had either minor responses (n = 6) or stable disease (n = 17); the median number of courses administered to patients with partial or complete response was six (range, two to 13 courses), and the median administered to those with stable disease was three (range, one to 11 courses). The toxicity of the combination was limited principally to the hematopoietic system. Of 307 courses, 163 (53%) were associated with grade 3 or 4 neutropenia, 84 (27%) with grade 3 or 4 anemia, and 136 (44%) with grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia. Despite the severe myelosuppression, only 34 (11%) of 307 courses were associated with grade 3 or 4 infection. Nonhematopoietic toxicity of grades : 3 was rare and consisted of nausea and vomiting (two courses), perirectal mucositis (one course), transaminase elevation (one course), and hematuria (two courses). Conclusion: The combination of cyclophosphamide and topotecan is active in rhabdomyosarcoma, neuroblastoma, and Ewing's sarcoma. Stabilization of disease was seen in osteosarcoma, although objective responses were rare in this disease. The therapy can be given with acceptable hematopoietic toxicity with the use of filgrastim support.

Phytochemicals contained in root extracts of the plant species Echinacea purpurea are also potent as immune cell stimulants. Both agents are potent stimulants of T, B, and/or natural killer cells, but little is known of their effect on other hemopoietic cells, specifically granular leukocytes, also participants in a wide variety of disease defense processes. Given their current popularity and availability for amelioration of a) jet lag and sleep disorders (melatonin) and b) virus-mediated respiratory infections (E. purpurea), we investigated the effects of these agents on granular leukocytes and their precursors, myeloid cells. Mice received these agents daily for 7 or 14 days via the diet, thus mimicking human administration, after which spleens and bone marrow were removed and assessed for mature, differentiated granulocytes and their myeloid progenitors. The influence of these agents was directly related to the stage of cell maturity. Administration of both agents together resulted in significantly elevated levels of myeloid progenitor cells in both bone marrow and spleen and significantly reduced levels of mature, functional granulocyte progeny in both organs, suggesting a) increased precursor proliferation, b) anti-apoptosis among the progenitors, and/or c) inhibition of precursor maturation-the latter readily explaining the paucity of mature granulocyte progeny. In conclusion, individual administration of either the herbal derivative and melatonin was either without effect (E. purpurea) or even advantageous (melatonin) to cells of this lineage, but when administered together, these agents significantly perturbed myelopoiesis.

Experimental data and theoretical considerations indicate that transition metal cations may destabilize the ionic form of histidine residues within proteins, thereby decreasing their pK(a) values. Because the release of transition metal cations and acidification of the local environment represent important events associated with brain injury, the ability of Zn2+ and Cu2+ to bind to neurotrophins in acidic conditions may alter neuronal death following stroke or as a result of traumatic injury. To test the hypothesis that metal ion binding to neurotrophins is influenced by pH, the effects of Zn2+ and Cu2+ on NGF conformation, receptor binding and NGF tyrosine kinase (trkA) receptor signal transduction were examined under conditions mimicking cerebral acidosis (pH range 5.5-7.4). The inhibitory effect of Zn2+ on biological activities of NGF is lost under acidic conditions. Conversely, the binding of Cu2+ to NGF is relatively independent of pH changes within the studied range. These data demonstrate that Cu2+ has greater binding affinity to NGF than Zn2+ at reduced pH, consistent with the higher affinity Of Cu2+ for histidine residues. These findings suggest that cerebral acidosis associated with stroke or traumatic brain injury could neutralize the Zn2+-mediated inactivation of NGF, whereas corresponding pH changes would have little or no influence on the inhibitory effects of Cu2+. The importance of His84 of NGF for transition metal cation binding is demonstrated, confirming the involvement of this residue in metal ion coordination.

Treatment with pyrithiamine, a central thiamine antagonist, resulted in a 71 and 55% decrease in protein levels of the astrocyte glutamate transporters GLT-1 and GLAST, respectively, by immunoblotting in the medial thalamus of day 14 symptomatic rats at loss of righting reflexes. These changes occurred prior to the onset of convulsions and pannecrosis. Loss of both GLT-1 and GLAST transporter sites was also confirmed in this region of the thalamus at the symptomatic stage using immunohistochemical methods. In contrast, no change in either transporter protein was detected in the non-vulnerable frontal parietal cortex. These effects are selective; protein levels of the astrocyte GABA transporter GAT-3 were unaffected in the medial thalamus. In addition, astrocyte-specific glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) content was unchanged in this brain region, suggesting that astrocytes are spared in this disorder. Loss of GLT-1 or GLAST protein was not observed on day 12 of treatment, indicating that down-regulation of these transporters occurs within 48 h prior to loss of righting reflexes. Finally, GLT-1 content was positively correlated with levels of the neurofilament protein alpha -internexin, suggesting that early neuronal drop-out may contribute to the down-regulation of this glutamate transporter and subsequent pannecrosis. A selective, focal loss of GLT-1 and GLAST transporter proteins provides a rational explanation for the increase in interstitial glutamate levels, and may play a major role in the selective vulnerability of thalamic structures to thiamine deficiency-induced cell death.

To identify serotoninergic correlates of these altered behaviors, autoradiographic measurements of 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B serotonin (5-HT) receptors and transporter (5-HTT) were obtained using the radioligands [H-3]8-OH-DPAT, [I-125]cyanopindolol and [H-3]citalopram, respectively. By comparison to wild-type, density of 5-HT1B receptors was unchanged throughout brain in 5-HT1A KOs, and that of 5-HT1A receptors in 5-HT1B KOs. In contrast, decreases in density of 5-HTT binding were measured in several brain regions of both genotypes. Moreover, 5-HTT binding density was significantly increased in the amygdalo-hippocampal nucleus and ventral hippocampus of the 5-HT1B KOs. Measurements of 5-HT axon length and number of axon varicosities by quantitative 5-HT immunocytochemistry revealed proportional increases in the density of 5-HT innervation in these two regions of 5-HT1B KOs, whereas none of the decreases in 5-HTT binding sites were associated with any such changes. Several conclusions could be drawn from these results: (i) 5-HT1B receptors do not adapt in 5-HT1A KOs, nor do 5-HT1A receptors in 5-HT1B KOs. (ii) 5-HTT is down-regulated in several brain regions of 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B KO mice. (iii) This down-regulation could contribute to the anxious-like phenotype of the 5-HT1A KOs, by reducing 5-HT clearance in several territories of 5-HT innervation. (iv) The 5-HT hyperinnervation in the amygdalohippocampal nucleus and ventral hippocampus of 5-HT1B KOs could play a role in their increased aggressiveness, and might also explain their better performance in some cognitive tests. (v) These increases in density of 5-HT innervation provide the first evidence for a negative control of 5-HT neuron growth mediated by 5-HT1B receptors.

Mutations in the dystrophin gene lead to muscular dystrophy and mental retardation. In contrast to muscle, little is known about the localization and the molecular interactions of dystrophin and dystrophin associated proteins (DAPs) in brain. In the present study, we show that alpha -dystroglycan and dystrophin are localized to large neurones in cerebral cortex, hippocampus, cerebellum and spinal cord. Furthermore, we show that dystroglycan is a member of three distinct dystrophin-containing complexes. Two of these complexes contain syntrophin and both dystrophin and syntrophin are enriched in post-synaptic densities. These data suggest that dystrophin and DAPs may have a role in the organization of CNS synapses, Interestingly, the enrichment for syntrophin in post-synaptic densities is not affected in mice mutant for all dystrophin isoforms. Thus in the brain, unlike in muscle, the association of syntrophin with dystrophin is not crucial for the DAP complex which suggests that it may be associated with other proteins.

Little is known about the control of dopamine release in humans, but research in experimental animals suggests that the prefrontal cortex plays an important role in regulating the release of dopamine in subcortical structures. Here we used [C-11] raclopride and positron emission tomography to measure changes in extracellular dopamine concentration in vivo after repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in healthy human subjects. Repetitive TMS of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex caused a reduction in [C-11] raclopride binding in the left dorsal caudate nucleus compared with rTMS of the left occipital cortex. There were no changes in binding in the putamen, nucleus accumbens, or right caudate. This shows that rTMS of the prefrontal cortex induces the release of endogenous dopamine in the ipsilateral caudate nucleus. This finding has implications for the therapeutic and research use of rTMS in neurological and psychiatric disorders.

The goal of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of surgery for temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) in older (greater than or equal to 50 years of age) patients. Methods. The authors conducted a review of all patients 50 years of age or older with TLE surgically treated at the Montreal Neurological Institute and Hospital since 1981 by one surgeon (A.O.). Only patients without a mass lesion were included. Outcome parameters were compared with those of younger individuals with TLE, who were stratified by age at operation. In patients aged 50 years and older, the onset of complex partial seizures occurred 5 to 53 years (mean 35 years) prior to the time of surgery. Postoperatively, over a mean follow-up period of 64 months, 15 patients (83%) obtained a meaningful improvement, becoming either free from seizures or only experiencing a rare seizure. Most surgery outcomes were similar in both older and younger individuals, except for a trend to more freedom from seizures and increased likelihood of returning to work or usual activities in the younger patients. Note that a patient's long-standing seizure disorder did not negatively affect their ability to achieve freedom from seizures following surgery. Conclusions. Surgery for TLE appears to be effective for older individuals, comparing favorably with results in younger age groups, and carries a small risk of postoperative complications.

This result is due to the composition of the ventral sacral roots, which contain somatic fibers innervating the external urethral sphincter and preganglionic parasympathetic fibers innervating the detrusor, among others. The somatic fibers have a larger caliber than the parasympathetic fibers and, as large diameter fibers, need a lower stimulus amplitude for activation than smaller fibers. Activation of the smaller fibers is always accompanied by activation of the larger fibers. We studied the effect of chronic application of selective combined low and high frequency current stimulation of the ventral sacral root on bladder evacuation and urethral resistance in chronically spinalized (spinal cord transected above the spinal micturition center) male dogs for daily bladder evacuation. Materials and Methods: A total of 14 male mongrel dogs weighing 20 to 25 kg. underwent transection of the spinal cord at the T10 vertebra. The S2 ventral sacral root was wrapped with a bipolar electrode connected to a subcutaneous microstimulator. Daily bladder evacuation by neural stimulation with determination of the voided and residual urine volumes was done for 8 months. The animals were stimulated only with low frequency current during the 1-month spinal shock phase. Selective parameters of combined low frequency stimulation and high frequency blockade currents were subsequently applied for 6 months. For the last study month the animals were again stimulated by low frequency current alone. Bladder and urethral pressure as well, as electromyography of the external urethral sphincter and pelvic floor muscles were evaluated monthly. Histopathological testing of the chronically stimulated nerve and external sphincter was performed. Results: Of the 14 dogs 12 completed the followup study. During the shock phase with the application of low frequency only stimulation the animals voided 26% of mean functional bladder capacity with the early return of detrusor activity. Mean detrusor pressure plus or minus standard error of mean was 76.4 +/- 21.6 cm. water, while mean urethral pressure was 83.6 +/- 16.8 cm. water. During the application of selective combined low and high frequency stimulation 7 animals (58%) evacuated the bladder completely with post-void residual urine less than 10% of mean individual functional bladder capacity and 5 (42%) had mean post-void residual urine less than 20% of mean individual bladder capacity. Mean detrusor pressure was 73.5 +/- 20 cm. water and mean urethral pressure was 44 +/- 7.3 cm. water. There was a 45.19% reduction in the mean electromyography activity of the external sphincter. Stimulation of the dogs for the last month by low frequency current resulted in the voiding of 33% of mean bladder capacity with an increase in mean urethral pressure and electromyography activity. Conclusions: These results of reducing external sphincter activity by the simultaneous application of high frequency current blockade of the somatic fibers and activation of the autonomic fibers of the bladder by low frequency stimulation are promising.

A number of studies conducted in the frog Rana ridibunda have demonstrated that PACAP is widely distributed in the central nervous system (particularly in the hypothalamus and the median eminence) and in peripheral organs including the adrenal gland. The cDNAs encoding the PACAP precursor and 3 types of PACAP receptors have been cloned in amphibians and their distribution has been determined by in situ hybridization histochemistry. Ontogenetic studies have revealed that PACAP is expresssed early in the brain of tadpoles, soon after hatching.

We compared dopamine-stimulated adenylyl cyclase (AC) activity in homogenates of cerebral cortex (frontal, temporal, parietal, occipital and cingulate cortex) of autopsied brain of neurologically normal subjects to that in striatum. Cerebral cortical AC activity was modestly and dose-dependently stimulated by dopamine (maximal 20-30%) with low muM EC50s and such stimulation was inhibited by the selective dopamine D-1 receptor antagonist SCH23390. The magnitude of the maximal stimulation by dopamine was similar in autopsied and biopsied cerebral cortex. The extent of maximal stimulation was similar to that in dopamine-rich striatum (caudate, putamen and nucleus accumbens), despite much lower density of dopamine D-1 receptors in cerebral cortex vs. striatum. The EC50 for dopamine stimulation in cerebral cortex (similar to 1 muM) was lower than that for caudate and putarnen (similar to 3 muM). No detectable dopamine stimulation was observed in cerebellar cortex, thalamus or hippocampus. Dopamine stimulation in both cerebral cortex and striatum was independent of calcium activation. We conclude that dopamine stimulated AC can be measured in cerebral cortex of human brain allowing for the possibility that this process can be examined in human brain disorders in which dopaminergic abnormalities are suspected.

To examine whether similar effects occur in humans, we treated 98 subjects for 12 days with the serotonin precursor tryptophan (1g TID) and for 12 days with placebo in a double-blind, cross over study. Agreeableness/quarrelsomeness and dominance/submission were measured using an event-contingent method, in which subjects reported on various behaviors during important social interactions throughout their day. Tryptophan decreased quarrelsome behavior, but only when placebo was given first, suggesting that a decrease in quarrelsomeness when tryptophan was given first may have carried over into the subsequent placebo period. Tryptophan increased dominant behavior, an effect that was independent of the order of treatment, the broad social context, and the subject's and partner's sex. Our results suggest that serotonin may enhance dominance in humans, as in monkeys, and illustrate the advantages of the event contingent methodology in studying the associations between biology and human social interaction.

When the neurons are identical, we show how the symmetry of the system leads to the coexistence multiple, stable periodic orbits. As the coupling between the neurons is strengthened, these periodic orbits can undergo various bifurcations, leading to the coexistence of multiple, stable chaotic attractors. We show that this behaviour persists for near-identical neurons.

J	Shevell, MI; Peiffer, J				Shevell, MI; Peiffer, J			Julius Hallervorden's wartime activities: Implications for science under dictatorship	PEDIATRIC NEUROLOGY			English	Article								The eponym Hallervorden-Spatz syndrome recalls Julius Hallervorden's and Hugo Spatz's original description of this pediatric neurodegenerative disorder. Julius Hallervorden's important contribution to the practice of neuropathology over a long career cannot be underestimated. However, his work as a pathologist during the Third Reich put him in close proximity with the implementation of biologic solutions (i.e., euthanasia) targeting those individuals with significant intellectual or physical disabilities in chronic-care facilities. The Nazi program of active euthanasia provided a scientific opportunity to gain quick access to pathologic materials. This opportunity was recognized and used by Hallervorden to achieve personal scientific objectives and research efforts. These efforts resulted in a number of postwar scientific publications using materials obtained through the euthanasia program. The participation of distinguished academic physicians in such a program provides a cautionary tale of the potential results of ethical compromise and the effects of the abrogation of personal autonomy in the setting of a totalitarian dictatorship.

Full-spectrum fluorescent lighting (FSFL) has been credited with causing dramatic beneficial effects on a wide variety of behaviours, mental health outcomes and physical health effects, as compared to other fluorescent lamp types. These effects are hypothesized to occur because of similarity between FSFL emissions and daylight, which is said to have evolutionary superiority over other light sources. Method. This review, covering the period 1941-1999, critically considers the evidence for direct effects of FSFL through skin absorption as well as indirect effects on hormonal and neural processes. Conclusions. Overall, the evidence does not show dramatic effects of fluorescent lamp type on behaviour or health, neither does it support the evolutionary hypothesis.

NIRS has been applied to measure oxygenation in a variety of tissues including muscle, brain and connective tissue, and more recently it has been used in the clinical setting to assess circulatory and metabolic abnormalities. Quantitative measures of blood flow are also possible using NIRS and a light-absorbing tracer, which can be applied to evaluate circulatory responses to exercise along with the assessment of tissue O-2 saturation. The venular O-2 saturation can be estimated with NIRS by applying venous occlusion and measuring changes in oxygenated vs. total hemoglobin. These various measurements provide the opportunity to evaluate several important metabolic and circulatory patterns in very localized regions of tissue and may be fruitful in the study of occupational syndromes and a variety of diseases.

We hypothesized that the ERN only occurs with slips, that is unwilled action errors, but not if an error is committed willingly and intentionally. We investigated the occurrence of the ERN in a choice reaction time task that has been shown to produce an ERN and in an error simulation task where subjects had to fake errors while the EEG was recorded. We observed a loss of the ERN when errors were committed in willed actions but not in unwilled actions thus supporting the idea that the production of the ERN is tied to slips in unwilled actions but not mistakes in willed actions.

This formalism therefore puts the dynamics of neural networks within the framework of the laws of thermodynamics and thereby provides a mathematical basis to study neural dynamics as irreversible processes subjected to the thermodynamic principles. By using the minimal bromate oscillator, we apply the formalism of irreversible thermodynamics to study numerically the modes of energy dissipation related to logic operations. The calortropy of the system serves as an integral surface of the evolution equations for the concentrations of chemical species in the neurons of the network. It is shown that logic operations in the neural networks can be regarded as evolution of the states of neurons in the network toward the steady-state values of the calortropy production characteristic of the logic operations.

FRDA patients carrying two expanded GAA.TTC repeats show very low levels of mature frataxin mRNA and protein. A novel type of unusual DNA structure, sticky DNA, was previously found in the expanded GAA.TTC repeats from FRDA patients, To evaluate the effect of sticky DNA on transcription, in vitro transcription studies of (GAA.TTC), repeats (where n = 9-150) were carried out using T7 or SP6 RNA polymerase, When a gel-isolated sticky DNA template was transcribed, the amount of full-length RNA synthesized was significantly reduced compared with the transcription of the linear template, Surprisingly, transcriptional inhibition was observed not only for the sticky DNA template but also another DNA molecule used as an internal control in an orientation-independent manner. The molecular mechanism of transcriptional inhibition by sticky DNA was a sequestration of the RNA polymerases by direct binding to the complex DNA structure. Moreover, plasmids containing the (GAAGGA.TCCTTC)(65) repeat, which does not form sticky DNA, did not inhibit in vitro transcription, as expected. These results suggest that the role of sticky DNA in FRDA may be the sequestration of transcription factors.

An impairment of UA sensory function could therefore predispose to UA obstruction during sleep. We hypothesized that UA sensation is impaired in obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and that sensation improves after treatment with nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). We measured two-point discrimination (2PD) and vibratory sensation thresholds (VT) in 37 patients with OSA (mean [+/- SE] apnea-hypopnea index [AHI] = 39 +/- 5 events/h), 12 nonapneic snorers (SN), and 15 control subjects (CL). Sensory thresholds were determined in the UA and on the lip and hand as control sites. Both 2PD and VT were similar among the three groups at the lip and hand sites but were significantly reduced in the UA of OSA and SN subjects versus CL (p < 0.05). Values for 2PD and VT in the UA of OSA versus SN were not significantly different. Sensory measures were repeated after 6 mo in 23 OSA patients treated with CPAP as well as in 18 untreated patients. Thresholds for 2PD and VT at control sites remained identical in both groups, as did 2PD for the UA. However, VT in the UA showed a significant improvement in treated (4.4 +/- 0.2 pre-CPAP versus 3.8 +/- 0.2 mm post-CPAP, p < 0.05) but not untreated patients. These findings indicate the presence of a selective impairment in the detection of mechanical stimuli in the UA of patients with OSA and SN, which is partially reversible after treatment with nasal CPAP in patients with OSA.

Its sequence has been elucidated in many phyla and species. It shows high similarity among mammals, A Pro-Pro-Asn-Pro-Cys-Pro polyproline motif is its most conserved feature, being carried by both vertebrate and invertebrate sequences. It is biosynthesized as a precursor protein that is cleaved into an N-terminal fragment and a C-terminal peptide. In neuroendocrine cells, 7B2 functions as a specific chaperone for the proprotein convertase (PC) 2. Through the sequence around its Pro-Pro-Asn-Pro-Cys-Pro motif, it binds to an inactive proPC2 and facilitates its transport from the endoplasmic reticulum to later compartments of the secretory pathway where the zymogen is proteolytically matured and activated. Its C-terminal peptide can inhibit PC2 in vitro and may contribute to keep the enzyme transiently inactive in vivo. The PC2-7B2 model defines a new neuroendocrine paradigm whereby proteolytic activation of prohormones and proneuropeptides in the secretory pathway is spatially and temporally regulated by the dynamics of interactions between converting enzymes and their binding proteins. Interestingly, unlike PC2-null mice. which are viable, 7B2-null mutants die early in life from Cushings disease due to corticotropin ('ACTH') hypersecretion by the neurointermediate lobe, suggesting a possible involvement of 7B2 in secretory granule formation and in secretion regulation. The mechanism of this regulation is yet to be elucidated. 7B2 has been shown to be a good marker of several neuroendocrine cell dysfunctions in humans.

On each trial of the visual switching (VS) paradigm, subjects attended to one of two visual stimuli on the basis of either their color or shape. Trials were presented in blocks interleaved with cues instructing subjects to either continue attending to the currently relevant dimension or to switch to the other stimulus dimension. In the response switching (RS) paradigm, subjects made one of two manual responses to the single stimulus presented on each trial. The rules for stimulus-response mapping were reversed on different trials. Trials were presented in blocks interleaved with cues that instructed subjects to either switch stimulus-response mapping rules or to continue with the current rule. Brain activity at "switch" and "stay" events was compared. The results revealed distinct parietal areas concerned with visual attentional set shifts (VS) and visuomotor intentional set shifts (RS). In VS, activity was recorded in the lateral part of the intraparietal region. In RS, activity was recorded in the posterior medial intraparietal region and adjacent posterior superior and dorsomedial parietal cortex. The results also suggest that the basic functional organization of the intraparietal sulcus and surrounding regions is similar in both macaque and human species.

Correlation of torso scan and three-dimensional radiographic data in 65 scans of 40 subjects. Objectives. To assess whether full-torso surface laser scan images can be effectively used to estimate spinal deformity with the aid of an artificial neural network. Summary of Background Data. Ouantification of torso surface asymmetry may aid diagnosis and monitoring of scoliosis and thereby minimize the use of radiographs. Artificial neural networks are computing tools designed to relate input and output data when the form of the relation is unknown. Methods. A three-dimensional torso scan taken concurrently with a pair of radiographs was used to generate an integrated three-dimensional model of the spine and torso surface. Sixty-five scan-radiograph pairs were generated during 18 months in 40 patients (Cobb angles 0-58 degrees): 34 patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis and six with juvenile scoliosis. Sixteen (25%) were randomly selected for testing and the remainder (n = 49) used to train the artificial neural network. Contours were cut through the torso model at each vertebral level, and the line joining the centroids of a rea of the torso contours was generated. Lateral deviations and angles of curvature of this line, and the relative rotations of the principal axes of each contour were computed. Artificial neural network estimations of maximal computer Cobb angle were made. Results. Torso-spine correlations were generally weak (r < 0.5), although the range of torso rotation related moderately well to the maximal Cobb angle (r = 0.64). Deformity of the torso centroid line was minimal despite significant spinal deformity in the patients studied. Despite these limitations and the small data set, the artificial neural network estimated the maximal Cobb angle within 6<degrees> in 63% of the test data set and was able to distinguish a Cobb angle greater than 30 degrees with a sensitivity of 1.0 and specificity of 0.75. Conclusions. Neural-network analysis of full-torso scan imaging shows promise to accurately estimate scoliotic spinal deformity in a variety of patients.

In the current study, we have identified a new mSos-binding protein of 50 kDa (p50) that interacts with the mSos1 proline-rich domain. Mass spectrometry analysis and immunodepletion studies reveal p50 as PACSIN 1/syndapin I, a Src homology 3 domain-containing protein functioning in endocytosis and regulation of actin dynamics. In addition to PACSIN 1, which is neuron-specific, mSos also interacts with PACSIN 2, which is expressed in neuronal and nonneuronal tissues. PACSIN 2 shows enhanced binding to the mSos proline-rich domain in pull-down assays from brain extracts as compared with lung extracts, suggesting a tissue-specific regulation of the interaction. Proline to leucine mutations within the Src homology 3 domains of PACSIN 1 and 2 abolish their binding to mSos, demonstrating the specificity of the interactions. In situ, PACSIN 1 and mSos1 are co-expressed in growth cones and actin-rich filopodia in hippocampal and dorsal root ganglion neurons, and the two proteins coimmunoprecipitate from brain extracts. Moreover, epidermal growth factor treatment of COS-7 cells causes co-localization of PACSIN 1 and mSos1 in actin-rich membrane ruffles, and their interaction is regulated through epidermal growth factor-stimulated mSos1 phosphorylation, These data suggest that PACSINs may function with mSos1 in regulation of actin dynamics.

The present study aims at evaluating the sensitivity to spatial disparity of PMLS binocular cells in paralyzed and anesthetized Siamese cats. Centrally located receptive fields were mapped, separated using prisms and then stimulated simultaneously using two luminous bars optimally adjusted to the size of the excitatory receptive fields. Delays were introduced in the arrival of the luminous bars in the receptive fields so as to create the desired spatial disparities. Results indicate that approximately a third of PMLS units are binocular and that these binocular cells can detect spatial disparity cues. Indeed. although the sample was relatively small, cells of the tuned excitatory (14/34), tuned inhibitory (2/34), near (6/34) and far (1/34) types were identified. The spatial selectivity, as measured by the width at half height of the tuning curves of the excitatory and inhibitory cells and the slopes of the near and far cells, was similar to that obtained in PMLS of normal cats but not as precise as that found for primary visual areas in these animals. This suggests that these cells might serve as a substrate for coarse stereopsis. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Here we describe crawling forward in a narrow U-shaped tunnel. A rapid movement along the tunnel was evoked by stimulating the tail. The muscle activity responsible for propulsion was confined to the area around the body bend. Muscles on the inner (concave) side were activated when approaching the turn, and inactivated on the top of the are. Muscles on the outer (convex) side were co-active with their antagonists. but also active in the area of straightening of the body bend. This pattern of muscle activity propagated along the body. The role of central and reflex mechanisms in the generation of locomotor movements is discussed. NeuroReport 12:1803-1807 (C) 2001 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

Others report little or no difference between the orbicularis oculi and the adductor pollicis, These discrepancies could be related to the exact site of recording. The purpose of this study was to compare two monitoring sites around the eye with the adductor pollicis and the laryngeal adductor muscles, Methods: After institutional approval and informed consent, the evoked response to train-of-four stimulation was measured In 12 patients by acceleromyography at the thumb (adductor pollicis), the eyelid (orbicularis oculi), and the superciliary arch (corrugator supercilii) after 0.5 mg/kg rocuronium during propofol-fentanyl-nitrous oxide anesthesia. In 12 other patients, laryngeal adductor neuromuscular blockade was assessed via the cuff of the tracheal tube and compared with the adductor pollicis and the corrugator supercilii after 0.6 mg/kg rocuronium, Results: After 0.5 mg/kg, maximum blockade (%T1, mean +/- SD) was less at the corrugator supercilii (80 +/- 20%) than at the adductor pollicis (100 +/- 1%) and the orbicularis oculi (93 +/- 8%) (P < 0.01). Clinical duration (25%T1) was shorter at the corrugator supercilii (12 +/- 7 min) than at the adductor pollicis (25 +/- 4 min) and orbicularis oculi (24 +/- 10 min) (P < 0.01). After 0.6 mg/kg, maximum blockade was similar at the corrugator supercilii (88 +/- 8%) and the laryngeal adductor muscles (89 +/- 11%). Clinical duration at the corrugator supercilii and the laryngeal adductors was 17 +/- 7 and 17 +/- 10 min, respectively. Conclusions: Muscles around the eye vary in their response to rocuronium, The response of the superciliary arch (corrugator supercilii) reflects blockade of laryngeal adductor muscles. However, the eyelid (orbicularis oculi) and thumb (adductor pollicis) have similar sensitivities.

On one hand, some studies claim that language eventually resumes to normal, whereas, on the other hand, studies show lasting deficits throughout development. Discrepancies in the results could arise from different etiologies and tests used. This study attempts to determine the extent to which the development of verb production is affected in later development in children who had simple partial epilepsy (SPE). Measures of diversity and fluency of three verb types, namely main verbs, auxiliary and copula verbs, and nonfinite verbs were used on three children diagnosed as SPE and compared to control groups. Our main results show a limited production of auxiliary verbs. Further analysis of their productions suggest a telegraphic style of speech, as reflected by a superior production of nonfinite verb type compared with normal children. These findings are interpreted as reflecting long-lasting consequences of early brain damage with respect to language development. (C) 2001 Academic Press.

Over an 18-month period, all children less than 5 years of age referred to the ambulatory pediatric neurology or developmental pediatrics clinics of the Montreal Children's Hospital for initial evaluation of a suspected developmental delay were enrolled. Features evident on history or physical examination were determined at intake as were the laboratory tests land their rationale) requested by the evaluating physicians. Six months post initial assessment, detailed chart review was undertaken to determine if an etiology was found and the basis for such a determination. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression was used to test for associations between factors present at intake and successful ascertainment of an underlying etiology. Two hundred and twenty-four children met study criteria. Etiologic yield varied across childhood developmental delay subtypes, and was 44/80 for global developmental delay [GDD] (55%). 13/22 for motor delay [MD] (59.1%). 3/72 for developmental language disorders [DLD] (4.2%), and 1/50 for autistic spectrum disorders [ASD] (2%). For GDD, the presence of historical features or findings on physical examination was associated with greater likelihood for successful etiologic determination with the following items significant in multiple logistic regression analysis; microcephaly. antenatal toxin exposure, focal findings. For MD, physical findings or the co-existence of a cerebral palsy symptom complex predicted a successful search for etiology. For both groups, the severity of the delay did not predict etiologic yield. For both groups, a small number of etiologic categories accounted for the majority of diagnoses made. Etiologic yield in childhood developmental delay is largely dependent on the specific developmental delay subtype. Paradigms for systematic evaluation of this common child health problem can be suggested, however they await validation. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

In the current study, the authors evaluated late neuropsychologic effects 7 years after diagnosis and the long-term survival in a cohort of patients treated for high-risk childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) with cranial radiation therapy. Efficacy and toxicity were evaluated in relation to patient age at diagnosis (age < or <greater than or equal to> 36 months). METHODS. Two hundred and one patients treated for high-risk ALL on the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute Consortium Protocol 87-01 were included, 147 of whom were in continuous complete disease remission and were eligible for cognitive testing. Sixty-one patients consented to undergo testing. All patients received 18 grays (Gy) of cranial radiation as a component of central nervous system treatment. RESULTS. For all 201 patients, the 5-year overall survival (% +/- the standard error) was 82% +/- 2 and the 5-year event-free survival (% +/- the standard error) was 75% +/- 3. Only two patients developed a central nervous system recurrence. Intelligence quotient (IQ) and memory were at the expected mean for age, but performance on a complex figure drawing task was found to be reduced. Children who were age < 36 months at the time of diagnosis were found to have an IQ in the average range, but showed verbal deficits. CONCLUSIONS. The results of the current study demonstrate excellent efficacy of therapy and relatively limited late neurotoxicity on a childhood ALL therapy protocol in which all evaluated patients had received 18 Gy of cranial radiation. Efficacious therapy that includes cranial radiation does not appear to necessarily incur a heightened risk for significant cognitive impairment. Cancer 2001;92: 15-22.

The neurotrophins, a family of growth factors best known for their positive effects on neuronal biology, have now been shown to mediate both positive and negative survival signals, by signalling through the Trk and p75 neurotrophin receptors, respectively. The mechanisms whereby these two neurotrophin receptors interact to determine neuronal survival have been difficult to decipher, largely because both can signal independently or coincidentally, depending upon the cell or developmental context. Nonetheless, the past several years have seen significant advances in our understanding of this receptor signalling system. In this review, we focus on the proapoptotic actions of the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75(NTR)), and on the interplay between Trk and p75(NTR) that determines neuronal survival.

The rat organum vasculosum lamina terminalis (OVLT) contains GABA- and glutamate-releasing neurons that project directly to magnocellular neurosecretory cells (MNC) in the supraoptic nucleus. 2. Changes in osmolality over the OVLT in hypothalamic explants cause proportional changes in firing in MNC through corresponding changes in the frequency of spontaneous glutamatergic excitatory post-synaptic potentials without affecting GABAergic inhibitory post-synaptic potentials. 3. Exogenously applied atrial natriuretic peptide inhibits the osmotic control of MNC by causing a decrease in the amount of glutamate released provoked by action potentials originating from OVLT neurons.

In the past, pathophysiological understanding of this common condition has been extrapolated from studies of severe brain trauma. More recent scientific study demonstrates that this approach is unsatisfactory, and the clinical features of concussion represent a predominantly functional brain injury rather than manifest by structural or neuropathological damage. Such understanding of this condition remains incomplete at this stage.

Considering the fact that several ocular diseases are more prevalent among the elderly, it is increasingly important to investigate normal visual function in this subgroup of our population. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of advanced aging on visual retinocortical function by evaluating the electrophysiological responses of the most rapidly increasing segment of the geriatric population. Methods: Fifty-eight healthy subjects between the ages of 20-32 years (n = 30) and 75-88 years (n = 28) participated in this study. We recorded their pattern electroretinograms (ERGs) and cortical visual evoked potentials (VEPs) under stimulus conditions biased toward the preferential response of the magnocellular and parvocellular subdivisions of the visual system. Results: Elderly subjects showed reduced ERG amplitudes relative to young participants. The amplitude of the VEPs also decreased with age, while their latency increased. The effect of senescence was most apparent under stimulus conditions combining the magnocellular and parvocellular pathway contributions and less pronounced when the stimulus conditions were biased to favor the response of either system. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that visual retinal and cortical function deteriorates with old age. Our data further indicate that senescence has widespread effects on the visual system, altering the functioning of both the magnocellular and panvocellular Visual pathways.

This peptidase is involved in the post-secretory metabolism of various neuropeptides and peptide hormones in vivo, such as enkephalins, bradykinin, atrial natriuretic peptide, substance P and endothelins. In this paper we show that NEP is expressed in ovaries as a 110-kDa glycosylated integral membrane protein with enzymatic properties similar to those of the kidney protein. Using immunohistochemistry, we localize the peptidase in the granulosa cells of follicles at all stages of maturation, with the exception of atretic follicles. We also observe immunoreactive staining in the epithelia that lines the blood vessels in the medulla and the surface of the ovary. The co-localization of NEP and bioactive peptides known to be physiological substrates of NEP in other tissues suggests an important role for this protein in processes such as follicle maturation, ovulation, and/or regulation of ovarian blood flow, by modulating the physiological function of these peptides.

NADPH is an enzyme involved in the synthesis of NO, a mediator of smooth muscle relaxation in penile tissues. We euthanized 36 rats (age, 1 to 65 days) and obtained penile midshaft specimens for NADPH staining. The number of NADPH-positive granules in the corpus cavernosum and dorsal penile nerve increased significantly (P< 0.001) until animals were 50 days of age. Penile erections in young rats are known to occur around 30-40 days, and penile tissues showed a very significant (P < 0.001) increase of NADPH-positive granules in the corpus cavernosum and the dorsal penile nerve during this period. Therefore, NO seems important for the development of penile erection in juvenile rats.

This paper examines Piaget's views about two fundamental epistemological problems central to any theory of consciousness: (1) the general problem of the subject-object relationship in any type of knowing; and (2) the specific problem of the physical-mental relationship within the knowing subject. Piaget adopts a unique form of internal interactionism toward the first issue and a sophisticated form of parallelism toward the second; he aimed for an eventual integrative monism while providing compelling reasons why such a monism may always exist in name only. While his approach to these problems did not solve them, his examination of the problems - and his proposed coordination of philosophy, psychology, and neuroscience - is an important path toward consilience in the scientific study and understanding of consciousness.

Mice homozygous for a null allele of Sim1 (Sim1(-/-)) lack a PVN and die perinatally. In contrast, we show here that Sim1 heterozygous mice are viable but develop early-onset obesity, with increased linear growth, hyperinsulinemia and hyperleptinemia. Sim1(+/-) mice are hyperphagic but their energy expenditure is not decreased, distinguishing them from other mouse models of early-onset obesity such as deficiencies in leptin and melanocortin receptor 4. Quantitative histological comparison with normal littermates showed that the PVN of Sim1(+/-) mice contains on average 24% fewer cells without a selective loss of any identifiable major cell type. Since acquired lesions in the PVN also induce increased appetite without a decrease in energy expenditure, we propose that abnormalities of PVN development cause the obesity of Sim1(+/-) mice. Severe obesity was described recently in a patient with a balanced translocation disrupting SIM1. Pathways controlling the development of the PVN thus have the potential to cause obesity in both mice and humans.

The first one uses the network to make a forecast of asset behavior, in conjunction with a traditional mean-variance allocator for constructing the portfolio. The second paradigm uses the network to directly make the portfolio allocation decisions. We consider a method for performing soft input variable selection, and show its considerable utility, We use model combination (committee) methods to systematize the choice of hyperparemeters during training. We show that committees using both paradigms are significantly outperforming the benchmark market performance.

The bioaccumulation of Mn in different organs and tissues, the alteration of biochemical parameters, and the locomotor activity were assessed. A group of 26 male Sprague-Dawley rats (E) were exposed to 3750 mug/m(3) of Mn dust for 6 h/day, 5 days/wk for 13 consecutive weeks and compared to a control group of 12 rats (C) exposed to 4 mug/m(3). After exposure, neurological evaluation was carried out for 36 h ( a night-day-night cycle) using a computerized autotrack system. Rats were then sacrificed by exsanguination, and Mn content in organs and tissues was determined by neutron activation analysis. Mn concentrations in lung, putamen, and cerebellum were significantly higher in E than in C (0.30 vs. 0.17, 0.89 vs. 0.44, 0.63 vs. 0.48 ppm; p < .01), as well as in the kidney, frontal cortex, and globus pallidus ( 1.15 vs. 0.96, 0.84 vs. 0.47, 1.28 vs. 0.55 ppm; p < .05). Potassium concentration was significantly lower in E than in C (5.11 vs. 5.79 mmol/L; p < .05), as was alkaline phosphatase (106.9 vs. 129.6 U/L; p < .01). Locomotor activity indicated higher distance covered in the first 12-h period for E (45 383 vs. 36 098 cm; p < .05) and lower resting time in the last 12-h period for E ( 36 326 vs. 37 393 s; p < .05).

In the present study, MDRI P-gp was immunodetected by Western blot analysis in 60 human brain tumors, including meningiomas, schwannomas, low-grade gliomas (astrocytomas, pilocytic astrocytomas) and high-grade gliomas (anaplastic astrocytomas, glioblastomas and anaplastic oligodendrogliomas), Most samples from primary tumors expressed P-gp at the same levels as normal brain tissue except for schwannomas, in which levels were reduced by 65%, and meningiomas, in which levels were more than 10-fold higher in 7 of 10 samples. P-gp levels were 70% and 95% lower in brain metastases from melanomas and lung adenocarcinomas, respectively, than in normal brain tissue, These results indicate that the majority of primary brain tumors express MDRI P-gp and that its high expression levels in meningiomas may be a marker for this type of brain tumor.

Long-term lithium administration blunts G-protein coupled cAMP signaling and may regulate G(s)alpha levels. Methods: We measured G(s)alpha in transformed lymphoblasts obtained from subjects with bipolar disorder and compared the findings with 23 age- and sex-matched controls. To reduce patient heterogeneity, we included only patients with an excellent response to lithium prophylaxis. Results: We found no differences in G,cr protein levels measured with immunoblotting. G(s)alpha levels did not correlate with age, age of onset or duration of lithium therapy. Limitations: This study made use of transformed lymphoblasts, which may not fully represent changes that occur in regionalized brain tissue. Furthermore, the transformed lymphoblasts used in this study were acquired from a select group of bipolar disorder subjects that responded to lithium treatment. Lastly, consideration has to be given to the small sample size of the study. Conclusions: These results are consistent with recent observations suggesting that mood state and treatment effects may account at least in part for increased G,a levels in bipolar disorder. Clinical relevance: This study suggests a need to further characterize biological phenotypes in subjects with mood disorders to enhance genetic studies. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Machado-Joseph Disease shows non-Mendelian features typical of other triplet repeat disorders, including clinical heterogeneity, variable age at onset and anticipation. Three phenotypes have been proposed (clinical types 1, 2 and 3). Type 1 is associated with early age at onset and a high repeat number of the CAG sequence, and Types 2 and 3 have later onset and lower numbers of CAG repeats, This paper investigates whether there is selection against the MJD gene, acting through differential survival, nuptiality and fertility associated with clinical type and age at onset. The study sample comprised 40 MJD patients from the Azores (Portugal) having fully documented reproductive histories and known dates of death. The proportion of married patients of each clinical type increased from 0.22 among Type 1 patients, to 0.40 in Type 2 and 0.95 in Type 3, Age at onset and length of survival were also associated with marital status, with the married cases having later mean age at onset and longer mean survival time. In the whole sample, clinical type was associated with fertility, with significantly fewer children born to Type i patients. Among married patients clinical type was not associated with age at marriage, reproductive span or number of children. No reduction of fertility was detected among married patients in whom the onset of MJD was below the age of 50, The authors' interpretation of these results is that the high-repeat CAG haplotypes associated with early age at onset and clinical Type 1 are selected against through reduced survival and fertility. The Fertility component of selection is mediated by nuptiality rather than marital fertility.

Because these techniques use physiological responses such as increased perfusion or metabolism as surrogate indicators of evoked neuronal electrical activity, understanding the role of these processes in sustaining the information processing function of neurons is vital to the proper interpretation Of functional neuroimaging data. An ultimate goal of these non-invasive techniques is to approach the sensitivity and spatial resolution of earlier autoradiographic methods, which have repeatedly demonstrated exquisitely detailed delineations of neuronal response patterns using metabolic glucose uptake as a physiological tag. Although glucose is generally metabolized ill conjunction with oxygen, technical challenges in imaging tissue oxygen Consumption in vivo have limited the use of this complementary process in the detection of neuronal activation. In this article we review concepts linking cerebral blood flow and metabolism to neuronal activation, and compare functional imaging techniques that exploit these relationships. We also describe recently introduced MRI based methods for measurement of oxygen consumption and assess the relative contributions of different metabolic pathways during neuronal activation. Our calculations suggest that the bulk of the energy demand evoked during stimulation of neurons in visual cortex is met through Oxidative metabolism of glucose, supporting the use of oxygen uptake as a marker for increased neuronal electrical activity.

The association between perioperative electroencephalography (EEG) with acute neurologic status and subsequent outcome was examined in a cohort of 60 infants. Preoperative EEG and neurologic examinations were performed within 1 to 2 days prior to surgery (n = 27) and postoperatively (n = 47). Prior to surgery, 15 of 27 infants had normal EEG, whereas 5 had epileptiform activity and 9 had disturbances in background activity that were primarily moderate (8/9) and diffuse (7/9). Postoperatively, only 17 of 47 infants had normal recordings. Newborns (< 1 month) were more likely (P < .001) to demonstrate EEG abnormalities than infants. Epileptiform activity was documented in 15, whereas 28 had background abnormalities that were moderate-severe (22/28) and diffuse (20/28) in most. Epileptiform activity prior to surgery was always associated with an abnormal neurologic examination, and this association persisted postoperatively (86%). Moderate to severe background abnormalities in the postoperative EEG was also strongly associated with acute neurologic abnormalities (93%). Severe background abnormalities (n = 5) were 100% predictive of death or severe disability. Long-term follow-up revealed that all children with normal postoperative EEGs had positive neurologic outcomes (P = .04); however, there were many false positives. Perioperative EEG abnormalities increased the likelihood for acute neurologic findings, whereas normal recordings following surgery were reassuring with regard to a favorable outcome.

To address this question, all young children (under 5 years of age) referred for an initial assessment to ambulatory pediatric neurology or developmental pediatric clinics at a tertiary university center over an 18-month period for a suspected developmental delay were prospectively identified. Specific diagnostic testing was left to the discretion of the evaluating physician. In all, 50 children with an autistic spectrum disorder were assessed. Detailed history or physical examination was informative with respect to suggesting the possibility of an underlying etiology in a minority (10/50, 20%). Genetic studies (FMR-1, karyotype), electroencephalography (EEG), and neuroimaging were carried out in a majority (42/50, 34/50, and 33/50, respectively) of the children, for the most part on a screening rather than an indicated basis (31/42, 34/34, and 28/33, respectively). Etiologic yield was low (1/50, 2%), with only a single child identified with a possible Landau-Kleffner variant on sleep EEG tracing. The results suggest an evaluation paradigm with reference to etiologic determination for young children with autistic spectrum disorder that does not presently justify metabolic or neuroimaging on a screening basis. Recurrence risk and treatment implications, however, suggest that strong consideration be given to genetic (FMR-1, karyotype) testing and EEG study despite a relatively low yield.

The presence of attention deficit/hyperactivity in some SO children has previously been documented. This family history study used 27 SLI families, identified through the parents from the Dysphasia Association, to examine the relationship between attention deficit/hyperactivity in SLI children and the risk to first-degree relatives. All SLI children were clinically diagnosed with speech/language disorder; medical records were searched for the presence of any of the exclusion criteria noted above. The 13 SLI children with medical record of attention deficit/hyperactivity had a significantly higher chance of having first-degree relatives with speech/language disorders than 14 SLI children without such record (15/27 and 4/46, respectively). This preliminary report suggests that additional study is warranted to investigate the relationship between speech/language disorders and attention deficit/hyperactivity in families of SLI children. Learning outcomes: As a result of this activity, the participant will be able to describe the SLI phenotype, its prevalence, and complexity and to recognize the relationship between comorbid attention deficit/hyperactivity in SLI children and the risk of speech/language disorder in their relatives.

First, we compared the induction of Fos-like immunoreactivity (lir) in the supraoptic (SON) and paraventricular (PVN) nuclei and medial preoptic area (MPOA) after central oxytocin administration between nonlactating and lactating rats. Next, we investigated whether NO modulated Fos induction following central oxytocin administration using a nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor, N-(')-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME). Finally, to determine whether the effects of NOS inhibition on Fos induction would generalize to stimuli other than oxytocin, we compared Fos-lir in the SON and PVN of lactating and nonlactating rats following L-NAME and urethane administration. In the first two experiments, oxytocin (50 ng in 2 mul) or vehicle was administered into the third ventricle. L-NAME (50 mg/kg) was given by an intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection 30 min before oxytocin administration (experiment 2) or an i.p. injection of urethane (1.4 g/kg) (experiment 3). In all experiments, lactating rats were tested on day 12 or 13 postpartum and nonlactating females at least 11 days after surgery or the start of the experiment. Central oxytocin infusion induced Fos expression in the SON and PVN in lactating and nonlactating rats and in the MPOA and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis in lactating rats. Overall, lactating rats that received L-NAME and oxytocin had a greater number of cells showing Fos-lir in both the SON and PVN. Conversely, L-NAME administration reduced Fos-lir in the SON and PVN in oxytocin-stimulated nonlactating rats. In urethane-treated rats, L-NAME administration did not change Fos-lir in lactating rats but reduced Fos-lir in nonlactating rats. These data suggest that the role of NO in modulating the activity of neurones in discrete nuclei in the hypothalamus varies across reproductive state and with the stimulus presented.

J	Buss, RR; Drapeau, P				Buss, RR; Drapeau, P			Synaptic drive to motoneurons during fictive swimming in the developing zebrafish	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article							LAMPREY SPINAL-CORD; MESENCEPHALIC LOCOMOTOR REGION; CENTRAL PATTERN GENERATOR; AMINO-ACID RECEPTORS; MUSCLE-FIBERS; IDENTIFIED MOTONEURONS; BRACHYDANIO-RERIO; LARVAL ZEBRAFISH; NEURONAL NETWORK; RENSHAW CELLS	The development of swimming behavior and the correlated activity patterns recorded in motoneurons during fictive swimming in paralyzed zebrafish larvae were examined and compared. Larvae were studied from when they hatch (after 2 days) and are first capable of locomotion to when they are active swimmers capable of capturing prey (after 4 days). High-speed (500 Hz) video imaging was used to make a basic behavioral characterization of swimming. At hatching and up to day 3, the larvae swam infrequently and in an undirected fashion. They displayed sustained bursts of contractions ('burst swimming') at an average frequency of 60-70 Hz that lasted from several seconds to a minute in duration. By day 4 the swimming had matured to a more frequent and less erratic "beat-and-glide" mode, with slower (similar to 35 Hz) beats of contractions for similar to 200 ms alternating with glides that were twice as long, lasting from just a few cycles to several minutes overall. In whole cell current-clamp recordings, motoneurons displayed similar excitatory synaptic activity and firing patterns, corresponding to either fictive burst swimming (day 2-3) or beat-and-glide swimming (day 4). The resting potentials were similar at all stages (about -70 mV) and the motoneurons were depolarized (to about -40 mV) with generally non-overshooting action potentials during fictive swimming. The frequency of sustained inputs during fictive burst swimming and of repetitive inputs during fictive beat-and glide swimming corresponded to the behavioral contraction patterns. Fictive swimming activity patterns were eliminated by application of glutamate antagonists (kynurenic acid or 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxalene- 2,3-dione and DL-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid) and were modified but maintained in the presence of the glycinergic antagonist strychnine. The corresponding synaptic currents underlying the synaptic drive to motoneurons during fictive swimming could be isolated under voltage clamp and consisted of cationic [glutamatergic postsynaptic currents (PSCs)] and anionic inputs (glycinergic PSCs). Either sustained or interrupted patterns of PSCs were observed during fictive burst or beat-and-glide swimming, respectively. During beat-and-glide swimming, a tonic inward current and rhythmic glutamatergic PSCs (similar to 35 Hz) were observed. In contrast, bursts of glycinergic PSCs occurred at a higher frequency, resulting in a more tonic pattern with little evidence for synchronized activity. We conclude that a rhythmic glutamatergic synaptic drive underlies swimming and that a tonic, shunting glycinergic input acts to more closely match the membrane time constant to the fast synaptic drive.

We used positron emission tomography (PET) to indirectly measure pain-evoked cerebral activity before and after hypnotic suggestions were given to modulate the perceived intensity of a painful stimulus. These techniques were similar to those of a previous study in which we gave suggestions to modulate the perceived unpleasantness of a noxious stimulus. Ten volunteers were scanned while tonic warm and noxious heat stimuli were presented to the hand during four experimental conditions: alert control, hypnosis control, hypnotic suggestions for increased-pain intensity and hypnotic suggestions for decreased-pain intensity. As shown in previous brain imaging studies, noxious thermal stimuli presented during the alert and hypnosis-control conditions reliably activated contralateral structures, including primary somatosensory cortex (S1), secondary somatosensory cortex (S2), anterior cingulate cortex, and insular cortex. Hypnotic modulation of the intensity of the pain sensation led to significant changes in pain-evoked activity within S1 in contrast to our previous study in which specific modulation of pain unpleasantness (affect), independent of pain intensity, produced specific changes within the ACC. This double dissociation of cortical modulation indicates a relative specialization of the sensory and the classical limbic cortical areas in the processing of the sensory and affective dimensions of pain.

Their biographies provide only brief comments on their relationship without any thorough examination of their personal correspondence. In this article the Penfield-Cushing relationship is examined through an analysis of their unpublished personal letters. The Penfield-Cushing correspondence is a treasure for neurosurgery; it provides remarkable insight into the embryonic period of the discipline and into the relationship of two of the most influential figures in modern neurosurgery.

Methods: Dynamic PET scans were performed on 12 healthy volunteers after injection of (H2O)-O-15 in 2 conditions of baseline and visual stimulation. Calculation of rCBF was performed using the 2-weighted integral (WI) and autoradiographic methods for the I-compartment analysis, and the 3-WI method was followed for the 2-compartment analysis. Arterial blood radioactivity was counted continuously and corrected for delay and dispersion, The rCBF images were transformed into the Talairach space and analyzed by statistical parametric mapping to identify regional differences in the 2 methods. The values obtained from regions of interest also were compared. Results: Although the difference in global CBF between the 2 models was not significant, rCBF values in the large arteries and neighbor areas were significantly greater in the 2-WI method than in the 3-WI method. However, regional differences in the activation studies were not affected when the 2 methods were compared. The images of cerebral arterial blood volume (V,) obtained by the 3-WI method showed a significant increase in V, in the visual cortex during visual stimulation. Conclusion: These results suggest that the rCBF values in the I-compartment analysis were affected by radioactivity in the vessels. The 3-WI method could provide rCBF values that are less influenced by vascular radioactivity and also show differences in V, in PET activation studies.

In this study, we show that gabapentin (EC50 2 muM) inhibited up to 70 to 80% of the total K+-evoked Ca2+ influx via voltage-dependent calcium channels (VD-CCs) in a mouse pituitary intermediate melanotrope clonal mIL-tsA58 (mIL) cell line, mIL cells endogenously express only gamma -aminobutyric acid type B (GABA(B)) gb1a-gb2 receptors. Moreover, activity of the agonist gabapentin was dose dependently and completely blocked with the GABA(B) antagonist CGP55845 and was nearly identical to the prototypic GABA(B) agonist baclofen in both extent and potency. Antisense knockdown of gb1a also completely blocked gabapentin activity, while gb1b antisense and control oligonucleotides had no effect, indicating that gabapentin inhibition of membrane Ca2+ mobilization in mIL cells was dependent on a functional GABA(B) (gb1a-gb2) heterodimer receptor. In addition, during combined whole cell recording and multiphoton Ca2+ imaging in hippocampal neurons in situ, gabapentin significantly inhibited in a dose-dependent manner subthreshold soma depolarizations and Ca2+ responses evoked by somatic current injection. Furthermore, gabapentin almost completely blocked Ca2+ action potentials and Ca2+ responses elicited by suprathreshold current injection. However, larger current injection overcame this inhibition of Ca2+ action potentials suggesting that gabapentin did not predominantly affect L-type Ca2+ channels. The depressant effect of gabapentin on Ca2+ responses was coupled to the activation of neuronal GABA(B) receptors since they were blocked by CGP55845, and baclofen produced similar effects. Thus gabapentin activation of neuronal GABA(B) gb1a-gb2 receptors negatively coupled to VD-CCs can be a potentially important therapeutic mechanism of action of gabapentin that may be linked to inhibition of neurotransmitter release in some systems.

We describe a case of successful orthotopic liver transplantation in a 57-pear-old man with Laennec's cirrhosis using a liver containing an 8-cm focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH) lesion involving segments II and III and the caudate lobe. The donor liver was procured from a 46-year-old woman declared brain dead after a subarachnoid hemorrhage, Definitive pathological diagnosis was made at laparotomy by obtaining a Tru-cut (Allegiance Health Care Inc, Toronto, Ontario, Canada) core biopsy specimen. The recipient operation was performed uneventfully except for bleeding from the biopsy site. The patient did well postoperatively and was discharged on tacrolimus, mofetil mycophenolate, and prednisone therapy, He continues to thrive 2(1)/(2) years posttransplantation with no change in the size of the lesion. In well-selected donors,. FNH should not be a contraindication for use in transplantation, However, FNH must be differentiated from hepatocellular adenoma, Although FNH has a benign course with little propensity for bleeding and almost no malignant potential, hepatic adenoma is reported to have a 15% to 33% chance of bleeding and rupture with a well-documented potential for neoplastic degeneration, making the liver unsuitable for donation.

The etiology of NTDs is complex, with both genetic and environmental contributions; the genetic component has been extensively studied with mouse models(3). Loop-tail (Lp) is a semidominant mutation on mouse chromosome 1 (ref. 4). In the two known Lp alleles (Lp. Lp(m1Jus)), heterozygous mice exhibit a characteristic looped tail, and homozygous embryos show a completely open neural tube in the hindbrain and spinal region, a condition similar to the severe craniorachischisis defect in humans(4-6). Morphological and neural patterning studies indicate a role for the Lp gene product in controlling early morphogenesis and patterning of both axial midline structures and the developing neural plate(7). The 0.6-cM/0.7-megabase (Mb) Lp interval is delineated proximally by D1Mit113/Apoa2/Fcer1g and distally by Fcer1a/D1Mit149/Spna1 and contains a minimum of 17 transcription units(8-11). One of these genes, Ltap, encodes a homolog of Drosophila Strabismus/Van Gogh (Stbm/Vang), a component of the frizzled/dishevelled tissue polarity pathway(12-14). Ltap is expressed broadly in the neuroectoderm throughout early neurogenesis and is altered in two independent Lp alleles, identifying this gene as a strong candidate for Lp.

Our current objective was to assess whether the function of cells located more distally in the retina is also unaffected by the disease. We evaluated 23 individuals with early to moderate DAT and 23 healthy age-matched subjects. all displaying clinically normal visual function. Scotopic and photopic flash electroretinograms (fERGs) and oscillatory potentials (OPs) were recorded. The amplitude and latency of the retinal potentials did not differ between DAT and control subjects. Our current results showing normal fERGs and OPs in early DAT indicate that the underlying neurons giving rise to these signals are not impaired by the disease process. These data support and extend our recent findings suggesting that visual deficits in DAT do not stem from neuroretinal dysfunction. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science inc. All rights reserved.

The aim of the present study was to assess the role of expression of MKP-1 and phosphorylation status of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) in promoting cell survival in PC12 cells. We used FK506 and three different monoperoxovanadium complexes (mpVs) as pharmacological tools for manipulation of MKP-1 expression. Peroxovanadium compounds, known to be insulinomimetic agents and protein tyrosine phosphatase inhibitors, are cytotoxic to the cells, they activate JNK and down-regulate MPK-1. On the other hand, FK 506 has transient effect on ERK activation. However, when the agents are used in combination, ERK phosphorylation is prolonged and intensified, MKP-1 expression is increased, and cell survival is enhanced. The concomitant alterations observed in intensities and duration of phospho-ERKs and phospho-JNKs signals suggest that monoperoxovanadium complexes in combination with FK 506 enhance survival of PC12 cells by an induction of MKP-1 expression.

In the present study we examined, by in situ hybridization, the effects of pretreatment with the sst2-preferring SRIH analog, octreotide, in vivo, on mRNA levels of two SRIH receptor subtypes, sst1 and sst2, in rat brain and pituitary. I-125-[DTrp(8)]-SRIH binding was also measured in these regions. Three hours after the iv injection of 50 mug octreotide to conscious adult male rats, there was a 46% increase (p < 0.01) in the labeling density of sst2 mRNA-expressing cells in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus compared to normal saline-pretreated controls, but not in any of the other brain regions examined. Computer-assisted image analysis revealed that 3 h exposure to octreotide significantly (p < 0.01) augmented both the number and labeling density of sst2 mRNA-expressing cells in the arcuate nucleus, compared to those in saline-treated controls. By contrast, within the anterior pituitary gland, in vivo exposure to octreotide did not affect the expression of sst2 mRNA. No changes in sst1 mRNA-expressing cells were observed after octreotide treatment in any of the regions measured, indicating that the observed effects were homologous, i.e. specific of the receptor subtype stimulated. Octreotide pretreatment was also without effect on the density of I-125-[DTrp8]-SRIH binding in either the arcuate nucleus or pituitary. These results demonstrate, for the first time, that SRIH preexposure in vivo upregulates the expression of a subtype of its own receptors, sst2, within the central nervous system. They further suggest that pretreatment with SRIH in vivo does not cause sst2 receptor desensitization in arcuate nucleus and pituitary. Such homologous regulatory mechanisms may play an important role in the neuroendocrine control of growth hormone (GH) secretion by the arcuate nucleus. Copynght <(c)> 2001 S. Karger AG, Basel.

Its incidence is greatly increased among the socially disadvantaged, but the reasons for this excess are unclear and have been relatively unexplored. We hypothesise two distinct sets of causal pathways and mechanisms that may explain social disparities in preterm birth. The first set involves chronic and acute psychosocial stressors, psychological distress caused by those stressors, increased secretion of placental corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH), changes in sexual behaviours or enhanced susceptibility to bacterial vaginosis and chorioamnionitis, cigarette smoking or cocaine use, and decidual vasculopathy. The second hypothesised pathway is a gene-environment interaction based on a highly prevalent mutation in the gene for methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), combined with low folate intake from the diet and from prenatal vitamin supplements, consequent hyperhomocysteinemia, and decidual vasculopathy. We propose to test these hypothesised pathways and mechanisms in a nested case-control study within a prospectively recruited and followed cohort of pregnant women with singleton pregnancies who deliver at one of four Montreal hospitals that serve an ethnically and socio-economically diverse population. Following recruitment during the late first or early second trimester, participating women are seen at 24-26 weeks, when a research nurse obtains a detailed medical and obstetric history; administers several scales to assess chronic and acute stressors and psychological function; obtains blood samples for CRH, red blood cell and plasma folate, homocysteine, and DNA for the MTHFR mutation; and performs a digital and speculum examination to measure cervical length and vaginal pH and to obtain swabs for bacterial vaginosis and fetal fibronectin. After delivery, each case (delivery at < 37 completed weeks following spontaneous onset of labour or prelabour rupture of membranes) and two controls are selected for placental pathological examination, hair analysis of cotinine, cocaine, and benzoylecgonine, and analysis of stored blood and vaginal specimens. Statistical analysis will be based on multiple logistic regression and structural equation modelling, with sequential construction of models of potential aetiological determinants and covariates to test the hypothesised causal pathways and mechanisms. The research we propose should improve understanding of the factors and processes that mediate social disparities in preterm birth. This improved understanding should help not only in developing strategies to reduce the disparities but also in suggesting preventive interventions applicable across the entire socioeconomic spectrum.

Although tacrolimus may be a better immunosuppressant than cyclosporine, its neurological side effects may be worse. Two children, living-related kidney trans plant recipients, were treated with antibody induction, mycophenolate mofetil, prednisone, and tacrolimus. Soon after transplant, they each developed an encephalopathy, which when visualized by magnetic resonance imaging showed that it affected both white and grey matter of the brain. Although the encephalopathy was associated with the use of tacrolimus, there was a complete neurological recovery without cessation of the drug.

This study assessed the influence of nldr1a P-glycoprotein (P-gp) gene disruption, gender and concentration on initial brain uptake clearance (Cl-up) of morphine, quinidine and verapamil. Methods. Cl-up of radiolabeled substrates was determined in P-gp-competent and deficient [mdrla(-/-)] mice by in situ brain perfusion. Brain:plasma distribution of substrates after i.v. administration was determined in both strains. Results, Genetic disruption of mdrla P-gp resulted in 1.3-, 6.6- and 14-fold increases in Cl-up for morphine, verapamil and quinidine, respectively. With the exception of small differences for verapamil, gender did not affect Cl-up. Saturable transport of verapamil and quinidine was observed only in P-gp-competent mice, with apparent IC50 values for efflux of 8.6 +/- 2.3 muM and 36 +/- 2 muM, respectively. Verapamil Cl-up was similar to 50% higher in mdrla(+/-) vs. mdrla(+/+) mice: no such difference was observed for quinidine. In P-gp-competent mice, uptake of verapamil and quinidine was unaffected by organic vehicles. Plasma decreased VER Cl-up to a greater extent in the presence of P-gp. The influence of P-gp in situ was lower than, but correlated with, the effect in vivo. Conclusions. P-gp decreases Cl-up of morphine, verapamil and quinidine in situ with little or no influence of gender, but this effect cannot fully account for the effects of P-gp in vivo. P-gp is the only saturable transport mechanism for verapamil and quinidine at the murine blood-brain barrier. The influence of protein binding on Cl-up may be enhanced by P-gp-mediated efflux.

The purpose of this study was to determine whether the motor coordination deficits of Lurcher mutants could be improved after chronic administration of the serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) precursor, L-tryptophan, or of the 5-HT1A agonist, buspirone. During these treatments, the mice were submitted to behavioral evaluations using the coat hanger and the rotorod tests, as well as an inclined screen and a vertical grid test. At the end of treatments, 5-HT and 5-hydroxindole-3-acetic acid (5-HIAA) were measured in six brain regions. On the coat hanger test, administration Of L-tryptophan accelerated movements along the horizontal bar by 44%, while buspirone increased the time spent on the apparatus by 11%. Neither drug had an effect on climbing ability or on the time spent on a rotating beam. Administration of L-tryptophan increased 5-HIAA levels in frontal cortex, neostriatum, thalamus, brainstem, cerebellum and spinal cord, but elevated 5-HT only in neostriatum, brainstem and cerebellum. In contrast, buspirone led to 5-HT increases in cerebellum and augmented 5-HIAA in the spinal cord. The modest test-specific improvements are consistent with some of the clinical data concerning 5-HT pharmacotherapy in patients suffering from cerebellar atrophy. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.

Here we examine the copulatory components that comprise the unconditioned stimulus (UCS). In Experiment 1, male Long-Evans rats were allowed to copulate with scented females for nine sessions in which they achieved two ejaculations, one ejaculation plus the first intromission following the postejaculatory interval (PEI), one ejaculation without a PEI, or five intromissions without ejaculation. Only the males that achieved two ejaculations or one ejaculation plus the PEI displayed significant CEP. In Experiment 2, males were allowed to remain in the presence of the scented female without access to her after different amounts of copulatory stimulation. Under these conditions, both one and two ejaculations, but not five intromissions, supported the development of CEPs. In Experiment 3, males were allowed to copulate to ejaculation with an unscented female followed by exposure without access to a scented female. This treatment also supported the development of CEP. These results indicate that ejaculation plus a PEI are necessary for the development of CEPs and that the female must be present during the PEI for this to occur. These findings indicate that events during the PEI are the critical components of the UCS for CEP development. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

A prospective double-blind randomized controlled trial was performed. Objective. To assess the efficacy of percutaneous radiofrequency articular facet denervation for low back. Summary of Background Data. Uncontrolled observational studies in patients with low back pain have rer:a ported some benefits from the use of facet joint radiofrequency denervation. Because the efficacy of percutaneous radiofrequency had not been clearly shown in previous studies, a randomized controlled trial was conducted to assess the efficacy of the technique for improving proving functional disabilities and reduce pain, Methods. For this study, 70 patients with low back pain lasting of more than 3 months duration and a good response after intraarticular facet injections under fluoroscopy were assigned randomly to receive percutaneous radiofrequency articular facet denervation under fluoroscopic guidance or the same procedure without effective denervation (sham therapy). The primary outcomes were functional disabilities, as assessed by the Oswestry and Roland-Morris scales, and pain indicated on a visual analog scale. Secondary outcomes included spinal mobility and strength. Results. At 4 weeks, the Roland-Morris score had improved by a mean of 8.4% in the neurotomy group and 2.2% in the placebo group, showing a treatment effect of 6.2% (P = 0.05). At 4 weeks, no significant treatment effect was reflected in the Oswestry score (0.6% change) or the visual analog pain score (4.2% change). At 12 weeks, neither functional disability, as assessed by the Roland-Morris scale (2.6% change) and Oswestry scale (1.9% change), nor the pain level, as assessed by the visual analog scale (-7.6% change), showed any treatment effect. Conclusions. Although radiofrequency facet joint denervation may provide some short-term improvement in functional disability among patients with chronic low back pain, the efficacy of this treatment has not been established.

Previous animal studies showed that radiolabeled metabolites (radiometabolites) of [F-18]altanserin crossed the blood-brain barrier (BBB) to localize nonspecifically in brain, consistent with a constant radioactivity "background." In this work, we evaluated human bolus injection [F-18]altanserin PET data with detailed consideration of the impact of BBB-permeable metabolites on the specific binding parameters. Data were quantified using either single (parent radiotracer), dual (parent radiotracer and radiometabolites), or no arterial input function(s) (cerebellum as reference tissue input function). A step-gradient high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis provided distinct separation of [F-18]altanserin and four radiolabeled components in plasma. After [F-18]altanserin injection, the step-gradient data showed that the major BBB-permeable radiometabolites approached constant levels in plasma (>50 min), consistent with a constant metabolite "background." The single-input Logan graphical results were highly correlated with the dual-input results and its bias was fairly constant across regions and subjects, as similarly observed for a nongraphical reference tissue method. The most comprehensive and quantitatively valid analysis for bolus [F-18]altanserin PET data was the dual-input method that specifically accounted for BBB-permeable metabolites, although the Logan analysis was preferred because it provided a good compromise between validity, sensitivity, and reliability of implementation. Further study is needed to better understand how the cerebellar kinetics of [F-18] altanserin and its radiometabolites impact the reference tissue measures.

Although the modulation of GABA(A) receptors received much attention in hippocampal pyramidal cells, information is scarce regarding the pharmacology of these receptors in inhibitory interneurons. We investigated the pharmacological properties of GABA(A)-mediated miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs) using whole-cell voltage clamp recordings in two morphologically identified types of hippocampal CA1 interneurons, horizontal and vertical cells of stratum oriens-alveus. The negative modulators zinc (200 muM) and furosemide (600 muM) significantly decreased the amplitude of mIPSCs. Benzodiazepine agonists also produced significant effects: 10 muM zolpidem increased the amplitude, rise time, and decay time constant (decay tau) of mIPSCs, whereas 10 muM flunitrazepam affected similarly the amplitude and decay tau, but not the rise time. The neurosteroid allopregnanolone (10 muM) prolonged the decay tau of mIPSCs. Since these modulators act on different GABA(A) receptor subunits, this pharmacological profile suggests that GABA(A) receptors at spontaneously active inhibitory synapses onto vertical and horizontal interneurons are heterogeneous and formed by coassembly of different combinations of subunits (alpha (1-5)beta (1-3)gamma (1-3)). Furthermore, these synaptic GABA(A) receptors appear in large part pharmacologically similar to those of pyramidal cells. Synapse 41:29-39, 2001. (C) 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

In the immobile hindlimbs of the newborn, which comprise cartilaginous bones and loose, unstriated myofibers, scant immunolabeled nerve segments and small spherical terminals, presumably growth cones or immature neuromuscular junctions, are found in the muscle tissue of the thigh, lea and proximal foot, decreasing in number and size proximodistally. When the hindlimbs start moving at I week, terminals are more numerous and larger, still decreasing proximodistally, and occur in the newly formed interosseous foot muscles. At 4 weeks, when the hindlimbs start supporting weight and quadrupedal locomotion appears, terminals are more numerous, flattened and in comparable size and density in thigh, leg and foot muscles. By 7 weeks, large and completely flat terminals are observed in groups of 3 to 4 at regular intervals along muscle fibers. VAChT expression develops largely postnatally in the opossum hindlimbs, along a proximodistal gradient that parallels somatic and reflex development. (C) 2001 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

This activation is caused by phosphorylation of I-2 on Thr(72) by glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3). We have found that PP1 LB in bovine brain extract is also activated upon preincubation with ATP/Mg. However, blocking GSK3 action by LiCl inhibited only similar to 29% of PP1 activity and indicated that GSI(3 is not the sole PP1 .I-2 activator in the brain. When bovine brain extract was analyzed by gel filtration PPI .I-2 and neuronal CdcS-like protein kinase (NCLK), a heterodimer of Cdk5 and the regulatory p25 subunit, co-eluted as a similar to 450-kDa size species. The NCLK. from the eluted column fractions bound to PP1-specific microcystin-Sepharose and glutathione S-transferase (GST)-I-2-coated glutathione-agarose beads. Similarly, PPI from the eluted column fractions was pulled down with GST-Cdk5-coated glutathione-agarose beads. In vitro, NCLK( phosphorylated I-2 on Thr72 and activated PPI I-S in an ATP/Mg-dependent manner. NCLK bound to PP1 through its CdkS subunit and the PP1 binding region was localized to CdkS residues 28-41. Our data demonstrate that in brain extract PP1 .I-2 and NCLK are associated within a complex of similar to 450 kDa and suggest that NCLK is one of the PPI I-8-activating kinases in the mammalian brain.

J	Pagano, M; Anand-Srivastava, MB				Pagano, M; Anand-Srivastava, MB			Cytoplasmic domain of natriuretic peptide receptor C constitutes G(i) activator sequences that inhibit adenylyl cyclase activity	JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							NUCLEOTIDE REGULATORY PROTEIN; SIGNAL-TRANSDUCTION SYSTEM; GUANYLATE-CYCLASE; CLEARANCE RECEPTOR; SMOOTH-MUSCLE; PORCINE BRAIN; CYCLIC-GMP; NPR-C; ATRIAL; CELLS	We have recently demonstrated that a 37-amino acid peptide corresponding to the cytoplasmic domain of the natriuretic peptide receptor C (NPR-C) inhibited adenylyl cyclase activity via pertussis toxin (PT)-sensitive G(i) protein. In the present studies, we have used seven different peptide fragments of the cytoplasmic domain of the NPR-C receptor with complete, partial, or no G(i) activator sequence to examine their effects on adenylyl cyclase activity. The peptides used were KKYRITIER-RNH (peptide 1), RRNHQEESNIGK (peptide 2), HRELREDSIRSH (peptide 3), RRNHQEESNIGKHRELR (peptide 4), QEESNIGK (peptide X), ITIERRNH (peptide Y), and ITYKRRNHRE (peptide Z). Peptides 1, 3, and 4 have complete G(i) activator sequences, whereas peptides 2 and Y have partial G(i) activator sequences with truncated carboxyl or amino terminus, respectively. Peptide X has no structural specificity, whereas peptide Z is the scrambled peptide control for peptide 1. Peptides 1, 3, and 4 inhibited adenylyl cyclase activity in a concentration-dependent manner with apparent K-i between 0.1 and 1 nm; however, peptide 2 inhibited adenylyl cyclase activity with a higher K-i of about 10 nM, and peptides X, Y, and Z were unable to inhibit adenylyl cyclase activity. The maximal inhibitions observed were between 30 and 40%. The inhibition of adenylyl cyclase activity by peptides 1-4 was absolutely dependent on the presence of guanine nucleotides and was completely attenuated by PT treatment. In addition, the stimulatory effects of isoproterenol, glucagon, and forskolin on adenylyl cyclase activity were inhibited to different degrees by these peptides. These results suggest that the small peptide fragments of the cytoplasmic domain of the NPR-C receptor containing 12 or 17 amino acids were sufficient to inhibit adenylyl cyclase activity through a PT-sensitive G(i) protein. The peptides having complete structural specificity of G(i) activator sequences at both amino and carboxyl termini were more potent to inhibit adenylyl cyclase activity as compared with the peptides having a truncated carboxyl terminus, whereas the truncation of the amino-terminal motif completely attenuates adenylyl cyclase inhibition.

Homozygous mutant mice exhibit muscle wasting and neurodegeneration, resulting in death around postnatal day 28. eEF1A-2/S1 protein shares 92% identity with eEF1A-1; because specific antibodies for each were not available previously, it was difficult to study the developmental expression patterns of these two peptide elongation factors IA in wasted and wild-type mice. We generated a peptide derived antiserum that recognizes the eEF1A-2/S1 isoform and does not cross-react with eEF1A-1, We characterized the expression profiles of eEF1A-1 and eEF1A-2/S1 during development in wild type (+/+), heterozygous (+/wst), and homozygous (wst/wst) mice. In wild-type and heterozygous animals, eEF1A-2/S1 protein is present only in brain, heart, and muscle; the onset of its expression coincides with a concomitant decrease in the eEF1A-1 protein level, In wasted mutant tissues, even though eEE1A-2/S1 protein is absent, the scheduled decline of eEF1A-1 occurs nonetheless during postnatal development, as it does in wild-type counterparts. In the brain of adult wild-type mice, the eEF1A-2/S1 isoform is localized in neurons, whereas eEF1A-1 is found in non-neuronal cells. In neurons prior to postnatal day 7, eEF1A-1 is the major isoform, but it is later replaced by eEF1A-2/S1, which by postnatal day 14 is the only isoform present, The postdevelopmental appearance of eEF1A-2/S1 protein and the decline in eEF1A-1 expression in brain, heart, and muscle suggest that eEF1A-2/S1 is the adult form of peptide elongation factor, whereas its sister is the embryonic isoform, in these tissues. The absence of eEF1A-2/S1, as well as the on-schedule development-dependent disappearance of its sister gene, eEF1A, in wst/wst mice may result in loss of protein synthesis ability, which may account for the numerous defects and ultimate fatality seen in these mice.

J	Roux, PP; Bhakar, AL; Kennedy, TE; Barker, PA				Roux, PP; Bhakar, AL; Kennedy, TE; Barker, PA			The p75 neurotrophin receptor activates Akt (protein kinase B) through a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent pathway	JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							NERVE GROWTH-FACTOR; NF-KAPPA-B; ZINC-FINGER PROTEIN; CELL-DEATH; SIGNAL-TRANSDUCTION; NEURONAL APOPTOSIS; FACTOR-BINDING; SPHINGOMYELIN HYDROLYSIS; INTRACELLULAR DOMAIN; SURVIVAL SIGNALS	The Akt kinase plays a crucial role in supporting Trk-dependent cell survival, whereas the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR) facilitates cellular apoptosis. The precise mechanism that p75NTR uses to promote cell death is not certain, but one possibility is that p75NTR-dependent ceramide accumulation inhibits phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase mediated Akt activation. To test this hypothesis, we developed a system for examining p75NTR-dependent apoptosis and determined the effect of p75NTR on Akt activation. Surprisingly, p75NTR increased, rather than decreased, Akt phosphorylation in a variety of cell types, including human Niemann-Pick fibroblasts, which lack acidic sphingomyelinase activity. The p75NTR expression level required to elicit Akt phosphorylation was much lower than that required to activate the JNK pathway or to mediate apoptosis. Fire show that p75NTR dependent Akt phosphorylation was independent of TrkA signaling, required active phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and was associated with increased tyrosine phosphorylation of p85 and She and with reduced cytosolic tyrosine phosphatase activity. Finally, we show that p75NTR expression increased sur vival in cells exposed to staurosporine or subjected to serum withdrawal. These findings indicate that p75NTR facilitates cell survival through novel signaling cascades that result in Akt activation.

Hydrophilic agents often internalize poorly and slowly, and highly lipophilic ones too rapidly. The incorporation of drugs into micelles allows regulation of their internalization parameters, and newly-described block copolymers can be selectively tailored to suit specific drugs. This report compares internalization of Cell Tracker CM-DiI (DiI), a highly lipophilic non-cytotoxic fluorescent probe in common use in biology, from the freely-presented (non-micelle-incorporated) and micelle-incorporated states. DiI was effectively incorporated (> 60%) into 25-50 nm diameter spherical micelles made from polycaprolactone-b-polyethylene oxide block copolymer. Confocal microscopy was used to evaluate the internalization of DiI into mixed neuron-glia cultures (2-14 days in vitro, 2DIV-14DIV). Incorporation of DiI into micelles strikingly reduced the rate and extent of its internalization in both 2DIV and 14DIV cultures. Both the age of the cultures and the block copolymer employed to construct the micelles significantly influence the internalization of micelle-incorporated probe. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

TgCRND8 mice encode a double mutant form of amyloid precursor protein 695 (KM670/671NL+V717F) under the control of the PrP gene promoter. Thioflavine S-positive AP amyloid deposits are present at 3 months, with dense-cored plaques and neuritic pathology evident from 5 months of age. TgCRND8 mice exhibit 3,200-4,600 pmol of A beta 42 per g brain at age 6 months, with an excess of A beta 42 over A beta 40. High level production of the pathogenic A beta 42 form of A beta peptide was associated with an early impairment in TgCRND8 mice in acquisition and learning reversal in the reference memory version of the Morris water maze, present by 3 months of age. Notably, learning impairment in young mice was offset by immunization against A beta 42 (Janus, C., Pearson, J., McLaurin, J., Mathews, P. M., Jiang, Y., Schmidt, S. D., Chishti, M. A., Horne, P., Heslin, D., French, J., Mount, H. T. J., Nixon, R. A., Mercken, M., Bergeron, C., Fraser, P. E., St. George-Hyslop, P., and Westaway, D. (2000) Nature 408, 979-982). Amyloid deposition in TgCRND8 mice was enhanced by the expression of presenilin 1 transgenes including familial Alzheimer's disease mutations; for mice also expressing a M146L+L286V presenilin 1 transgene, amyloid deposits were apparent by 1 month of age. The Tg mice described here suggest a potential to investigate aspects of Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis, prophylaxis, and therapy within short time frames.

To increase the sensitivity of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for the detection of subtle lesions of FCD,we developed voxel-based image postprocessing methods, including first-order texture analysis and morphological processing modeled on known MRI features of FCD. We selected 16 patients with histologically proven FCD. Image processing features were calculated over a neighborhood for each voxel in the three-dimensional T1-weighted MRI. Three feature maps were generated: (1) gray matter thickness map to model cortical thickening, (2) gradient map to model blurring of the gray matter-white matter junction, and (3) relative intensity map to model the hyperintense signal within the lesion. Two observers detected lesions on conventional MRI in 8/16 and on ratio maps in 14/16 patients. Sensitivity was 87.5% (14/16) for the ratio maps compared to 50% (8/16) for MRI (p < 0.003). Specificity was 95% (19/20) for ratio maps and 100% (20/20) for MRIs. Cohen's kappa was 0.53 for MRIs, indicating moderate agreement, and 0.83 for ratio maps, indicating strong agreement beyond chance between the 2 observers. The image-processing methods developed in this study improve visual detection of FCD, even in cases where no lesion is obvious on MRI. These techniques could increase the number of patients with partial epilepsy who could benefit from surgery.

"Disorganization" correlates with the ability to inhibit proactive interference, thus with ventromedial frontal dysfunction. The results also add support to the view that the "pspchotic" dimension described in three-dimension models includes in fact two distinct dimensions, (1) ''hallucinations," ht l e associated to episodic memory measures, and (2) "delusions", here associated to visuospatial attention, thus suggestive of mediotemporal and posterior neocortical dysfunction, respectively.

Listeners had to focus on one component of the song at a time (text or. music) and had to decide whether the component was familiar or unfamiliar. Songs were either matched (i.e, an original familiar or an original unfamiliar song) or mismatched (a combination of a Familiar component with an unfamiliar one). Normal listeners displayed response patterns that are congruent with those obtained previously in different experimental settings and which showed that text and tune are difficult to separate. Data collected in the patient, however, suggest some independence between text and music in songs. Moreover, the usual asymmetry in favor of text was much reduced when later verses were used. Overall, the results are interpreted as revealing strong association, not integration, between the musical and the verbal component of Familiar songs. (C) 2001 Academic Press.

This case study is especially challenging since the child, whose phonological skills were quire efficient and who exhibited a dichotic listening unilateral extinction, had developed average reading and spelling abilities. The fact that B.E.'s performance on memory tasks was quite poor when the stimuli were presented auditorily and more efficient when the stimuli were presented visually, strongly suggests that the observed memory impairment was due to a deficit at the level of cortical auditory processing. B.E.'s phonological sh;ills were efficient, suggesting a neuropsychological dissociation between phonological ability and auditory processing. The fact that B.E. dramatically recovered language and easily acquired reading and spelling accounts for the hypothesis that compensatory strategies allowed him to develop phonological skills From predominantly visual input.

In fact, intrusions are common in many neurological degenerative diseases. The goal of the present study was to examine the types of intrusions made by three groups of patients, namely patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), and dementia with prominent frontal lobe semiology (FD). Although PD patients learned more words (trials 1 to 5 on the RAVLT) than the two other groups, there was no significant difference in the total number of intrusions. However, significant differences between groups were observed for nonrelated intrusions, the proportion of PD patients (15.48) being lower than the proportion of AD (45.5%) and FD (45.8%) patients with this type of intrusions. No other type of intrusions (same category, recurring, phonemic) significantly differentiated between the three groups. The proactive interference effect (PI), measured as the difference between first recall of list A and list B recall, was stronger in PD than in the two other groups, reflecting the strong positive correlation between total number of words recalled on the RAVLT and severity of the PI effect. Frier list intrusions (intrusions from list A while recalling list B items) were significantly more pronounced in FD than in the two other groups. Finally, free associations (series of intrusions related to one another but not to the target items) were observed almost exclusively in FD patients. Three findings illustrate some qualitative differences between various neurological degenerative diseases. They also stress the marked similarities between AD and FD with regards to verbal learning.

Within the framework of the study of phonological processing of words, manipulating the grapheme-phoneme transparency of stimuli can represent a means of counteracting the methodological drawbacks inherent to the subtraction paradigm. Thus, the purpose of this study was to determine the effect of the level of difficulty of grapheme-phoneme matching on the processing of transparent and nontransparent words. Grapheme-phoneme matching was carried out both on the final syllable of words and on sublexical segments within the word. The results indicate that processing is faster for the transparent than for the nontransparent stimuli. This task will now have to he reintroduced in brain imaging studies aiming to look at different levels of difficulty for grapheme-phoneme matching. (C) 2001 Academic Press.

Both types of lesions are characterized by induction of TNF synthesis in resident microglial cells, which in the ischemic lesions are supplemented by TNF synthesizing, blood-borne macrophages. In situ hybridization for TNF mRNA is performed using alkaline phosphatase-labelled oligodeoxynucleotide probes. These probes show excellent rendition of individual cells, and can successfully be combined with immunohistochemical procedures. We also describe a sensitive immunohistochemical method for detection of TNF, which can be combined with visualization of an additional antigen. The specificity of the histological procedures are confirmed by RT-PCR and Western blot analysis on homogenates prepared from microdissected brain regions. Advantages and disadvantages of;he methods are discussed with emphasis on the specificity and sensitivity of the histological procedures, Our strategy for detection of TNF mRNA and protein provides a solid basis for clarifying the cellular synthesis, regulation and function of TNF in the normal, injured or diseased CNS. Furthermore, the methodology can readily be applied in studies of other cytokines and growth factors in the CNS. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Methods: Fifty-six patients (18-85 yr, vitrectomies of more than one hour) were studied. In the volatile anesthetics groups, anesthesia was maintained by 1.3 MAC of isoflurane, sevoflurane or desflurane; in the propofol group, anesthesia was maintained by a continuous infusion of 6-8 mg(.)kg(-1) hr(-1) propofol. After bolus application of 0.1 mg(.)kg(-1) cisatracurium, a T1%-level of 10% of control level (train-of-four stimulation every 20 sec) was maintained using closed-loop feedback controlled infusion of cisatracurium. The effective therapeutic infusion rate (ETI) was estimated from the asymptotic steady-state infusion rate I-ss. The I-SS was derived from fitting an asymptotic line to the measured cumulative dose requirement curve. The ETI of the different groups was compared using Kruskal-Wallis- test, followed by rank sum test, corrected for the number of comparisons, P <0.05 was regarded as showing significant difference. Results: ETI in the isoflurane group was 35.6 +/- 8.6 mug(.)m(-2) min(-1), in the sevoflurane group 36.4-+/- 11.9 mug m(-2) min(-1), in the desflurane group 23.8 +/- 6.3 mug(.)m(-2) min(-1). The ETI of the volatile anesthetic groups were all significantly lower than the ETI in the propofol group at 61.7 +/- 25.3 mug(.)m(-2)min(-1) (P <0.002). The ETI in the desflurane group was significantly lower than in all other groups (P <0.02). Conclusion: In comparison to propofol, isoflurane, sevoflurane and desflurane reduce the cumulative dose requirements of cisatracurium to maintain a 90% neuromuscular blockade by 42%, 41% and 60%, respectively.

Five simulation studies were carried to select a sensitive test for comparing two independent groups of ERPs. Methods: Simulated signal and noise waveforms were generated using different combinations of parameters: cases or replications per group, correlation between data points, number of points, signal-to-noise ratio (S/N), etc. The false alarm (FA) rate of each method was assessed and their sensitivity compared over sets of 2000 simulated experiments per condition. Results: Study 1 identified the 'Projection onto Centroids Difference Vectors' (PCDV) method of Haig and Gordon (Brain Topogr 1995;8:67) as very good, but its FA rate was erratic under several conditions. The following studies served to shape the implementation parameters of a version of PCDV, termed PCDVp, that assesses significance through random permutations of the case labels. The final form is very sensitive. For instance, with two groups of 48 trials of 30-point EEG-like waveforms, its power for alpha = 0.05 is about 50% at S/N 1.0 and 90% at S/N 1.5 (amplitude). Conclusion: PCDVp requires no a priori knowledge and is sensitive to detect differences between independent sets of waveforms, topographies or spatio-temporal data.

The present study evaluated the role of the thalamus in age-related cognitive decline by investigating the correlations between thalamic volume, cognition and age. This was done in 57 healthy subjects ranging from 21 to 82 years of age. All subjects underwent neurocognitive testing with information processing tests and structural magnetic resonance imaging. A significant decrease in volume of the thalamus with increasing age was found, relatively stronger than and independent of the decrease of total brain volume. The decrease of thalamic volume was apparent before the onset of loss of volume of the total brain. Over the age-span studied, the thalamic decrease in volume correlated with the diminished performance on tests of cognitive speed. Additionally, in young and middle-aged, but not in old subjects, the size of the thalamus predicted performance on tasks that require cognitive speed. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Subjects monitored for words in auditorily presented sentences of three context types-normal, semantically anomalous, and random, at three rates of speech normal, 70% compressed (Experiment I) and 60% compressed (Experiment 2). Effects of semantics and syntax were found for the RHD and normal groups under the normal rate of speech condition. Using compressed rates of speech, the effect of syntax disappeared, but the effect of semantics remained. Importantly. and contrary to expectations, the RHD group was similar to normals in continuing to demonstrate an effect of semantic context under conditions of increased processing demands. Results are discussed relative to contemporary theories of laterality, based on studies with normals, that suggest that the involvement of the left versus right hemisphere in context use may depend upon the type of contextual information being processed.

Magnetic resonance-based studies have provided a number of important insights into the spatio-temporal evolution of the pathology of multiple sclerosis in vivo, particularly with respect to the relation between pathology and progression of disability. Magnetic resonance techniques have shown that this pathology is not restricted to the plaques that are evident at autopsy, but also involve the so-called normal-appearing white matter. Nonconventional magnetic resonance imaging strategies such as magnetization transfer imaging and spectroscopic imaging provide measures with higher pathological specificity for myelin and axonal injury. These and other advanced magnetic resonance techniques (such as the measurement of atrophy, lesion relaxation spectra, and lesion dynamics) are affording opportunities to use observations of patients to test biologically specific hypotheses. This should help us to better define new targets for drug therapy and to assess responses to new therapeutic agents. Curr Opin Neurol 14:279-287. (C) 2001 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

We aim to construct a model of relations between theories that succeeds where traditional models fail. We show that the multiple realizability argument, on which the autonomist model is thought to rest, is compatible with reductionism and, following kim, that an autonomist reading of the argument deprives psychology of its scientific status. We therefore opt for a reductionist model compatible with functionalism and multiple realizability, but show that, within evolutionary psychology at least, the very application of the conditions of reduction requires strong interactions between psychology and various other adjacent disciplines. We also show that reduction must be preceded in evolutionary psychology by an 'augmentation' of the reduction base, which brings still other disciplines into play. Finally,we present a model of the interaction between disciplines we believe accounts best for these relations and discuss the problems facing this kind of enterprise.

Unfortunately its use in pregnant women is associated with neural tube defects in the offspring. Although the etiology of neural tube defects is multifactorial, there is evidence that underlying genetic susceptibility plays a part. We describe two women taking moderate doses of VPA who repeatedly bore children with neural tube defects, despite folate supplementation.

Because of the striking findings and thorough neuropsychological studies of Patient H. M., the literature has focused on postsurgical occurrence of such memory impairment, with much less emphasis on other causes. Here we summarize, for comparison, the history of H. M. We report five patients with pronounced memory loss who had extensive neuropsychological and electroencephalographic testing. MRI was also performed in four of the patients, MRI volumetric measurements of amygdala and hippocampal formation in three, and measurements of entorhinal cortex in two. The amnesia occurred after head trauma in one patient, following encephalitis in one, after partial status epilepticus in two, and after unilateral surgical resection in a woman with bilateral lesions. On the basis of these studies it was impossible to distinguish the role of recurrent temporal lobe epileptic seizures as distinct from underlying lesions in the genesis and course of the memory loss. We review here the anatomical substrate, neuropsychological, and other investigations and the etiological factors leading to the amnesia in these patients, together with current concepts regarding possible causes of such severe memory dysfunction. In patients with this degree of severity of memory deficit, temporal resection in an attempt to control seizures did not lead to a measurable increase in memory problems. It also, however, did not bring about worthwhile improvement in seizure control. (C) 2001 Academic Press	[Guerreiro, Carlos A.

The effects of acute and sustained administration of reboxetine, on the firing activity of locus coeruleus NA neurons and dorsal raphe 5-HT neurons, were assessed using in vivo extracellular unitary recording in rats anaesthetized with chloral hydrate. Reboxetine (0.1-1.25 mg/kg, i.v.) dose-dependently decreased the firing activity of NA neurons (ED50 = 480 +/- 14 mug/kg). A 2-day treatment with reboxetine at 1.25, 2.5, 5, or 10 mg/kg per day (using osmotic minipumps implanted subcutaneously) produced significant decreases of 52%, 58%, 81%, and 83%, respectively, of NA firing activity. When the reboxetine treatment (2.5 mg/kg per day) duration was prolonged to 7 days, a 66% decrease in NA firing activity was observed which further decreased to 80% after 21 days of treatment. In contrast, 5-HT neuron firing rate remained unaltered following short- and long-term reboxetine treatments. The suppressant effect of the alpha (2)-adrenoceptor agonist clonidine on the firing activity of NA neurons was unchanged in long-term reboxetine-treated rats, but its effect on the firing activity of 5-HT neurons was blunted. The enhancement of NA firing activity by the 5-HT1A agonist 8-OH-DPAT was abolished in long-term reboxetine-treated rats, whereas, the inhibitory effect of the 5-HT2 agonist DOI was attenuated by about three-fold. In conclusion, sustained NA reuptake blockade by reboxetine lead to profound alterations in the function of NA neurons and of 5-HT receptors modulating their firing activity.

To further assess the role of the thalamus in the analysis of complex percepts, we have investigated whether neurons in the LP-pulvinar complex can signal the direction of motion of random-dot kinematograms wherein the individual elements of the pattern do not provide coherent motion cues. Our results indicate that a subset of LP-pulvinar cells can integrate the displacement of individual elements into a global motion percept and that their large receptive fields permit the integration of motion for elements separated by large spatial intervals. We also found that almost all of the global motion-sensitive neurons were not systematically pattern-motion-selective when tested with plaid patterns. The results indicate that LP-pulvinar cells can perform the higher-level spatio-temporal integration required to detect the global displacement of objects in a complex visual scene, further supporting the notion that extrageniculate thalamic cells are involved in higher-order motion processing. Furthermore, these results provide some evidence that there may be specialized mechanisms for processing different types of complex motion within the LP-pulvinar complex.

In the acute treatment studies, WAY100635 (1 mg/kg) induced a significant increase in 5-HT synthesis in the median raphe nucleus and some nerve terminal structures (range between 18 and 53%), while WAY 100135 (10 mg/kg) produced a significant decrease of synthesis, in the range between 16 and 33%, in the raphe magnus nucleus and several projection areas. The action of WAY 100635 given acutely was likely a result of antagonist actions at the 5-HT1A somato-dendritic autoreceptors. WAY 100135 probably acted acutely as a partial agonist. In the chronic treatment studies, WAY100635 (1 mg/kg/day) and WAY100135 (10 mg/kg/day) were administered for 7 days as s.c. injections once a day. Chronic treatment with both compounds significantly reduced the rate of 5-HT synthesis in, the nerve terminal structures and produced a significant increase in the raphe nuclei. These treatments did not have any effect on the plasma free or total tryptophan. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V./ECNP. All rights reserved.

Receptor binding studies and quantitative receptor autoradiography were performed, employing [H-3]mepyramine. Histamine H-1 receptors in rat brain displayed a higher density and a lower affinity compared with control human frontal cortex. Specific [H-3]mepyramine binding was heterogeneously distributed throughout the brain in both species. In human brain, binding was highest in the parietal and temporal cortices and lowest in caudate-putamen. In rat brain, binding was highest in the suprachiasmatic nucleus, dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, ventromedial hypothalamus, and nucleus accumbens. Cortical tissue from PCA rats and frontal cortical tissue from HE patients contained significantly increased densities (B-max) of H-1 receptors. A selective increase in H-1 receptor density was also observed in parietal and insular cortices of HE patients. Results of the present study suggest a selective up-regulation of brain H-1 receptors in PCA rats and in patients with HE. The central histaminergic system is implicated in the control of arousal and circadian rhythmicity. Previous studies have shown that blockade of H-1 receptors in PCA rats results in improved locomotor activity and circadian rhythmicity scores. The present findings suggest that cortical histaminergic hyperactivity could contribute to the neuropsychiatric symptoms characteristic of human HE, and that selective histamine H-1 receptor antagonists could be beneficial in the prevention and treatment of some of the symptoms of HE in cirrhotic patients.

Such boosting of this fundamental immune cell population suggests a prophylactic role for this herb in normal animals. Based on this evidence, our goal in the present work was to assess the role of dietary administration of this herbal extract to mice bearing leukemia, a type of tumor well known to be a target for NK cells. Design: A commercially available root extract of E. purpurea, which we have already shown to be highly effective in mice, was administered daily for 50 days from the onset of leukemia (day 0). Control leukemic mice received no extract. Other leukemic mice received the NK-enhancing neurohormone, melatonin, administered precisely as above. In all treatment and control categories, some mice were sampled at 9 days after tumor onset, others were sampled at 3 months, and still others were left to assess treatment effect on life span. Results: At 9 days (intermediate stage leukemia; death beginning by day 17-18), E. purpurea-treated mice had a 2.5-fold increase in the absolute numbers of NK cells in their spleens. By 3 months after leukemia onset, E. purpurea-treated mice still had 2-3 times the normal numbers of NK cells in their spleens. No leukemic, untreated (control) mice remained alive at 3 months, hence the comparison with normal animals. Moreover, at 3 months post-tumor onset, all the major hemopoietic and immune cell lineages in their bone marrow birth site, were recorded at normal numbers, in E. purpurea-consuming, leukemic mice. The survival advantage provided by administering these leukemic mice with E. purpurea was highly significant versus untreated, leukemic mice when analyzed by Kaplan-Meier survival statistics. Conclusion: The present study has provided the first systematic analysis, under controlled laboratory conditions, of the effect(s) of the botanical, E. purpurea, in vivo, in leukemic hosts. The profoundly positive effects of this herb in disease abatement observed in this study suggest the therapeutic potential of E. purpurea, at least with respect to leukemia, if not other tumors as well.

Because oxidant stress abundantly generates thromboxane A(2) (TxA(2)), we tested whether TxA(2) plays a role in retinal vasoobliteration of OIR and contributes to such vascular degeneration by direct endothelial cytotoxicity. Hyperoxia-induced retinal vasoobliteration in rat pups (80% O-2 exposure from postnatal days 5-14) was associated with increased TxB(2) generation and was significantly prevented by TxA(2) synthase inhibitor CGS-12970 (10 mg . kg(-1). day(-1))or TxA(2)-receptor antagonist CGS-22652 (10 mg . kg(-1). day(-1)). TxA(2) mimetics U-46619 (EC50 50 nM) and I-BOP (EC50 5 nM) caused a time- and concentration-dependent cell death of neuroretinovascular endothelial cells from rats as well as newborn pigs but not of smooth muscle and astroglial cells; other prostanoids did not cause cell death. The peroxidation product 8-iso-PGF(2), which is generated in OIR, stimulated TxA(2) formation by endothelial cells and triggered cell death; these effects were markedly diminished by CGS-12970. TxA(2)-dependent neuroretinovascular endothelial cell death was mostly by necrosis and to a lesser extent by apoptosis. The data identify an important role for TxA(2) in vasoobliteration of OIR and unveil a so far unknown function for TxA(2) in directly triggering neuroretinal microvascular endothelial cell death. These effects of TxA(2) might participate in other ischemic neurovascular injuries.

Here we show that CKI alpha co purifies with centaurin-alpha (1), in brain and that they interact in vitro and form a complex in cells. In addition, we show that the association is direct and occurs through the kinase domain of CKI within a loop comprising residues 217-233. These residues are well conserved in all members of the CKI: family, and we show that centaurin-alpha (1) associates in vitro with all mammalian CKI isoforms. To date, CKI alpha represents the first protein partner identified for centaurin-alpha (1). However, our data suggest that centaurin-alpha (1), is not a substrate for CKI alpha and has no effect on CKI alpha activity. Centaurin-alpha (1), has been identified as a phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate-binding protein. Centaurin-alpha (1), contains a cysteine-rich domain that is shared by members of a newly identified family of ADP-ribosylation factor guanosine trisphosphatase-activating proteins. These proteins are involved in membrane trafficking and actin cytoskeleton rearrangement, thus supporting a role for CKI alpha in these biological events.

Both plasma input models and reference tissue input models are considered. General theory is derived and the systems are characterized in terms of their impulse response functions. The theory shows that the macro parameters of the system may be determined simply from the coefficients of the impulse response functions. These results are discussed in the context of radioligand binding studies. It is shown that binding potential is simply related to the integral of the impulse response functions for all plasma and reference tissue input models currently used in PET. This article also introduces a general compartmental description for the behavior of the tracer in blood, which then allows for the blood volume-induced bias in reference tissue input models to be assessed.

Studies of the pathological changes that characterize AD, together with several other lines of evidence, indicate that A beta accumulation in vivo may initiate and!or contribute to the process of neurodegeneration observed in the AD brain. However, the underlying mechanisms by which A beta peptide influences/causes degeneration of the basal forebrain cholinergic neurones in AD brains remain obscure. We reported earlier that nM concentrations of A beta -related peptides. under acute conditions, can potently inhibit K+-evoked endogenous acetylcholine (ACh) release from the hippocampus and the cortex but not from striatum in young adult rats (J. Neurosci. 16 (1996) 1034). In the present study, to determine whether the effects of A beta peptides alter with normal aging and/or cognitive state, we have measured A beta (1-40) levels and the effects of exogenous A beta (1-40) on hippocampal ACh release in young adult as well as aged cognitively-unimpaired (AU) and -impaired (AI) rats. Endogenous levels of A beta (1-40) in the hippocampus are significantly increased in aged rats. Additionally, 10 nM A beta (1-40) potently inhibited endogenous ACh release from the hippocampus of the three groups of rats, but the time-course of the effects clearly indicate that the cholinergic neurones of AI rats are more sensitive to A beta peptides than either AU or young adult rats. These results, together with earlier reports, suggest that the processing of the precursor protein of A beta peptide alters with normal aging and the response of the cholinergic neurones to the peptide possibly varies with the cognitive status of the animals.

Sex steroids influence the secretory dynamics of GH, but the neuroendocrine mechanisms have not been conclusively established. Because periventricular hypothalamic somatostatin (SST) expression is greater in males than in females, we generated knockout (Smst(-/-)) mice to investigate whether SST peptides are necessary for sexually differentiated GH secretion and action. Despite marked increases in nadir and median plasma GH levels in both sexes of Smst(-/-) compared with Smst(+/+) mice, the mutant mice had growth curves identical to their sibling controls and retained a normal sexual dimorphism in weight and length. In contrast, the liver of male Smst(-/-) mice was feminized, resulting in an identical profile of GH-regulated hepatic mRNAs between male and female mutants. Male Smst(-/-) mice show higher expression of two SST receptors in the hypothalamus and pituitary than do females. These data indicate that SST is required to masculinize the ultradian GH rhythm by suppressing interpulse GH levels. In the absence of SST, male and female mice exhibit similarly altered plasma GH profiles that eliminate sexually dimorphic liver function but do not affect dimorphic growth.

The strategy consists of setting activity restrictions for children hospitalized and those seen in the emergency department after a HI that may or not have been sports related. It was developed based on extensive clinical experiments with families of children with a HI and existing guidelines for returning athletes to sports. Possible merits and pitfalls of the strategy are discussed.

To determine if male hormones could also be neuroprotective, we investigated the effect of testosterone, methyltestosterone, and epitestosterone at physiological concentrations on primary cultures of human neurons induced to undergo apoptosis by serum deprivation. Serum deprivation significantly induces neuronal apoptosis in a protracted fashion. As expected, physiological concentrations of 17-beta -estradiol and transcriptionally inactive 17-alpha -estradiol protect neurons against apoptosis. Similar to 17-beta -estradiol, physiological concentrations of testosterone are also neuroprotective. Androgen receptors are present at 8 +/- 2 fmol/mg protein in the neuron cultures. The non-aromatizable androgen, mibolerone, is also neuroprotective and aromatase inhibitor, 4-androsten-4-OL-3,17-dione, does not prevent testosterone-mediated neuroprotection. In contrast, anti-androgen, flutamide, eliminates testosterone-mediated neuroprotection. Testosterone analog, methyltestosterone, showed androgen receptor-dependent neuroprotection that was delayed in time indicating that a metabolite may be the active agent. The endogenous anti-androgen, epitestosterone, also showed a slight neuroprotective effect but not through the androgen receptor. These results indicate that androgens induce neuroprotection directly through the androgen receptor. These data suggest that androgens may also be of therapeutic value against Alzheimer's disease in aging males.

HO-1 mRNA levels and mitochondrial uptake of [Fe-55]Cl-3-derived iron were measured in rat astroglial cultures exposed to interleukin-l beta (IL-1) or tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) alone or in combination with the heme oxygenase-l (HO-1) inhibitors, tin mesoporphyrin (SnMP) or dexamthasone (DEX), or interferon beta 1b (INF-P). HO-1 expression in astrocytes was evaluated by immunohistochemical staining of spinal cord tissue derived from MS and control subjects. IL-1 beta or TNF-alpha promoted sequestration of non-transferrin-derived 55Fe by astroglial mitochondria. HO-1 inhibitors, m beta itochondrial permeability transition pore (MTP) blockers and antioxidants significantly attenuated cytokine-related mitochondrial iron sequestration in these cells. IFN-p decreased HO-1 expression and mitochondrial iron sequestration in IL-1 beta- and TNF-cr-challenged astroglia. The percentage of astrocytes coexpressing HO-1 in affected spinal cord from MS patients (57.3% +/- 12.8%) was significantly greater (p < 0.05) than in normal spinal cord derived from controls subjects (15.4% +/- 8.4%). HO-1 is overexpressed in MS spinal cord astroglia and may promote mitochondrial iron deposition in MS plaques. In MS, IFN-beta may attenuate glial HO-1 gene induction and aberrant mitochondrial iron deposition accruing from exposure to proinflammatory cytokines.

Although several sets of evidence point towards an indirect multicellular inflammatory pathway, gp 120, one of the HIV-1 env products. was shown to be very cytotoxic for neurons in vitro. To explore a direct pathway in the physiopathology of dementia in AIDS. we developed transgenic mouse models carrying the HIV-1 env proteins gp 120 and gp 41 (gp 160) under the control of the human light neurofilament and murine heavy neurofilament promoters. To date, this is the first mouse model in which the HIV-I env protein can be detected in neurons by immunohistochemistry. The expression is found in several brainstem and spinal cord gray structures and in the cerebellum in one of the mouse lines bearing the NFHgp160 transgene. The morphological findings at 3 months are subtle and are dominated by a watery, dendritic degeneration and a reactive gliosis. At 12 months, the evidence of neuronal degeneration and loss is present along with various degenerative phenomena involving synapses, dendrites and axons, including axonal swellings. Cytoskeletal abnormalities were found by immunohistochemistry. Chronic inflammation was also observed in the leptomeninges of the spinal cord and brainstem and in the cerebellar white matter. These models thus offer an exciting sequence of morphological findings initiated by the neuronal expression of the HIV-I env proteins anti offer a different tool to explore the neuronal dysfunction in AIDS.

J	Giroux, N; Reader, TA; Rossignol, S				Giroux, N; Reader, TA; Rossignol, S			Comparison of the effect of intrathecal administration of clonidine and yohimbine on the locomotion of intact and spinal cats	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article							II MUSCLE AFFERENTS; TREADMILL LOCOMOTION; CUTANEOUS REFLEXES; ALPHA-MOTONEURONES; MOTOR CORTEX; NEONATAL RAT; ADULT CATS; CORD; NEURONS; MODULATION	Several studies have shown that noradrenergic mechanisms are important for locomotion. For instance, L-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) can initiate "fictive" locomotion in immobilized acutely spinalized cats and alpha (2)-noradrenergic agonists, such as 2,6,-dichloro-N-2-imidazolidinylid-enebenzenamine (clonidine), can induce treadmill locomotion soon after spinalization. However, the activation of noradrenergic receptors may be not essential for the basic locomotor rhythmicity because chronic spinal cats can walk with the hindlimbs on a treadmill in the absence of noradrenergic stimulation because the descending pathways are completely severed. This suggests that locomotion, in intact and spinal conditions, is probably expressed and controlled through different neurotransmitter mechanisms. To test this hypothesis, we compared the effect of the ct, agonist, clonidine, and the antagonist (16 alpha, 17 alpha)-17-hydroxy yohimbine-16-carboxylic acid methyl ester hydrochloride (yohimbine), injected intrathecally at L-3-L-4 before and after spinalization in the same cats chronically implanted with electrodes to record electromyograms (EMGs). In intact cats, clonidine (50-150 mug/100 mul) modulated the locomotor pattern slightly causing a decrease in duration of the step cycle accompanied with some variation of EMG burst amplitude and duration. In the spinal state, clonidine could trigger robust and sustained hind limb locomotion in the first week after the spinalization at a time when the cats were paraplegic. Later, after the spontaneous recovery of a stable locomotor pattern, clonidine prolonged the cycle duration, increased the amplitude and duration of flexor and extensor bursts, and augmented the foot drag at the onset of swing. In intact cats, yohimbine at high doses (800-1600 mug/100 mul) caused major walking difficulties characterized by asymmetric stepping, stumbling with poor lateral stability, and, at smaller doses (400 mug/100 mul), only had slight effects such as abduction of one of the hindlimbs and the turning of the hindquarters to one side. After spinalization, yohimbine had no effect even at the largest doses. These results indicate that, in the intact state, noradrenergic mechanisms probably play an important role in the control of locomotion since blocking the receptors results in a marked disruption of walking. In the spinal state, although the receptors are still present and functional since they can be activated by clonidine, they are seemingly not critical for the spontaneous expression of spinal locomotion since their blockade by yohimbine does not impair spinal locomotion. It is postulated therefore that the expression of spinal-locomotion must depend on the activation of other types of receptors, probably related to excitatory amino acids.

However, although these functions are likely regulated by the synaptic properties, the interactions of PSCs with the synaptic elements are not known. Therefore, our goal was to study the interactions between mammalian PSCs in situ and the presynaptic terminals using changes in intracellular Ca2+ as an indicator of cell activity. Motor nerve stimulation induced an increase in intracellular Ca2+ in PSCs, and this increase yas greatly reduced when transmitter release was blocked. Furthermore, local application of acetylcholine induced Ca2+ responses that were blocked by the muscarinic antagonist atropine and mimicked by the muscarinic agonist muscarine. The nicotinic antagonist alpha -bungarotoxin had no effect on Ca2+ responses induced by acetylcholine. Local application of the cotransmitter ATP induced Ca2+ responses that were unaffected by the P2 antagonist suramin, whereas local application of adenosine induced Ca2+ responses that were greatly reduced by the A1 receptor antagonist 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dimethylxanthine (CPT). However, the presence of the A1 antagonist in the perfusate did not block responses induced by ATP. Ca2+ responses evoked by stimulation of the motor nerve were reduced in the presence of CPT, whereas atropine almost completely abolished them. Ca2+ responses were further reduced when both antagonists were present simultaneously. Hence, PSCs at the mammalian NMJ respond to the release of neurotransmitter induced by stimulation of the motor nerve through the activation of muscarinic and adenosine A1 receptors.

Here we demonstrate that netrin-1 continues to be expressed in the adult rat spinal cord at a level similar to that in the embryonic CNS. In contrast, netrin-3, which is also expressed in the embryonic spinal cord, was not detected in the adult. In situ hybridization analysis demonstrated that cells in the white matter and the gray matter of the adult spinal cord express netrin-1. Colocalization studies using the neuronal marker NeuN revealed that netrin-1 is expressed by multiple classes of spinal interneurons and motoneurons. Markers identifying glial cell types indicated that netrin-1 is expressed by most, if not all, oligodendrocytes but not by astrocytes. During neural development, netrin-1 has been proposed to function as a diffusible long-range cue for growing axons. We show that in the adult spinal cord the majority of netrin-1 protein is not freely soluble but is associated with membranes or the extracellular matrix. Fractionation of adult spinal cord white matter demonstrated that netrin-1 was absent from fractions enriched for compact myelin but was enriched in fractions containing periaxonal myelin and axolemma, indicating that netrin-1 protein may be localized to the periaxonal space. These findings suggest that in addition to its role as a long-range guidance cue for developing axons, netrin may have a short-range function associated with the cell surface that contributes to the maintenance of appropriate neuronal and axon-oligodendroglial interactions in the mature nervous system.

This model and other transgenic models with disrupted neurofilaments are used widely to investigate the role of the neurofilament cytoskeleton in normal neurons and in inherited or acquired diseases. To interpret such studies, it is important to establish whether the maldistribution of neurofilaments has major secondary consequences on the cell biology of the affected neurons. Notably, multiple perturbations of the nervous system simultaneously affect both the neuronal cytoskeleton and neurotrophin expression. To determine whether the expression of neurotrophic factors or their receptors is perturbed by a primary disruption in neurofilaments, we compared the accumulated mRNA levels for ciliary neuroptrophic factor (CNTF), nerve growth factor, neurotrophin 3, and the alpha CNTF receptor in mature transgenic mice and their littermate controls. Consistently with the prolonged survival of neurons expressing atypical or abnormally distributed neurofilaments, no obvious changes were observed for any of the mRNA species examined.

The occurrence of movement disorders is exceptional and is usually part of a clinical syndrome called acquired hepatocerebral degeneration, which is a subtype of chronic recurrent hepatic encephalopathy. The clinical picture is usually progressive and pathologic findings include regional astroglial and neuronal abnormalities found predominantly in cortex and basal ganglia. As for hepatic encephalopathy in general, the pathophysiology of this disorder is unknown but hyperammonemia and/or brain manganese overload may play a role. Medical treatment is often disappointing but in selected cases liver transplantation may be curative.

Acute liver failure is characterized by rapid evolution of HE and by brain edema. Portal-Systemic encephalopathy (PSE) is particularly prevalent following treatment of portal hypertension or ascites by the TIPS procedure. Available evidence currently suggests that neurotransmission changes rather than brain energy failure are the primary cause of HE. Recent studies both in autopsied brain tissue from HE patients as well as in experimental animal models of HE reveal that liver failure results in altered expression of several genes coding for proteins having key roles in the control of neuronal excitability. Such alterations include decreased expression of the glutamate transporter GLT-1, and increased expression of monoamine oxidase (MAO-A isoform), the "peripheral-type" benzodiazepine receptor (PTBR) as well as constitutive neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS). Such changes result in altered protein expression and in increased extracellular brain glutamate, increased degradation of monoamine neurotransmitters, increased synthesis of neurosteroids with inhibitory properties, and increased production of nitric oxide (respectively) in brain in chronic liver failure. In the case of GLT-1, PTBR, and nNOS, alterations in expression result from exposure to ammonia and/or manganese, two neurotoxic agents shown previously to be increased in brain in liver failure.

As part of a series of studies to elucidate the mechanism(s) involved in this protective effect, groups of rats with ALF resulting from hepatic devascularization were maintained at either 37 degreesC (normothermic) or 35 degreesC (hypothermic), and neurological status was monitored in relation to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations of ammonia and lactate. CSF was removed via implanted cisterna magna catheters. Mild hypothermia resulted in a delay in onset of encephalopathy and prevention of brain edema; CSF concentrations of ammonia and lactate were concomitantly decreased. Blood ammonia concentrations, on the other hand, were not affected by hypothermia in ALF rats. These findings suggest that brain edema and encephalopathy in ALF are the consequence of ammonia-induced impairment of brain energy metabolism and open the way for magnetic resonance spectroscopic monitoring of cerebral function in ALF. Mild hypothermia could be beneficial in the prevention of severe encephalopathy and brain edema in patients with ALF awaiting liver transplantation.

OPs cocultured with dorsal root ganglia explants migrated around the culture and formed numerous contacts with axons. The duration of these contacts depended on the morphology of the OF, with OPs containing four or more processes forming long-lasting contacts and OPs with three or fewer processes forming short-termed contacts. Treatment with N-cadherin function blocking peptides approximately halved the duration of contacts made by cells with four or more processes but contact times for cells with three or less processes were unaffected. The L7 cadherin-blocking antibody and calcium withdrawal had similar effects. Contacts with axons regenerating from explants of adult retina, which do not have N-cadherin on their surface was examined. The contact duration of OPs to adult retina axons was short and similar in length to those formed between OPs and dorsal root ganglion axons in the presence of cadherin blocking reagents. Oligodendrocyte myelination was examined in organotypic rat cerebellar slice cultures, taken before myelination at postnatal day 10 and then allowed to myelinate in vitro over 7 days. When incubated with an N-cadherin function-blocking peptide, myelination of Purkinje cell axons was reduced to about half of control levels, while control peptides were without effect. Cadherin-blockade did not prevent maturation of OPs, since oligodendrocytes showing myelin basic protein immunostaining were still found in these cultures. However, many of the cell processes did not colocalize with calbindin-positive axons. From these data we conclude that N-cadherin is important for the initial contact between a myelinating oligodendrocyte and axons and significantly contributes to the success of myelination.

To evaluate other deficits, glutamate receptors sensitive to N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) were examined by autoradiography with [H-3]MK-801 in 36 brain regions from heterozygous (wv/+) and homozygous (wv/wv) weaver mutants, and compared to wild type (+/+) mice. In wv/+ and wv/wv mutants labelling decreased in cortical regions, septum, hippocampus, subiculum. neostriatum, nucleus accumbens, superior colliculus and in the cerebellar granular layer, The reductions in [H-3]MK-801 binding were particularly specific in the cerebellar granular layer of wv/wv mutants, but an ubiquitous altered NMDA receptor topology was revealed in other brain regions. Abnormal developmental signals, or aberrant cellular responses, may underlie widespread NMDA receptor reductions, while in cerebellar cortex they could be lacking due to the massive loss of cerebellar granule cells.

Simulations demonstrate that the muscarinic receptor-induced non-specific cation current, I(CANM), could contribute to these phenomena. Facilitation of I(CANM) by calcium influx during spikes induced by the sample stimulus can cause enhanced responses for matches as well as delay activity. In a network, lateral inhibition can produce match suppression, and in conjunction with stimulus selective/non-selective cells produce non-match enhancement and suppression.

The present work demonstrates how in some cases different manipulations of the same raw data, corresponding to different commonly used methodologies, produce discordant results. Midsagittal CC area was measured from magnetic resonance images (MRIs) of 137 young normal volunteers. Three strategies intended to normalize for average differences in brain size between the sexes, as well as five different normalization variables, were contrasted and evaluated. The stereotaxic method normalizes for intersubject differences in overall brain size by scaling MRIs into a standardized space. The ratio method uses one of five different indices of brain size and divides it into CC area. The covariate method uses one of the indices as a covariate in statistical analyses. Male subjects show significantly larger absolute total area, as well as anterior third and posterior midbody. However, in two of three normalization strategies, namely the stereotaxic and ratio methods, females show relatively larger total area, anterior midbody, and splenium, The covariate method did not show any significant differences at the 0.05 level. Results suggest that different approaches to normalization and analysis are not necessarily equivalent and interchangeable. (C) 2001 Academic Press.

Experiments were run using male Sprague-Dawley rats (350-375 g) anesthetized with Na-pentobarbital (50 mg/kg, i.p.) and acutely spinalized at T9. Spinal segments L1-4 were exposed for extracellular single unit recording of on-going and stimulation-evoked activity of eight wide dynamic range neurones. Ongoing activity was unaffected by meloxicam (0.1 mg/kg, i.v.). However, responses to noxious mechanical stimulation (21 N for 3 s) of the cutaneous receptive field of the hind paw were depressed by meloxicam in particular the afterdischarge (34.50 +/- 6.06% inhibition) in all eight neurones studied. The brief initial discharge in response to stimulation was depressed less (15.31 +/- 4.89% inhibition, n = 7/8). The data indicate that the percent inhibition of the afterdischarge was significantly greater than that of the initial discharge (P < 0.05). Given the selectivity of meloxicam for COX-2, the data suggest that COX-2 may be involved in mediating and/or modulating excitatory effects of nociceptive inputs to dorsal horn neurones, in particular the prolonged stimulation-evoked afterdischarge.

To delete genes specifically in neurons during the late phase of brain development, we have generated transgenic mouse lines that express Cre recombinase under the control of the murine neurofilament-H (mNF-H) gene promoter. In this study, we report that one of these mouse lines expresses Cre recombinase specifically in the neurons of the brain and spinal cord during the late stage of their development. The transgenic line displays specific excision of the loxP-flanked gene in the neurons just after embryonic day 18.5 (E.18.5). which coincides with the later phase of brain maturation including spinal cord and olfactory bulb area. This mNF-H-cre transgenic mouse line will be valuable for studying in vivo functions of neuron-specific genes, particularly: defining their precise roles in the mature nervous system using conditional gene targeting strategies.

J	Sahlas, DJ				Sahlas, DJ			Functional neuroanatomy in the pre-hippocratic era: Observations from the Iliad of Homer	NEUROSURGERY			English	Article						history of medicine; ancient; Homer; nervous system; neuroanatomy; trauma		OBJECTIVE: To describe observations of neurological significance made in the Iliad of Homer and to interpret these relative to pre-Hippocratic concepts of health and disease in Ancient Greece. METHODS: English translations of the Iliad were analyzed for references of neurological significance, and the Homeric Creek was subsequently reviewed for accuracy. Findings are discussed in the context of ancient Creek ideas regarding anatomy and physiology, early descriptions and conceptualizations of the nervous system, ancient Creek theories concerning illness and disease, and the practice of medicine in the pre-Hippocratic era. RESULTS: Descriptions of injuries sustained by soldiers fighting in the Trojan War represent some of the earliest case histories of neurotrauma. Passages in the Iliad describe immediate death after penetrating head trauma with injury to the brain or the brainstem, make reference to clinical signs of brain injury, and mention neurological signs and symptoms after damage to the spinal cord, brachial plexus, and peripheral nerves. CONCLUSION: The Iliad of Homer contains many descriptions of traumatic injury to the nervous system and provides us with 3000-year-old references to some of the basic principles of functional neuroanatomy.

This study was designed to investigate the effects of advanced aging on the optic nerve head (ONH) structure and retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness in the eldest segment of our population. Methods. Twenty-seven healthy elderly subjects between 75 and 88 years of age (average, 80.1 +/- 0.83 years) and 30 healthy younger subjects between 20 and 32 years of age (average, 23.1 +/- 0.50 years) were recruited for a cross-sectional comparison between ONH morphology and RNFL thickness as measured by scanning laser tomography. The ONH disc, cup, and rim areas; cup-to-disc ratio; and the mean thickness of the RNFL were quantified. Results. The cup and disc areas as well as the cup-to-disc area ratio increased with age, whereas the RNFL thickness decreased during the course of normal senescence. Conclusions. Any diagnoses of ocular pathology in the elderly must differentiate the effects of normal aging on the ONH topography and RNFL thickness. To that effect, the present study provides a clinical profile of ocular structures that extend into the oldest geriatric age group.

We address research on preventing mental illness and its relation to existing conceptions of public health, a topic to which insufficient attention has been paid in the era of the biological brain, while using this case study to illustrate the limits of conventional approaches in bioethics. After identifying the crucial need for methodological self-consciousness in prevention research and policy, we explore the implications as they relate to (i) the values embedded in the choice of research designs and strategies, and (ii) contrasting intellectual starting points regarding the biological plausibility of preventing mental illness. We then draw attention to the need for more thoughtful analysis of the appropriate role and limits of economics in making choices about prevention of mental illness. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

One therapeutic intervention may be the development of a chelator that could remove mitochondrial Fe. We have implemented the only well characterized model of mammalian mitochondrial Fe overload to examine the Fe chelation efficacy of novel chelators of the 2-pyridylcarboxaldehyde isonicotinoyl hydrazone (PCIH) class. In this model we utilize reticulocytes treated with the haem synthesis inhibitor succinylacetone which results in mitochondrial Fe-loading. Our experiments demonstrate that in contrast to desferrioxamine, several of the PCIH analogues show very high activity at mobilizing Fe-59 from Fe-59-loaded reticulocytes. Further studies on these ligands in animals are clearly warranted considering their potential to treat FA. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

We investigated whether the OEM system is activated by speech gestures presented in the visual and auditory modalities. We found that visual observation of speech movement enhanced MEP amplitude specifically in muscles involved in production of the observed speech. In contrast, listening to the sound did not produce MEP enhancement. The findings suggest that the OEM system may be modality specific. It may be involved in action recognition in the visual modality, but is not responsible for perception of simple items of sound. NeuroReport 12:1341-1344 (C) 2001 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

Background: A reduction in the volume of the entorhinal cortex ipsilateral to the seizure focus in patients with intractable temporal lobe epilepsy and hippocampal atrophy was recently shown. Methods: MRI volumetric analysis of the entorhinal cortex was performed using a T1-weighted three-dimensional gradient echo sequence in 24 control subjects and 22 patients with temporal lobe epilepsy and normal hippocampal volumes. Thirteen patients underwent surgery, with a mean postoperative follow-up of 36 months. Results: Group analysis (multivariate analysis of variance) showed a reduction in the volume of the entorhinal cortex ipsilateral to the seizure focus in patients with left (p < 0.0001) and right temporal lobe epilepsy (p <: 0.0001). Lateralization of the seizure focus could be done in 14 of 22 patients (64%) based on entorhinal cortex volumetry. Conclusion: Entorhinal cortex atrophy ipsilateral to the seizure focus supports the presence of structural damage in the mesial temporal lobe in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy and normal hippocampal volumes and emphasizes the participation of the entorhinal cortex in the pathogenesis of this disorder.

The molecular basis of this enhanced sensitivity to AMPH is poorly understood: however, adaptive changes in the mesocorticolimbic dopamine system has been postulated to be of primary importance. In the present investigation we used Western blotting to examine the expression of candidate presynaptic proteins involved in regulating neurotransmitter release and synaptic plasticity. Specifically. syntaxin I, synaptophysin and synapsin I protein levels were examined in the nucleus accumbens (Nacc) and ventral tegmental area (VTA) of Sprague-Dawley rats following AMPH-sensitization. Animals received five repeated administrations of AMPH (1.5 mg/kg, i.p. on alternate days) followed by 14 days of withdrawal. Levels of syntaxin I and synaptophysin were found to be significantly reduced in the Nacc core of sensitized animals compared to saline-treated and untreated controls. However, syntaxin I expression was significantly increased in the Nace shell subregion of sensitized animals. No significant difference in the level of synapsin I was noted in any of the brain regions. Further, expression of none of the synaptic proteins was significantly altered in the VTA of sensitized animals. Given the importance of syntaxin and synaptophysin in learning and memory processes and in the regulation of neurotransmitter release, changes in these proteins suggest their involvement in the associative learning aspects of sensitization and differential neurotransmitter release in the Nace subregions.

The disease is associated with progressive impaired vision, macular cherry-red spots, and myoclonus (sialidosis type I) or with skeletal dysplasia, Hurler-like phenotype, dysostosis multiplex, mental retardation, and hepatosplenomegaly (sialidosis type II). We analyzed the effect of the missense mutations G68V, S182G, G227R, F260Y, L270F, A298V, G328S, and L363P, which are identified in the sialidosis type I and sialidosis type II patients, on the activity, stability, and intracellular distribution of sialidase. We found that three mutations, F260Y, L270F, and A298V, which are clustered in the same region on the surface of the sialidase molecule, dramatically reduced the enzyme activity and caused a rapid intralysosomal degradation of the expressed protein. We suggested that this region might be involved in sialidase binding with lysosomal cathepsin A and/or P-galactosidase in the multienzyme lysosomal complex required for the expression of sialidase activity. Transgenic expression of mutants followed by density gradient centrifugation of cellular extracts confirmed this hypothesis and showed that sialidase deficiency in some sialidosis patients results from disruption of the lysosomal multienzyme complex.

Transgenic animals expressing mutant SOD1 in all tissues develop an ALS-like phenotype. To determine whether neuron-specific expression of mutant SOD1 is sufficient to produce such a phenotype, we generated transgenic animals carrying the G37R mutation that is associated with the familial form of ALS (FALS), which is driven by the neurofilament light chain promoter. The transgenic animals express high levels of the human SOD1 protein in neuronal tissues, especially in the large motor neurons of the spinal cord, but they show no apparent motor deficit at up to 1.5 years of age. Our animal model suggests that neuron-specific expression of ALS-associated mutant human SOD1 may not be sufficient for the development of the disease in mice.

We report that NGF (0.1-100 ng/ml) rapidly (<60 min) and robustly enhanced constitutive acetylcholine (ACh) release (148-384% of control) from basal forebrain cultures without immediate persistent increases in choline acetyltransferase activity. More ACh was released in response to NGF when exposure was coupled with a higher depolarization level, suggesting activity dependence. In a long-term potentiation-like manner, brief NGF exposure (10 ng/ml; 60 min) induced robust and prolonged increases in ACh release, a capacity that was shared with the other neurotrophins. K252a (10-100 nM), BAPTA-AM (25 <mu>M), and Cd2+ (200 muM) prevented NGF enhancement of ACh release, suggesting the involvement of TrkA receptors, Ca2+, and voltage-gated Ca2+ channels, respectively. Forskolin (10 muM), a cAMP generator, enhanced constitutive ACh release but did not interact synergistically with NGF. Tetrodotoxin (1 muM) and cycloheximide (2 mu mM) did not prevent NGF-induced ACh release, indicative of action at the level of the cholinergic nerve terminal and that new protein synthesis is not required for this neurotransmitter-like effect, respectively. In contrast, after a 24 hr NGF treatment, distinct protein synthesis-dependent and independent effects on choline acetyltransferase activity and ACh release were observed. These results indicate that neuromodulator/neurotransmitter-like (protein synthesis-independent) and neurotrophic (translation-dependent) actions likely make distinct contributions to the enhancement of cholinergic activity by NGF.

Only some of these changes are maintained after acute spinalization, indicating the involvement of descending pathways in functional recovery. Here, we address whether the development of these adaptive changes is dependent on descending pathways. The left LGS nerve was cut in three chronic spinal cats. Combined kinematics and electromyographic (EMG) recordings were obtained before and for 8 d after the neurectomy. An increased yield at the ankle was present early after neurectomy and, as in nonspinal cats, was gradually reduced within 8 d. Compensation involved transient changes in step cycle structure and a longer term increase in postcontact medial gastrocnemius (MG) EMG activity. Precontact MG EMG only increased in one of three cats. In a terminal experiment, the influence of group I afferents from MG and LGS on stance duration was measured in two cats. LGS effectiveness at increasing stance duration was largely decreased in both cats. MG effectiveness was only slightly changed: increased in one cat and decreased in another. In cat 3, the plantaris nerve was cut after LGS recovery. The recovery time courses from both neurectomies were similar ( p > 0.8), suggesting that this spinal compensation is likely a generalizable adaptive strategy. From a functional perspective, the spinal cord therefore must be considered capable of adaptive locomotor plasticity after motor nerve lesions. This finding is of prime importance to the understanding of functional plasticity after spinal injury.

The effects of the same drugs are compared in various preparations: complete spinal, partial spinal or intact cats. This has revealed that there can be major differences in these effects. In turn, this suggests that although the locomotor rhythm might normally be triggered and modulated by the activation of a variety of receptors (noradrenaline, serotonin, glutamate), after spinalization there appears to he a predominance of glutamatergic mechanisms. Recent work also suggests that, in the cat, the integrity of the midlumbar segments is crucial for the expression of spinal locomotion. Taken together, this work raises some hope that a targeted pharmacotherapy with better understood drugs and mode and locus of delivery could become a clinical reality.

To further our understanding of the cortical deficit in strabismic amblyopia, we measured, compared and mapped functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) activation between the fixing and fellow amblyopic eyes of ten strabismic amblyopes. 2. Of specific concern was whether the function of any visual area was spared in strabismic amblyopia, as recently suggested, by both positron emission tomography (PET) and fMRI studies, and whether there was a close relationship between the fMRI response and known psychophysical deficits. 3. To answer these questions we measured the psychophysical deficit in each subject and used stimuli whose relationship to the psychophysical deficit was known. 4. We observed that stimuli that were well within the amblyopic passband did produce reduced fMRI activation, even in visual area V1. This suggests that V1 is anomalous in amblyopia. A similar level of reduction was observed in V2. 5. In two subjects, we found that stimuli outside the amblyopic passband produced activation in visual area V3A. 6. We did not find a close relationship between the fMRI response reduction in amblyopia and either of the known psychophysical deficits even though the fMRI response reduction in amblyopia did covary with stimulus spatial frequency.

We have tested this hypothesis in a primary culture model in which mutant human SODI was expressed in motor neurons of dissociated spinal cord cultures. Preventing formation of nitrotyrosine by inhibiting nitric oxide synthase rescued cultured motor neurons from excitotoxic death induced by adding glutamate to the culture medium, but failed to significantly delay death of motor neurons expressing the G93A mutant SODI. The results do not support generation of nitrotyrosine being the predominant lethal gain of function conferred by mutations in SODI. NeuroReport 12: 1243-1243 (C) 2001 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

In mouse, radiant heat tail-flick assay [Dmt(1)]DALDA produced profound spinal and supraspinal analgesia, being approximately 5000- and 100-fold more potent than morphine on a molar basis, respectively. When administered systemically, [Dmt(1)]DALDA was over 200-fold more potent than morphine. Pharmacologically, [Dmt(1)]DALDA was distinct from morphine. [Dmt(1)]DALDA displayed no cross-tolerance to morphine in the model used and it retained supraspinal analgesic activity in morphine-insensitive CXBK mice. Supraspinally, it also differed from morphine in its lack of sensitivity towards naloxonazine. Finally, in antisense mapping studies, [Dmt(1)]DALDA was insensitive to MOR-1 exon probes that reduced morphine analgesia, implying a distinct receptor mechanism of action. Thus, [Dmt(1)]DALDA is an interesting and extraordinarily potent, systemically active peptide analgesic, raising the possibility of novel approaches in the design of clinically useful drugs.

The purpose of our study was to determine what encodes the Xenopus oocyte's mechanosensitive cation channel. Based on the idea that homologues to known channels might contribute to the stretch channels, we screened a Xenopus oocyte cDNA library with cation channel probes. Whereas other screens were negative, P2X probes identified six isoforms of the P2X4 subtype of ATP-gated channels. From RNase protection assays and RT-PCR, we demonstrated that Xenopus oocytes express P2X4 mRNA. In expression studies, four isoforms produced functional ATP-gated ion channels; however, one, xP2X4c, had a conserved cysteine replaced by a tyrosine and failed to give rise to functional channels. By changing the tyrosine to a cysteine, we showed that this cysteine was crucial for function. We raised antibodies against a Xenopus P2X4 C-terminal peptide to investigate xP2X4 protein expression. This affinity purified anti-xP2X4 antibody recognized a 56 kDa glycosylated Xenopus P2X4 protein expressed in stably transfected HEK-293 cells and in P2X4 cDNA injected oocytes overexpressing the cloned P2X4 channels; however, it failed to recognize proteins in control, uninjected oocytes. This suggests that P2X4 channels and mechanosensitive cation channels are not linked. Instead, oocyte P2X4 mRNA may be part of the stored pool of stable maternal mRNA that remains untranslated until later developmental stages. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

However, until recently it has not been possible to test this hypothesis in the brains of living humans. Method: Unidirectional trapping of the 5-HT precursor analog alpha-[C-11]methyl-L-tryptophan (alpha-[C-11]MTrp) has been proposed as an index of 5-HT synthesis capacity. The authors measured brain regional alpha-[C-11]MTrp trapping with positron emission tomography in medication-free subjects with borderline personality disorder (N=13) and a healthy comparison group (N=11). Impulsivity was assessed by using a laboratory measure of behavioral disinhibition, go/no-go commission errors. Results: Compared to healthy men, the men with borderline personality disorder had significantly lower alpha-[C-11]MTrp trapping in corticostriatal sites, including the medial frontal gyrus, anterior cingulate gyrus, superior temporal gyrus, and corpus striatum. In the women with borderline personality disorder, significantly lower (alpha[C-11]MTrp trapping was seen in fewer regions, but in both men and women, negative correlations with impulsivity scores were identified in the medial frontal gyrus, anterior cingulate gyrus, temporal gyrus, and striatum. Conclusions: Low 5-HT synthesis capacity in corticostriatal pathways may contribute to the development of impulsive behaviors in persons with borderline personality disorder.

Objective: To assess its long-term clinical efficacy, 11 patients with disabling myoclonus due to progressive myoclonus epilepsy were treated with piracetam in an open-label study. Methods: Neurologic out-come (at the 1st, 6th, 12th, and 18th month of treatment) was assessed by an adjusted sum score of the following 3 indices: motor impairment, functional disability, and global assessment of disability due to myoclonus. Severity of other neurologic symptoms (seizure frequency and severity, dysarthria, and gait ataxia) also was assessed. Treatment with piracetam was initiated at a dose of 3.2 g/d that was gradually increased until stable benefit was noted (maximal dose in the trial was 20 g/d). Concomitant antiepileptic drugs were maintained at their previous dose. Results: Statistically significant improvement in the total rating score was observed after introduction of piracetam at the 1st, 6th, and 12th month of treatment. Severity of other neurologic symptom scores did not improve significantly. Two patients reported drowsiness during the first 2 weeks of treatment. Conclusions: Piracetam given as add-on therapy seems to be an effective, sustained, and well-tolerated treatment of myoclonus. In patients with progressive myoclonus epilepsy, the efficacy of the drug increased during the first 12 months of treatment and then stabilized.

This property can manifest itself with fractals (spatial scale invariance), flicker noise or 1/f-noise where f denotes the frequency of a signal (temporal scale invariance) and power laws (scale invariance in the size and duration of events in the dynamics of the system). A hypothesis recently put forward to explain these scale-free phenomomena is criticality, a notion introduced by physicists while studying phase transitions in materials, where systems spontaneously arrange themselves in an unstable manner similar, for instance, to a row of dominoes. Here, we review in a critical manner work which investigates to what extent this idea can be generalized to biology. More precisely, we start with a brief introduction to the concepts of absence of characteristic scale (power-law distributions, fractals and 1/f-noise) and of critical phenomena. We then review typical mathematical models exhibiting such properties: edge of chaos, cellular automata and self-organized critical models. These notions are then brought together to see to what extent they can account for the scale invariance observed in ecology, evolution of species, type III epidemics and some aspects of the central nervous system. This article also discusses how the notion of scale invariance can give important insights into the workings of biological systems.

We have used functional MRI to study the cortical mechanisms underlying this preserved somatosensory capacity. Nonpainful brushing and painful heat were applied to the skin of the legs in four hemispherectomized patients and, for comparison, in four normal subjects. Cortical activation was studied with a 1.5 T scanner using a BOLD (blood oxygen level dependent) protocol. All patients rated both the brushing and the heat pain as almost equally intense on each leg and the ratings were similar to those in normals. Brushing on the nonparetic leg activated primary and secondary somatosensory cortices (S1 and S2) in all patients, similar to findings in normals. Brushing on the paretic leg activated S1 in two patients and S2 in one of these patients. Heat pain activated S2, insular cortex and anterior cingulate cortex to a similar degree for both legs, but the activation was weaker in the patients than in the normals. For the individual patient, there was generally no obvious correlation between cortical activation as studied with the BOLD technique and psychophysical performance, The findings from tactile stimulation of the nonparetic leg, that the activation was similar to the contralateral activation in normals, suggest that tactile information processing in the hemisphere contralateral to the stimulation is independent of the corpus callosum, In contrast, the pain activation for the nonparetic leg was weaker than in normals, suggesting that pain activation in the hemisphere contralateral to the stimulation is dependent on transcallosal information processing, The latter finding was corroborated by a subnormal capacity for pain localization on the nonparetic foot in two of the patients. The findings from stimulation of the paretic leg show that areas typically involved in the processing of tactile and painful stimuli can be activated by ipsilateral pathways directly from the periphery. The tactile-evoked ipsilateral S1 activation may be due to subcortical reorganization, since it was not observed in the normal subjects.

The preference for consonance over dissonance was tested in a patient, I.R., who suffers from music perception and memory disorders as a result of bilateral lesions to the auditory cortex. In Experiment 1, I.R. was found to be unable to distinguish consonant from dissonant versions of musical excerpts taken from the classical repertoire by rating their pleasantness. I.R.'s indifference to dissonance was not due to a loss of all affective responses to music, however, since she rated the same excerpts as happy or sad, as normal controls do. In Experiment 2, I.R.'s lack of responsiveness to varying degrees of dissonance was replicated with chord sequences which had been used in a previous study using PET, in examining emotional responses to dissonance, A CT scan of I.R.'s brain was co-registered with the PET activation data from normal volunteers. Comparison of I.R.'s scan with the PET data revealed that the damaged areas overlapped with the regions identified to be involved in the perceptual analysis of the musical input, but not with the paralimbic regions involved in affective responses. Taken together, the findings suggest that dissonance may be computed bilaterally in the superior temporal gyri by specialized mechanisms prior to its emotional interpretation.

We compared the brain activation patterns during planning in Parkinson's disease patients and age-matched controls using (H2O)-O-15- PET and the Tower of London (TOL) task. In this study, our mildly affected Parkinson's disease group performed as well as the control group but showed a different pattern of neuronal activation. In the two groups, overlapping areas of the PFC were activated but, whereas the right caudate nucleus was activated in the control group, this was not evident in the Parkinson's disease patients. This suggests that normal normal frontal lobe activation can occur in Parkinson's disease despite abnormal processing within the basal ganglia. Moreover, right hippocampus activity was suppressed in the controls and enhanced in the Parkinson's disease patients. This could represent a shift to the declarative memory system in Parkinson's disease during performance of the TOL task, possibly resulting from insufficient working memory capacity within the frontostriatal system.

Methods-Randomised, double masked, aciclovir controlled, parallel group in 87 centres worldwide including 454 patients with ophthalmic tester of trigeminal nerve (V-1) comprised the intent to treat population. Oral famciclovir 500 mg three times daily or oral aciclovir 800 mg five times daily for 7 days. Assessments included day 0 (screening), days 3 and 7 (during treatment), days 10, 14, 21, 28 and monthly thereafter, up to 6 months (follow up). Proportion of patients who experienced ocular manifestations, severe manifestations and non-severe manifestations; loss of visual acuity was the main outcome measure. Results-The percentage of patients who experienced one or more ocular manifestations was similar for famciclovir (142/245, 58.0%) and aciclovir (114/196, 58.2%) recipients, with no significant difference between groups (OR 0.99; 95% CI 0.68, 1.45). The percentage of patients who experienced severe and non-severe manifestations was similar between groups, with no significant difference. The prevalence of individual ocular manifestations was comparable between groups. There was no significant difference between groups for visual acuity loss. Conclusion-Famciclovir 500 mg three times daily was well tolerated and demonstrated efficacy similar to aciclovir 800 mg five times daily.

Methods: In this randomized, double-blind, prospective study, patients (two groups, n = 30 each) received either 100 mg of lidocaine 5% in 7.5% glucose (Group L) or 100 mg of procaine 10% diluted with 1 ml cerebrospinal fluid (Group P). After spinal anesthesia, segmental level of sensory block was assessed by pinprick. Blood pressure and the height of the block were noted each minute for the first ten minutes. then every three minutes for the next 35 min and finally every live minutes until regression of the block to L4. Motor blockade was evaluated using the Bromage scale. To evaluate the presence of TRI, each patient was questioned 48 hr after surgery. Results: Time to highest sensory level and to maximum number of segments blocked showed no difference between groups. Mean time for sensory regression to T10 and for regression of the motor block were shorter in Group Fl Eighty minutes following injection, sensory levels were lower in Group Fl Five patients had inadequate surgical anesthesia in Group P and only one in Group L. No patient in Group P had TRI (95% CI 0-12 %) while eight (27%) in Group L did (95% CI 12-46%). Conclusions: Procaine 10% was associated with a clinical failure rate of 14.2%. This characteristic must be balanced against an absence of TRI, which occurs more frequently with the use of lidocaine 5%.

For the neurologist, involvement in such litigation most often takes place in the context of acting as an expert witness and, for the pediatric neurologist, the most common clinical situation for which expertise is requested is that of possible perinatal asphyxia. The medical expert's primary role is to provide necessary guidance and assistance to the court, which may permit the rendering of decisions that are scientifically valid. This article will review the attributes of the medical expert witness. Aspects of perinatal asphyxia cases under litigation that commonly require the assistance of pediatric neurology expertise such as etiology, timing, extent of disability and life expectancy will also be reviewed in detail. The aim is to provide for the neurologist a clearer understanding of the responsibilities inherent in this increasing professional role.

Patients and methods: CSF amine related compound levels and thiamine results were compared in 40 FA, 44 OPCA and nine ARSAC patients with those of 94 sex- and age-matched subjects. Neuroimaging (CT scans and single photon emission computed tomographies i.e. SPECT) were carried out in all patients and controls. Genetic studies were conducted on OPCA patients. CSF amine related compounds were measured by high performance liquid chromatography, whereas CSF thiamine levels were measured by a microbiological method. Results: FA patients had significantly lower CSF HVA, 5HIAA and thiamine values than control patients and a trend for lower MHPG levels. In OPCA patients, CSF HVA, MHPG and thiamine values were markedly lower whereas CSF 5HIAA values showed only a trend towards lower levels; in ARSAC patients only thiamine and HVA CSF values were lower than those in control subjects. Conclusion: After presenting the relationships between neurochemical findings on one side, the degree of ataxia, the degree of cerebellar atrophy and the SPECT findings on the other, the authors concluded that replacement and neuroprotective clinical trials in these patients would have to include two or three drugs because the neurotransmitter deficiencies are multiple.

Its etiology may be idiopathic (primary) or it may arise secondary to focal brain injury. Acute respiratory distress as a feature of such dystonias occurs infrequently. A review of the literature on Meige syndrome and the relationship between dystonias and respiratory compromise is presented. Methods: A 60-year-old woman suffered a cerebral anoxic event secondary to manual strangulation. She developed progressive blepharospasm combined with oromandibular and cervical dystonias. Neuroimaging demonstrated bilateral damage localized to the globus pallidus. Years later, she presented to the emergency department in intermittent respiratory distress associated with facial and cervical muscle spasms. Results: Increasing frequency and severity of the disorder was noted over years. The acute onset of respiratory involvement required intubation and eventual tracheotomy. A partial therapeutic benefit of tetrabenazine was demonstrated. Conclusion: This case highlights two interesting aspects of Meige's syndrome: (1) Focal bilateral basal ganglia lesions appear to be responsible for this patient's movement disorder which is consistent with relative overactivity of the direct pathway from striatum to globus pallidus internal and substantia nigra pars reticularis; (2) Respiratory involvement in a primarily craniofacial dystonia to the point of acute airway compromise.

Estimations were made for five concentrations of each of four different tastes, as well as for five ca rds of varying saturations of gray, which served as a control task. A cross-modal magnitude estimation procedure was employed in which subjects used distance on a measuring tape to reflect intensity estimation. Distances were then transformed into logs, and the slope and the correlation with stimulus concentration or saturation was calculated. Correlation was taken as a measure of accuracy of estimation and slope was taken as a measure of perceived intensity. As predicted, repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed a significant difference between the control group and both patient groups in taste intensity estimations, but not for grayness, reflecting the importance of the anterior temporal robe in low-level gustatory but not visual perception. Additionally, repeated measures ANOVA for slopes indicated that subjects in the right temporal group rated the bitter taste as more intense than did subjects in other groups, possibly reflecting increased intensity perception of the unpleasant bitter taste.

The 1924 study participants (> 70 years old) were randomly selected in the Saguenay-Lac Saint-Jean region (Quebec, Canada). The AD diagnosis was established in three steps according to recognized criteria. Sixty-eight cases were paired with a nondemented control for age (+/-2 years) and sex. Structured questionnaires addressed to subjects and proxy respondents allowed a description of the sociodemographic characteristics, lifestyle characteristics, and residential, occupational, familial, and medical histories. Assessment of environmental exposure to pesticides was based on residential histories and the agriculture census histories of Statistics Canada (1971-1991) for herbicide and insecticide spraying in the area. Statistical analyses were performed with a logistic regression, adjusting for potential confounding factors. The results failed to show a significant risk of AD with an exposure to herbicides, insecticides, and pesticides. However, future investigations are needed to establish more precisely the identification, measurement, mobility, and bioavailability of neurotoxic pesticide residues in relation to AD.

Recently, techniques have been developed that avoid circulatory arrest and maintain low-flow cerebral perfusion (LFCP) in an attempt to avoid the potential neurological sequelae associated with DHCA. We describe a technique of LFCP that avoids circulatory arrest and direct cannulation of the arch vessels. Five patients underwent reconstruction of the aortic arch with concomitant biventricular intracardiac repair. The distal ascending aorta was cannulated and patients were systemically cooled. The cannula was advanced into the innominate artery and snared in place prior to opening and reconstructing the aorta with continuous LFCP. In all five patients, we completely avoided circulatory arrest and direct cannulation of the arch vessels. All patients survived and there were no adverse neurological outcomes.

L-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) was slowly injected until long-latency, long-lasting discharges could be evoked by the stimulation of contralateral flexor reflex afferents (coFRA) and the group I autogenetic inhibition was reversed to polysynaptic excitation in extensor motoneurons. Under these conditions, we stimulated in alternation the contralateral pyramidal tract (PT), group I afferents from knee and ankle extensor muscles, and both stimuli together. We did the same for the stimulation of PT and of coFRA. Clear polysynaptic EPSPs could be evoked from all three sources in 32 extensor motoneurons. Convergence was inferred from spatial facilitation, which occurred when the amplitude of the EPSPs evoked by the combined stimuli was notably larger than the algebraic sum of the EPSPs evoked by individual stimulation. Spatial facilitation was found between PT and extensor group I inputs in 30/59 tests (51%) in 20 motoneurons and in all cases (6/6) between PT and coFRA in six motoneurons. When fictive locomotion was induced with further injection of L-DOPA, PT descending volleys from the same stimulating site could reset the stepping rhythm by initiating bursts of activity in all extensors. These results indicate that at least some of the corticospinal fibers project onto interneurons shared by the coFRA and the polysynaptic excitatory group I pathways to extensors. The implications of such convergence patterns on the organization of the extensor "half-center" for locomotion are discussed.

Clinical evaluation is difficult in the setting of unstable, often intubated patients. A screening tool may improve the detection of delirium. Method: We created a screening checklist of eight items based on DSM criteria and features of delirium: altered level of consciousness, inattention, disorientation, hallucination or delusion, psychomotor agitation or retardation, inappropriate mood or speech, sleep/wake cycle disturbance, and symptom fluctuation. During 3 months, all patients admitted to a busy medical/surgical intensive care unit were evaluated, and the scale score was compared to a psychiatric evaluation. Results: In 93 patients studied, 15 developed delirium. Fourteen (93%) of them had a score of 4 points or more. This score was also present in 15 (19%) of patients without delirium, 14 of whom had a known psychiatric illness, dementia, a structural neurological abnormality or encephalopathy. A ROC analysis was used to determine the sensitivity and specificity of the screening tool. The area under the ROC curve is 0.9017. Predicted sensitivity is 99% and specificity is 64%. Conclusion: This study suggests that the Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist can easily be applied by a clinician or a nurse in a busy critical care setting to screen all patients even when communication is compromised. The tool can be utilized quickly and helps to identify delirious patients. Earlier diagnosis may lead to earlier intervention and better patient care.

Methods and Materials: From 1987 to 1996, 21 patients, 10 males and II females, median age of-II years (range: 7-75 years), with an intracerebral AOVM underwent stereotactic radiosurgery at our institution. All were considered at high risk for surgical intervention. The vascular lesions were located in the brainstem (17 patients), basal ganglia (2), occipital lobe (1), and cerebellum (1), Diagnosis was based on high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Clinical presentation at onset included previous intracerebral hemorrhage (20 patients) and epilepsy (1). All patients were treated with a linac-based radiosurgical technique. The median dose delivered was 25 Gy (range 13-50 Gy), typically prescribed to the 80-90% isodose surface (range 50-90%), which corresponded to the periphery of the vascular malformation. Patients were followed by clinical neurologic assessment and by MRI on a regular interval basis. Results: Follow-up was obtained in 20 patients; clinical or MRI information was not available for 1 patient, and this patient was excluded from our analysis. At a median follow-up of 77 months (range: 4-141 months), follow-up MRIs postradiosurgery do not demonstrate any changes in the appearance of the AOVM. Four patients developed an intracranial bleed at 4, 8, 35, and 57 months postradiosurgery, Annual hemorrhage rates were considerably higher in the observation period preradiosurgery than postradiosurgery (30% vs. 3.2%,p < 0.001). Complications postradiosurgery were observed in 4 patients. Three patients developed mild to moderate edema surrounding the radiosurgical target, expressed at 5, 8, and 24 months, respectively. In all cases, the edema was transient and resolved completely on subsequent MRIs. One of the 4 patients developed radiation necrosis 8 months after radiosurgery, Conclusion: The use of stereotactic radiosurgery in the treatment of AOVM continues to be controversial. Our results appear to show a reduction in the risk of symptomatic hemorrhage post treatment. Patients with previous history of hemorrhage or progressive neurologic deficit and small, well circumscribed lesions may benefit from a trial of stereotactic radiosurgery.

This work was aimed at identifying the possible role of protein glycosylation in the brain from patients with Alzheimer disease (AD), using lectin histochemistry, as determinants of reactive plasticity. Results indicate an increase in the production of cryptic O-glycosidically linked proteins (NeuAc alpha2,6 Gal beta1,3GalNA alpha1.0 Ser/Thr or sialyl-T-antigen) in neuritic sprouting in AD brains as determined by positive labeling with Amaranthus leucocarpus (ALL, T-antigen-specific) and Macrobrachium rosenbergii (MRL, specific for NeuAc5,9Ac(2)) lectins. Immunohistochemistry indicated that lectin staining was specific for the synaptic sprouting process (megancurites) in AD. These results were confirmed using anti-synaptophysin and anti-GAP 43 antibodies, which recognized megancurites and dystrophic neurites around amyloid-beta deposits. In normal control brains, labeling with the aforementioned lectins was restricted to microvessels. Control experiments with neurarninidase-treated brain samples revealed positivity to the lectin front Arachis hypogaea (PNA), which is specific fur galactose. Our results suggest specific O-glycosylation patterns of proteins closely related to neuronal plasticity in AD.

The authors have identified an ontogenically determined pattern of enteric NO neural maturation that may render the distal gut of premature piglets susceptible to injury. Methods: NO synthase (cNOS and iNOS) activities were measured in the developing piglet gut wall and compared with gut from an intraluminal model of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) at different times. Results: in premature animals, iNOS activity was significantly higher 3 hours after NEC induction compared with similarly treated 8-day-old piglets. iNOS levels continued to rise 6 hours after NEC induction in prematures. Premature animals (labor induced by prostaglandins) failed to show such a rise in iNOS. In 3 day olds, iNOS levels increased significantly 16 hours after injury compared with the 3-hour group. Conclusions: iNOS production increases in premature piglets with NEC compared with full-term NEC animals and continues to rise in the presence of intestinal damage regardless of developmental status. Maternal administration of prostaglandins attenuates this rise in iNOS activity. Elevated NO production in premature gut may contribute to increased susceptibility to damage in NEC.

JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY & NEUROSCIENCE			English	Review							GROWTH-HORMONE SECRETION; LOW-DOSE APOMORPHINE; LONG-TERM TREATMENT; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; SUBCUTANEOUS APOMORPHINE; MOTOR FLUCTUATIONS; ANTIPSYCHOTIC-DRUGS; RECEPTOR AGONIST; SUBLINGUAL APOMORPHINE; PROLACTIN SECRETION	The dopamine (DA) hypothesis of schizophrenia implicates an enhancement of DA function in the pathophysiology of the disorder, at least in the genesis of positive symptoms. Accordingly, apomorphine, a directly acting DA receptor agonist, should display psychotomimetic properties. A review of the literature shows little or no evidence that apomorphine, in doses that stimulate postsynaptic DA receptors, induces psychosis in nonschizophrenic subjects or a relapse or exacerbation of psychotic symptoms in patients with schizophrenia. After a detailed review of the literature reporting psychotogenic effects of apomorphine in patients with Parkinson's disease, an interpretation of these data is difficult, in part because of several confounding factors, such as the concomitant use of drugs known to induce psychosis and the advanced state of the progressive neurological disorder. In the context of the DA hypothesis of schizophrenia, the limited ability of apomorphine to induce psychosis, in contrast to indirectly acting DA agonists that increase synaptic DA, may be explained by the relatively weak affinity of apomorphine for the D, receptor compared with DA. Alternatively, enhancement of DA function, though necessary, may be insufficient by itself to induce psychosis.

Materials and Methods: From 1992 to 1998, 15 male and 5 female patients with spins bifida (age 13.3 +/- 3.8 years) underwent endoscopic collagen injection for the treatment of urinary incontinence secondary to sphincter deficiency. Mean followup was 4.2 years. Pretreatment urodynamic study showed a stable compliant bladder with an average leak point pressure of 52 cm. H2O (range 23 to 100). Concurrent medical management included anticholinergics in 15 cases, agonists in 3, and clean intermittent catheterization in 16. Five patients had undergone previous ileocystoplasty. Results: Collagen injections were given with the patient under general anesthesia. The number of injections was 1 in 5 cases, 2 in 11, 3 in 3, and 4 in 1. Average collagen volume injected per treatment was 6.6 cc (range 2 to 13). All patients were evaluated on a subjective continence scale of no change (wet), improved or completely dry at the time of assessment. Of the 20 patients, 16 had no change, 3 showed improvement and 1 was dry. Initial improvement in the first 2 months after injection deteriorated thereafter in 16 cases. Conclusions: The previously reported high success rate of collagen injection is not supported by this study. With long-term followup collagen injection is rarely effective for treating urinary incontinence in children with neurogenic sphincter deficiency.

Detrusor hyperreflexia is believed to be mediated by afferent C fibers with tachykinins as neurotransmitters. We investigated the selective peptide tachykinin antagonists MEN 11420 and GR 82334 of NK-2 and NK-1 receptors, respectively, in a chronic rat model of detrusor hyperreflexia after suprasacral spinal cord injury. Materials and Methods: Adult female Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 200 to 250 gm. were used. The spinal cord was transected at the T10 level. The bladder was evacuated by the Crede maneuver 3 times daily. After 6 weeks the rats were implanted with femoral vein and bladder dome catheters 2 days before filling cystometry. The 5 rats in group 1 received 100 nmol./kg. of the NK-2 antagonist MEN 11420 intravenously. The 5 rats in group 2 received 100 nmol./kg. of the NK-1 antagonist GR 82334 intravenously. The 5 rats in group 3 received a combination of the same dose of each antagonist. Three repetitive micturition cycles were recorded before injection. Three micturition cycles were done 20 minutes after the injection of each antagonist. Mean cystometric parameters were reported, including bladder capacity, micturition pressure, baseline pressure, post-void residual urine curd micturition volume, and the number and amplitude of hyperreflexic contractions greater than 15 cm. water. Results: MEN 11420 significantly reduced the frequency of hyperreflexic contractions and baseline bladder pressure (p < 0.05). There was no statistically significant effect on the other cystometric parameters. GR 82334 reduced the amplitude of hyperreflexic contractions but not statistically significant. A combination of MEN 11420 and GR 82334 significantly reduced the frequency and amplitude of hyperreflexic contractions (p <0.05) with no significant effects on other cystometric parameters, although there was a tendency toward increased micturition volume and bladder capacity. Conclusions: These results suggest that at the peripheral level there is an efferent role of tachykinins in detrusor hyperreflexia after spinal cord injury. NK-1 and NK-2 receptor selective antagonists reduced the frequency and amplitude of hyperreflexic contractions as well as baseline bladder pressure. This finding may lead to potential new therapeutic modalities using selective tachykinins antagonists with other pharmacological agents to combat detrusor hyperreflexia.

The Apror protein is present in peripheral neuronal processes and ganglionic neuropil, implicating the kinase in the regulation of growth and/or synaptic events. In cultured bag-cell neurons, the majority of the protein is stored in intracellular organelles, whereas only a small fraction is expressed on the surface, When expressed on the cell surface, the protein is clustered on neurites, suggesting that Apror is involved in the organization of functional domains within neurons. Apror immunoreactivity partially colocalizes with the P-type calcium channel BC-alpha 1A at bag-cell neuron varicosities, suggesting a role for Apror in organizing neuropeptide release sites.

Neurotransmitters are released from synaptic vesicles in presynaptic neurons in response to neural activity, diffuse across the synaptic cleft, and bind specific receptors in order to bring about changes in postsynaptic neurons, Some of the molecular processes that govern neurotransmitter release are now becoming better understood. The steps involved can be broken down into two partially overlapping presynaptic cycles, the neurotransmitter cycle and the synaptic Vesicle cycle. The neurotransmitter cycle involves transmitter biosynthesis, storage, reuptake, and degradation. The synaptic vesicle cycle involves targeting to the nerve terminal, docking, fusion, endocytosis, and recycling, Biochemical and structural studies have yielded important insight into our understanding of each of these two cycles. Further, both pharmacological and genetic interference with either of these cycles results in profound alterations in synaptic transmission and behavior, demonstrating the crucial role of neurotransmitter release.

More amenable to parallel computation, they are much faster than the nearest neighbor classifier (NN), which, however. has distinctly outperformed them in several applications. The purpose of this study is to investigate a condensed neural network that combines the classification speed of neural networks and the low error rate of the nearest neighbor classifier. This condensed network is a fast, accurate classifier of simple architecture and function: it consists of a set of generalized perceptrons that draw maximal hyperspherical boundaries centered on patterns of memory units, each circumscribing reference patterns of a single category. The generalized perceptrons carry out classification, assisted by sporadic nearest neighbor matching to patterns of a small reference set. We compare the condensed network to a high performance neural network pattern classifier (Kohonen) and to NN in experiments on hand-printed character recognition (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

In order to provide end users with a rational basis for selecting a given algorithm for a specific neuroscientific application, we evaluated the performance of six NUC algorithms. We used simulated and real MRI data volumes, including six repeat scans of the same subject, in order to rank the accuracy, precision, and stability of the nonuniformity corrections. We also compared algorithms using data volumes from different subjects and different (1.5T and 3.0T) MRI scanners in order to relate differences in algorithmic performance to intersubject variability and/or differences in scanner performance. In phantom studies, the correlation of the extracted with the applied nonuniformity was highest in the transaxial (left-to-right) direction and lowest in the axial. (top-to-bottom) direction. Two of the six algorithms demonstrated a high degree of stability, as measured by the iterative application of the algorithm to its corrected output. While none of the algorithms performed ideally under all circumstances, locally adaptive methods generally outperformed nonadaptive methods. (C) 2001 Academic Press.

Trials comprised an initial "prospect" (expectancy) phase, when a set of three monetary amounts was displayed, and a subsequent "outcome" phase, when one of these amounts was awarded. Hemodynamic responses in the sublenticular extended amygdala (SLEA) and orbital gyrus tracked the expected values of the prospects, and responses to the highest value set of outcomes increased monotonically with monetary value in the nucleus accumbens, SLEA, and hypothalamus. Responses to prospects and outcomes were generally, but not always, seen in the same regions. The overlap of the observed activations with those seen previously in response to tactile stimuli, gustatory stimuli, and euphoria-inducing drugs is consistent with a contribution of common circuitry to the processing of diverse rewards.

The present aim was to elucidate the contributions of the accumbens core and medial shell to these effects. In the first experiment, rats received bilateral intra-accumbens infusion of the dopaminergic antagonist eticlopride (or saline) prior to saline or nicotine (0.2 mg/kg s.c.) challenge. Eticlopride inhibited basal and nicotine induced locomotor activity more effectively when infused into the core (0.0625-0.5 mug/side) than into the medial shell (0.5-1 mug/side). In a second experiment, rats received 6-hydroxydopamine infused into the core or medial shell, and were subsequently tested with saline, nicotine (0.2 mg/kg s.c.) and D-amphetamine (0.75 mg/kg s.c.). Residual dopaminergic innervation was assessed by autoradiographic [I-125]RTI-55 labelling of the dopamine transporter. [I-125]RTI-55 labelling in the accumbens core was positively correlated with the locomotor stimulant effects of both nicotine and D-amphetamine. In contrast, [I-125]RTI-55 labelling in the medial shell was associated negatively with amphetamine induced activity. Recent evidence suggests that dopamine release in the medial shell may mediate the reinforcing effect of nicotine and D-amphetamine. In contrast, the present findings suggest that dopamine release in the core subregion contributes preferentially to the locomotor stimulant effects of nicotine and D-amphetamine.

Initial trials conducted in depressed patients using regimens of 20 mg/day or less did not convincingly demonstrate its efficacy as an antidepressant. The aim of this study was to assess thr effects of duloxetine on the 5-HT arm NE reuptake processes in healthy human volunteers. Twenty-seven healthy young males without a history of psychiatric disorder were randomly assigned to four groups, each group receiving one of the following daily drug regimens: placebo, clomipramine (a potent 5-HT/NE reuptake blocker) 100 mg/day, duloxetine 20 mg/day, or duloxetine 60 mg/day. In order to assess the NE reuptake process, the pressor response to intravenous tyramine (4 and 6 mg) teas measured. Determination of the whole blood 5-HT con tent seas used to evaluate the 5-HT reuptake blockade. These measurements were performed at baseline and repeated after 7 and 14 days of drug intake. Both duloxetine, at doses of 20 to 60 mg/day, and clomipramine significantly interfered with the 5-HT reuptake process, as demonstrated by marked decreases in blood 5-HT concentrations. However, the same doses of duloxetine, unlike clomipramine,failed to impede the usual increase in blood pressure that follows a tyramine intravenous infusion, indicating that clomipramine but not duloxetine blocked NE reuptake. At doses tested in a population of healthy volunteers, duloxetine acted as a selective 5-HT reuptake inhibitor, having no clear effect on the NE reuptake process. Nevertheless, given that the highest dose of duloxetine increased supine systolic blood pressure, it is possible that if represents the threshold regimen for NE reuptake inhibition.

A search of the world literature published since 1966 reveals at least six cases of mycotic carotid aneurysms due to a Salmonella septicemia. We present an exceptional case of mycotic pseudoaneurysm of the bifurcation of the carotid artery due to Salmonella septicemia and discuss the pathogenesis as well as various aspects of the diagnosis and surgical management. CLINICAL PRESENTATION: A 68-year-old man presented in Poland with Salmonella sepsis; 1 month later, he was admitted to the emergency department of the Sir Mortimer B, Davis-Jewish General Hospital in Montreal with a bulky and pulsatile right cervical mass. An angiogram and a computed tomographic scan revealed a voluminous and partially thrombosed aneurysm the size of a tangerine originating from the posterior aspect of the carotid junction. INTERVENTION: Balloon trapping was attempted at the Montreal Neurological Hospital. Subsequently, the patient developed a significant neurological deficit, which was quickly reversed by the administration of hypertensive, hypervolemic, and hemodilution therapy. Thereafter, the pseudoaneurysm was resected surgically, and the internal and external carotid arteries were sacrificed. Pathological examination of the excised specimen of the carotid junction revealed a pseudoaneurysm. Bacterial culture of the lesion showed growth of Salmonella. CONCLUSION: The postoperative course was satisfactory except for laryngeal paralysis due to involvement of the vagus nerve. Four months later, a computed tomographic scan showed only small lacunae in both centra semiovale.

[I-125]ITIPP(psi) was obtained, via electrophilic iodination, in 46% yield (>44,000 MBq/mu mol) from the parent TIPP(psi). The biodistribution of [I-125]ITIPP(psi) in nu/nu mice bearing SCLC-SW210.5 xenographs revealed good uptake and prolonged retention of radioactivity in organs known to possess delta -opioid receptors. Metabolite analysis showed that [I-125]ITIPP(psi) was largely unmetabolized at 25 min PI and blocking studies showed significant reduction of uptake of the tracer in the brain, liver, intestine and tumor indicating that the iodinated tetrapeptide binds to delta opioid receptors in vivo.

J	Baker, CL				Baker, CL			Linear filtering and nonlinear interactions in direction-selective visual cortex neurons: A noise correlation analysis	VISUAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						visual cortex; direction selectivity; lagged cells; white noise analysis; neural modeling	CAT STRIATE CORTEX; LATERAL GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; CELL RECEPTIVE-FIELDS; COMPLEX CELLS; SPATIOTEMPORAL ORGANIZATION; MOTION; STIMULI; AREA-18; INPUT; TIME	Spatial and temporal properties related to direction selectivity of both simple and complex type visual cortex neurons were assessed by cross-correlation analysis of their responses to random ternary white noise. This stimulus consisted of multiple randomly placed bars, each colored white, black, or gray with equal probability, which were rerandomized every 5-10 ms. A first-order cross-correlation analysis of a neuron's spike train with the spatiotemporal history of the stimulus provided an estimate of the neuron's linear spatiotemporal filtering properties. A nonlinear correlation analysis measured the amount of interaction for pair-wise combinations of bars as a function of their relative spatial and temporal separations. The spatiotemporal orientation of each of these functions was quantified using a "motion energy index" (MEI), which was compared to the neurons' direction selectivity measured with drifting sinewave gratings. Both first-order and nonlinear correlation plots usually showed s-t orientation whose sign was consistent with the neuron's direction preference; however, in many cases the MEI for first-order analysis was weak compared to that seen in the nonlinear interactions. The structures of the nonlinear interaction functions were also compared with predictions from a conventional model of direction selectivity based on a simple spatiotemporally oriented linear filter, followed by an intensive nonlinearity ("LN model"). These comparisons showed that some neurons' data agreed reasonably well with such a model, while others agreed poorly or not at all. Simulations of an alternative model which combines signals from idealized lagged and nonlagged front-end linear filters produce noise correlation results more like those seen in the neurophysiological data.

Both types I (mineralocorticoid) and II (glucocorticoid) receptors (MR and GR, respectively) participate in corticosteroid-induced transcriptional repression of the 5-HT1A gene; however, the precise mechanism is unclear. A direct repeat 6-base pair glucocorticoid response element (GRE) half site 5'-TGTCCT separated by 6 nucleotides was conserved in human, mouse, and rat 5-HT1A receptor promoters. In SN-48 neuronal cells that express MR, GR, and 5-HT1A receptors, deletion or inactivation of the nGRE (negative GRE) eliminated negative regulation of the rat 5-HT1A or heterologous promoters by corticosteroids, whereas its inclusion conferred corticosteroid-induced inhibition to a heterologous promoter. Bacterially expressed recombinant MR and GR preferentially bound to the nGRE as a heterodimer, as identified in nuclear extracts of MR/GR-transfected COS-7 cells, and with higher affinity than MR or GR homodimers. In SN48 and COS-7 cells, concentration-dependent coactivation of MR and GR was required for maximal inhibitory action by corticosteroids and was abrogated in the L501P-GR mutant lacking DNA binding activity. Corticosteroid-mediated transcriptional inhibition was greater for MR/GR in combination than for MR or GR alone. These data represent the first identification of an nMRE/GRE and indicate that heterodimerization of MR and GR mediates direct corticosteroid-induced transrepression of the 5-HT1A receptor promoter.

Metabolic labeling, immunoprecipitation, and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis reveal that pro-BDNF is generated as a 32-kDa precursor that is N-glycosylated and glycosulfated on a site, within the pro-domain. Some pro-BDNF is released extracellularly and is biologically active as demonstrated by its ability to mediate TrkB phosphorylation, The precursor undergoes N-terminal cleavage within the trans-Golgi network and/or immature secretory vesicles to generate mature BDNF (14 kDa), Small amounts of a 28-kDa protein that is immunoprecipitated with BDNF antibodies is also evident. This protein is generated in the endoplasmic reticulum through N-terminal cleavage of pro-BDNF at the Arg-Gly-Leu-Thr(57)- down arrow -Ser-Leu site. Cleavage is abolished when Arg(54) is changed to Ala (R54A) by in vitro mutagenesis. Blocking generation of 28-kDa BDNF has no effect on the level of mature BDNF and blocking generation of mature BDNF with alpha (1)-PDX, an inhibitor of furin-like enzymes, does not lead to accumulation of the 28-kDa form. These data suggest that 28-kDa pro-BDNF is not an obligatory intermediate in the formation of the 14-kDa form in the constitutive secretory pathway.

In our previous studies, heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) prolonged viability of cultured motor neurons expressing mutant human SOD-l and reduced formation of aggregates. in this paper, we report that mutant SOD-l proteins have altered solubility in cells relative to wild-type SOD-l and can form a direct association with HSP70 and other stress proteins. Whereas wild-type human and endogenous mouse SOD-1 were detergent-soluble, a portion of mutant SOD-l was detergent-insoluble in protein extracts of NIH3T3 transfected with SOD-l gene constructs, spinal cord cultures established from G93A SOD-1 transgenic mouse embryos, and lumbar spinal cord from adult G93A transgenic mice. A direct association of HSP70, HSP40, and alphaB-crystallin with mutant SOD-1 (G93A or G41S), but not wild-type or endogenous mouse SOD-1, was demonstrated by coimmunoprecipitation, Mutant SOD-1 HSP70 complexes were predominantly in the detergent-insoluble fraction. However, only a small percentage of total cellular mutant SOD-l was detergent-insoluble, suggesting that mutation-induced alteration of protein conformation may not in itself be sufficient for direct interaction with heat shock proteins.

In an attempt to provide a morphological substrate for the above phenomena, we applied Light and electron microscopic immunocytochemistry to investigate the pattern of SP innervation of blood vessels and its relationship to mast cells in the skin of the rat lower lip. Furthermore, we examined the distribution of SP (neurokinin-1) receptors and their relationship to SP-immunoreactive (LR) fibers. Our results confirmed that SP-IR fibers are found in cutaneous nerves and that terminal branches are observed around blood vessels and penetrating the epidermis. SP-IR fibers also innervated hair follicles and sebaceous glands. At the ultrastructural level, SP-IR varicosities were observed adjacent; to arterioles, capillaries, venules, and mast cells. The varicosities possessed both dense core vesicles and agranular synaptic vesicles. We quantified the distance between SP-IR varicosities and blood vessel endothelial cells. Sla-IR terminals were located within 0.23-5.99 mum from the endothelial cell layer in 82.7% of arterioles, in 90.2% of capillaries, and in 86.9% of venules. Although there was a trend for SP-IR fibers to be located closer to the endothelium of venules, this difference was not significant. Neurokinin-1 receptor (NK-lr) immunoreactivity was most abundant in the upper dermis and was associated with the wall of blood vessels. NK-lr were located in equal amounts on the walls of arterioles, capillaries, and venules that were innervated by SP-IR fibers. The present results favor the concept of a participation of SP in cutaneous neurogenic vasodilatation and plasma extravasation both by an action on blood vessels after binding to the NK-lr and by causing the release of substances from mast cells after diffusion through the connective tissue.

Unitary inhibitory postsynaptic currents (uIPSCs) were characterised between 23 synaptically coupled interneurones at the border of stratum radiatum and lacunosum-moleclare (LM) and CA1 pyramidal cells (PYR) using dual whole-cell recordings and morphological identification in rat hippocampal slices. 2. LM interneurones presented a morphology typical of stellate cells, with a fusiform soma as well as dendritic and axonal arborisations in stratum radiatum and lacunosum-moleculare. 3. Single spikes in interneurones triggered uIPSCs in pyramidal cells that were blocked by the GABAA antagonist bicuculline and mediated by a chloride conductance. The latency, rise time, duration and decay time constant of uIPSCs were a function of amplitude in all pairs, suggesting a homogeneity in the population sampled. 4. During paired pulse stimulation, individual LM-PYR connections exhibited facilitation or depression. The paired pulse ratio was inversely related to the amplitude of the first response. The transition from facilitation to depression occurred at 26 % of the maximal amplitude of the first uIPSC. Paired pulse depression was not modified by CGP 55845 and thus was GABA(B) receptor independent. 5. CGP 55845 failed to modify the amplitude of uIPSCs, suggesting an absence of tonic presynaptic GABA(B) inhibition at LM-PYR connections. B. Increasing G;ABA release by repetitive activation of interneurones failed to induce GABAB IPSCs. With extracellular minimal stimulation, increasing stimulation intensity above threshold, or repetitive activation, evoked GABA(B) IPSCs, probably as a result of coactivation of several GABAergic fibres. 7. Thus, dendritic inhibition by LM interneurones involves GABA(A) uIPSCs with kinetics dependent on response amplitude and subject to GABA(B)-independent paired pulse plasticity.

Trigeminal ganglia were excised post mortem from five human subjects. Oligonucleotide primers were selected based upon unique regions of complementary DNA sequence for the cloned human 5-HT7 receptor. Sequence analysis revealed the presence of a single message that matched the sequence of the cloned human 5-HT7 receptor.

Addition of the anticholinesterase eserine (10 muM) depressed the amplitude (by 29.5 +/- 6.6%, n = 13) and duration (by 26.3 +/- 4.7%, n = 11) of the evoked field potentials in 13/19 slices (68%), and increased significantly the rates of occurrence of spontaneous epileptiform discharges or induced them in 9/19 slices (47%). All these effects were blocked by the muscarinic antagonist atropine (2.5 muM, n = 3), suggesting that they were mediated by the activation of muscarinic receptors by endogenous acetylcholine. The cholinergic inhibitory effect is unlikely to terminate seizures, while the excitatory effect, could conceivably promote or aggravate their manifestation. In conclusion, these findings demonstrate that endogenous acetylcholine may contribute to epileptogenesis in immature neocortex. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Methods: The authors report two new cases and summarize the literature of childhood IACNS confirmed by pathology. Results: IACNS affecting small vessels (n = 5)-Neurologic manifestations included headaches, focal seizures, and progressive, behavioral, or multifocal neurologic impairment. MRI showed multifocal, Ta-hyperintense, cerebral lesions without mass effect or tumor-like lesions. CSF, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and cerebral angiograms were often normal. CNS biopsy disclosed a nongranulomatous vasculitis. Children were treated with prednisone alone or combined with cyclophosphamide. One child died. Four children had a favorable outcome. IACNS affecting large and medium arteries (n = 5)-Three children presented with acute ischemic stroke or TIA. Brain CT showed ischemic infarcts. Two children presented with subarachnoid hemorrhage. In this group, CSF, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and angiograms were often abnormal. No patient received immunosuppressive therapy. Five children died. Autopsy showed granulomatous IACNS (n = 5) Conclusions: Clinical and radiologic features correlate with the size of affected vessels. Prognosis differs between groups. Potential markers of poor outcome are acute stroke presentation secondary to large and medium-sized artery involvement, granulomatous angiitis, and delayed institution of immunosuppressive therapy.

As this variant is not known to be functional, we searched for other markers within the coding reg-ion, using single-strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP) analysis. We have identified three polymorphic sites localized in three different exons of the PLC-gamma1 gene (exons 9, 26, 31). Variation studies of these potentially functional sites in a group of 133 bipolar patients with an excellent response to lithium prophylaxis and a comparison group of 99 healthy controls showed no difference in genotype distributions for exon 9 (chi-square = 1.41, df = 2, P = 0.49), exon 26 (chi-square = 2.26, df = 2, P = 0.13), or exon 31 (chi-square = 1.41, df = 2, P = 0.49). Similar results were observed for allele distributions. These results suggest that our previous findings were not the result of linkage disequilibrium with these variants. (C) 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Following the recent identification of the beta -secretase beta -amyloid-converting enzyme (BACE), we herein investigate its zymogen processing, molecular properties, and cellular trafficking. Our data show that among the proprotein convertase family members, furin is the major converting enzyme of pro-BACE into BACE within the trans-Golgi network of HK293 cells. While we demonstrate that; the 24-amino acid prosegment is required for the efficient exit of pro-BACE from the endoplasmic reticulum, it may not play a strong inhibitory role since we observe that pro-BACE can produce significant quantities of the Swedish mutant beta APP(sw) beta -secretase product C99, BACE is palmitoylated at three Cys residues within its transmembrane/cytosolic tail and is sulfated at mature N-glycosylated moieties, Data with three different antibodies show that a small fraction of membrane-bound BACE is shed into the medium and that the extent of ectodomain shedding is palmitoylation-dependent. Overexpression of full-length BACE causes a significant increase in the production of C99 and a decrease in the alpha -secretase product APPs alpha. Although there is little increase in the generation of A beta by full-length BACE, overexpression of either a soluble form of BACE (equivalent to the shed form) or one lacking the prosegment leads to enhanced A beta levels. These findings suggest that the shedding of BACE may play a role in the amyloidogenic processing of beta APP.

The peptidic delta opioid-receptor agonist [D-penicillamine(2,5)]-enkephalin (DPDPE) is a substrate of mdr1aP-gp and Oatp2. The present study evaluated the influence of these transporters on brain uptake of DPDPE by in situ perfusion in mice. Brain uptake was increased similar to 12-fold in mice lacking P-gp in the BBB, but the P-gp inhibitor dexverapamil did not increase uptake in P-gp-competent mice. In P-gp-deficient mice, DPDPE uptake was saturable (K-m similar to 24 mM), and was inhibited by dexverapamil and the Oatp2 substrates digoxin, estradiol-17 beta -glucuronide and fexofenadine. These results confirm P-gp-mediated efflux of DPDPE, and suggest functional uptake transport of DPDPE by Oatp, at the murine BBB. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

The agrin signaling pathway involves tyrosine phosphorylation of the AChR beta subunit, and we have tested its role in receptor localization by expressing tagged, tyrosine-minus forms of the beta subunit in mouse So18 myotubes. We find that agrin-induced phosphorylation of the beta subunit occurs only on cell surface AChR, and that AChR-containing tyrosine-minus beta subunit is targeted normally to the plasma membrane. Surface AChR that is tyrosine phosphorylated is less detergent extractable than nonphosphorylated AChR. indicating that it is preferentially linked to the cytoskeleton. Consistent with this, we find that agrin treatment reduces the detergent extractability of AChR that contains tagged wild-type beta subunit but not tyrosine-minus beta subunit. In addition, agrin-induced clustering of AChR containing tyrosine-minus beta subunit is reduced in comparison to wild-type receptor. Thus. we find that agrin-induced phosphorylation of AChR beta subunit regulates cytoskeletal anchoring and contributes to the clustering of the AChR, and this is likely to play an important role in the postsynaptic localization of the receptor at the developing synapse.

Factors regulating the expression of membrane (m)VCAM and its cleaved counterpart soluble (s)VCAM are poorly understood. We previously demonstrated that serum sVCAM levels are increased in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients treated with interferon beta 1b (IFN beta 1b), which correlated with a reduction in gadolinium enhancing lesions on magnetic resonance imaging. However, subsequent studies have shown that IFN beta does not directly induce VCAM expression on endothelial cells. We demonstrate here that co-culture with IFN beta -conditioned T cells induces mVCAM on human brain endothelial cells (HBEC). Further, rapid shedding of sVCAM occurs, which mirrors the response after in vivo IFN beta treatment. The VCAM induction is mediated partially through tumor necrosis factor (TNF)alpha and can be abrogated by sTNF receptor. VCAM could also be induced on astroglioma lines using IFN beta -conditioned T cells, which suggests the effect is not specific for HBEC. Kinetic studies demonstrated an increase in the sVCAM to mVCAM ratio over time, which may contribute to the ultimate therapeutic effect of IFN beta in patients. These data have important implications for understanding the events occurring at the blood brain barrier in vivo, and for determining the mechanism of action of IFN beta in MS.

Methods: In addition to manual searches, Medline, Current Contents and Psych Info databases were searched for relevant publications. Results: On the evidence of an extensive body of research, so far biological correlates of social phobia remain elusive. Furthermore, the majority of studies reveal by default that the neurobiological functioning of social phobics is very much like that of normal control subjects. Conclusion: The conceptual and methodological foundations underpinning the current research programme are discussed critically. Its main weaknesses were found to be: lack of theory to guide research and aid the interpretation of results, static comparisons between subject groups and analysis oblivious to great individual variations. Possibilities of alternative approaches to study the neurobiology of social phobia are raised. Among others, continuous and situation-specific measurement, subjects used as their own controls and neurobiological correlates of clinical improvement following psychotherapy are considered.

Methods: In 1999, we retested these visual functions in 18 workers with good visual acuity. A cumulative exposure index (CEI), corrected for respirator use, was calculated for each worker. Results: Intra-individual comparison of mandelic acid (MA) showed a significant decrease over time (Friedman; P = 0.015), but current values were not related to CEI, For CV, no significant difference was observed between 1992 and 1999; present results were not related to MA or CEI. The CS profile decreased over time, with significant differences at 3 cpd (Friedman; P < 0.05). CS did not vary with MA levels, but was significantly depressed at the intermediate frequencies among those in the upper CEI category (Kruskal-Wallis; P < 0.05). Conclusions: These findings suggest that CS loss increases with long-term cumulative exposure, reflecting chronic damage to the neuro-optic pathways. (C) 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Thus, pauses, along with changes in the duration and speed of moves, form part of a dynamic system of intermittent locomotion by which animals adjust their locomotor behavior to changing circumstances. Intermittent locomotion occurs in a wide array of organisms from protozoans to mammals. It is found in aerial, aquatic and terrestrial locomotion and in many behavioral contexts including search and pursuit of prey, mate search, escape from predators, habitat assessment and general travel. In our survey, animals exhibiting intermittent locomotion paused on average nearly 50% of their locomotion time (range 6-94%). Although intermittent locomotion is usually expected to increase energetic costs as a result of additional expenditure for acceleration and deceleration, a variety of energetic benefits can arise when forward movement continues during pauses. Endurance also can be improved by partial recovery from fatigue during pauses. Perceptual benefits can arise because pauses Increase the capacity or the sensory systems to detect relevant stimuli. Several processes, including velocity blur, relative motion detection, foveation, attention and interference between sensory systems are probably involved. In animals that do not pause, alternative mechanisms for stabilizing the perceptual field are often present. Because movement is an important cue for stimulus detection, pauses can also reduce unwanted detection by an organism's predators or prey. Several models have attempted to integrate energetic and perceptual processes, but many challenges remain. Future advances will require improved quantification of the effects of speed on perception.

The neuromuscular blocking effect of 0.1 mg.kg(-1) cisatracurium at the adducting laryngeal muscles. the diaphragm and the adductor pollicis (AP) were compared. Methods: In 24 patients undergoing thyroid surgery, evoked responses from the adducting laryngeal muscles and the AP muscle were obtained using surface electromyography (EMG), Skin electrodes were placed paravertebrally near T12/L1 or L1/L2 (novel position: n = 12) or conventionally (n = 12). After stimulation of the recurrent laryngeal, phrenic and ulnar nerves, the lag, onset time and maximum effect were measured (0.1 Hz. single twitch) as well as the time to reach 25% of T1/T0 CT 25%) using train-of-four stimulation every 20 sec. Results: A mean maximum block of more than 94% was reached at all sites. Lag, onset time and T 25% at the adducting laryngeal muscles and the diaphragm were significantly (P <0.005) shorter than at the AP muscle and did not differ significantly between the two diaphragmatic monitoring sites (conventional: 64 <plus/minus> 21 sec, 166 +/- 41 sec and 20 +/- 3 min vs novel: 60 +/- 16 sec, 161 +/- 40 sec and 22 +/- 2 min respeaively), Conclusion: Onset and duration of action of 0.1 mg.kg(-1) cisatracurium was shorter at the larynx and the diaphragm than at the AP muscle. EMG results obtained from the novel. paravertebral site did not differ from the conventional monitoring site at the seventh or eighth intercostal space and suggest this alternative site is appropriate for monitoring of the diaphragm.

The unilateral cases had either partial loss (i.e. vestibular neuronitis or Meniere's disease) or total loss (i.e, vestibular nerve section), whereas bilateral cases had only partial loss (i.e. due to ototoxicity or to suspected microangiopathy, secondary to severe kidney disease). Tests were performed at 1/6-Hz passive head rotation in the dark, with peak head velocities ranging from 125 to 190 degrees /s. We report on the distinct VOR non-linearities observed in unilateral versus bilateral patients: whereas unilateral patients all exhibit an asymmetric hypofunction with decreasing VOR gain at higher head velocities, bilateral patients have a more severe but symmetric hypofunction associated with increasing VOR gain at higher head velocities. We present a model study that can duplicate the nature of these characteristics, based mainly on peripheral non-linear semicircular canal characteristics and secondary central compensation. Theoretical analyses point to the importance of clinical test parameters (rotation speed and frequency) in the determination of a functional VOR and the detection of reflex non-linearities, so that test protocols can seriously bias the evaluation of adequate functional recovery.

The first part of the normal fusion method derives quantitative values from functional input data by sampling the latter along a path determined by the (inward) normal of a surface extracted from anatomical data; the functional information is thereby projected onto the anatomical surface independently of the viewpoint. Fusion of the anatomical and functional information is then performed with a color-encoding scheme based on the HSV model. This model is preferred over the RGB model to allow easy, rapid, and intuitive retrospective manipulation of the color encoding of the functional information in the integrated display, and two possible strategies for this manipulation are explained. The results first show several clinical examples that are used to demonstrate the viability of the normal fusion method. These same examples are then used to evaluate the two HSV color manipulation strategies. Furthermore, five nuclear medicine physicians used several other clinical cases to evaluate the overall approach for manipulation of the color encoded functional contribution to an integrated 3D visualization. The integrated display using the normal fusion technique combined with the added functionality provided by the retrospective color manipulation was highly appreciated by the clinicians and can be considered an important asset in the investigation of data from multiple modalities.

Response latency is longest for this same frequency. We investigate the mechanisms that might account for the longer latency of ON1 to cricket-like sounds. Intracellular recordings revealed no evidence for appropriately timed postsynaptic inhibition of ON1 that might increase its latency, nor was latency affected bg picrotoxin, The onset of excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) was delayed for 4.5 kHz stimuli compared with ultrasound stimuli, pointing to a presynaptic locus for the latency difference. When ON1 is stimulated with high frequencies, discrete, apparently unitary EPSPs can be recorded in its dendrite, and these are latency-locked to spikes recorded simultaneously in the auditory nerve. This suggests that input to ON1 from high-frequency-tuned auditory receptor neurons is monosynaptic. In agreement with this, brief ultrasound stimuli evoke a single, short-latency EPSP in ON1, In contrast, the EPSP evoked by a brief 4.5 kHz stimulus consists of an early component, similar in latency to that evoked by ultrasound and possibly evoked by ultrasound-tuned receptors, and a later, dominant component. We interpret the early peak as arising from a monosynaptic afferent pathway and the late peak from a polysynaptic afferent pathway, Multiple-peak EPSPs, with timing similar to those evoked by sound stimuli, were also evoked by electrical stimulation of the auditory nerve.

Following a 96-h treatment, nerve growth factor (1-100 ng/mL) increased choline acetyltransferase activity (168-339% of control), acetylcholine content (141-185%), as well as constitutive (148-283%) and K+-stimulated (162-399%) acetylcholine release, but increased release was not accompanied by increased high-affinity choline uptake. Enhancement of ACh release was attenuated by vesamicol (1 muM), suggesting a vesicular source, and was abolished under choline-free conditions, emphasizing the importance of extracellular choline as the primary source for acetylcholine synthesized for release. A greater proportion of acetylcholine released from nerve growth factor-treated cultures than from nerve growth factor-naive cultures was blocked by voltage-gated Ca2+ channel antagonists, suggesting that nerve growth factor modified this parameter of neurotransmitter release. Cotreatment of NGF (20 ng/mL) with K252a (200 nM) abolished increases in ChAT activity and prevented enhancement of K+-stimulated ACh release beyond the level associated with K252a, suggesting the involvement of TrkA receptor signaling. Also, neurotrophin-3, neurotrophin-4 and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (all at 5-200:ng/mL) increased acetylcholine release, although they were not as potent as nerve growth factor and higher concentrations were required. High brain-derived neurotrophic factor concentrations (100 and 200 ng/mL) did, however, increase release to a level similar to nerve growth factor, in summary, long-term exposure (days) of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons to nerve growth factor, and in a less-potent fashion the other neurotrophins, enhanced the release of acetylcholine, which was dependent upon a vesicular pool and the availability of extracellular choline.

Regulation of its gene expression is complex and different regulatory mechanisms appear to be operative in various neuronal lineages. Pitx3, a homeodomain-containing transcription factor, has been cloned from neuronal tissues and, in the CNS, mouse Pitx3 is exclusively expressed in midbrain dopaminergic (MesDA) neurons from embryonic day 11 (Ell). TH appears in these neurons at E11.5, consistent with a putative role of Pitx3 in TH transcription. We show that Pitx3 activates the TH promoter through direct interaction with a single high-affinity binding site within the promoter and that this site is sufficient for Pitx3 responsiveness. In contrast, we did not observe an effect of Nurr1, an orphan nuclear receptor essential for normal development of MesDA neurons, on TH promoter activity. Pitx3 activation of TH promoter activity appears to be cell-dependent suggesting that Pitx3 action may be modulated by other(s) regulatory mechanism(s) and factor(s).

In return, the neocortex sends a massive feedback projection back to the thalamus. The thalamus also receives neuromodulatory inputs from the brain stem reticular formation, which is vigorously activated during arousal. We investigated the effects of two neuromodulators, acetylcholine and norepinephrine, on corticothalamic responses in vitro and in vivo. Results from rodent slices in vitro showed that acetylcholine and norepinephrine depress the efficacy of corticothalamic synapses while enhancing their frequency-dependent facilitation. This produces a stronger depression of low-frequency responses than of high-frequency responses. The effects of acetylcholine and norepinephrine were mimicked by muscarinic and alpha (2)-adrenergic receptor agonists and blocked by muscarinic and alpha -adrenergic antagonists, respectively. Stimulation of the brain stem reticular formation in vivo also strongly depressed corticothalamic responses. The suppression was very strong for low-frequency responses, which do not produce synaptic facilitation, but absent for high-frequency corticothalamic responses. As in vitro, application of muscarinic and alpha -adrenergic antagonists into the thalamus in vivo abolished the suppression of corticothalamic responses induced by stimulating the reticular formation. In conclusion, cholinergic and noradrenergic activation during arousal high-pass filters corticothalamic activity. Thus, during arousal only high-frequency inputs from the neocortex are allowed to reach the thalamus. Neuromodulators acting on corticothalamic synapses gate the flow of cortical activity to the thalamus as dictated by behavioral state.

We examined the mechanisms that contribute to dendritic Ca2+ increases in these interneurons during agonist activation of mGluRs and during synaptically evoked burst discharges, using simultaneous whole cell recordings and confocal Ca2+ imaging in rat hippocampal slices. First, we found that the group I/II mGluR agonist 1S,3R-1-aminocyclopentane-1,3- dicarboxylic acid (ACPD; 100 muM) increased dendritic [Ca2+](i) and depolarized OA interneurons. Dendritic Ca2+ responses were correlated with membrane depolarizations, but Ca2+ responses induced by ACPD were larger in amplitude than those elicited by equivalent somatic depolarization. Next, we used linescans to measure changes in dendritic [Ca2+](i) during synaptically evoked burst discharges and somatically elicited repetitive firing in disinhibited slices. Dendritic Ca2+ signals and electrophysiological responses were stable over repeated trials. Peak Ca2+ responses were linearly related to number and frequency of action potentials in burst discharges for both synaptic and somatic stimulation, but the slope of the relationship was steeper for responses evoked somatically. Synaptically evoked [Ca2+](i) rises and excitatory postsynaptic potentials were abolished by antagonists of ionotropic glutamate receptors. The group I/II mGluR antagonist S-alpha -methyl-4-carboxyphenylglycine (500 muM) produced a significant partial reduction of synaptically evoked dendritic Ca2+ responses. The mGluR antagonist did not affect synaptically evoked burst discharges and did not reduce either Ca2+ responses or burst discharges evoked somatically. Therefore ionotropic glutamate receptors appear necessary for synaptically evoked dendritic Ca2+ responses, and group I/II mGluRs may contribute partially to these responses. Dendritic [Ca2+](i) rises mediated by both ionotropic and metabotropic glutamate receptors may be important for synaptic plasticity and the selective vulnerability to excitotoxicity of OA interneurons.

The dependence of symptoms and axonal degeneration on neurofilament accumulation has been tested here in a transgenic mouse model (Eyer and Peterson, 1994) lacking axonal NFs and using two prototypic toxicant models. Chronic acrylamide (ACR) or 2,5-hexanedione exposure resulted in progressive and cumulative increases in sensorimotor deficits. Neurobehavioral tests demonstrated similar expression of neurotoxicity in transgenic (T) mice and their nontransgenic (NT) littermates (containing normal numbers of axonal NFs). Axonal lesions were frequently observed after exposure to either toxicant. Quantitation of ACR-induced lesions demonstrated the distal location of pathology and equal susceptibility of T and NT axons. We conclude that axonal NFs have no effect on neurotoxicity and the pattern of pathology in these mammalian toxic neuropathies, These results also suggest that the role of neurofilament accumulation in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases requires careful evaluation.

The 1 kb TB-RBP mRNA predominates in testis, while somatic cells preferentially express the 3.0 kb TB-RBP mRNA, Here we show that the 1 kb mRNA is translated several-fold more efficiently than the 3 kb TB-RBP in rabbit reticulocyte lysates and cells with elevated levels of the 1 kB TBRBP mRNA express high levels of TB-RBP. To determine if the cleavage stimulatory factor CstF 64 can modulate the alternative splicing of the TB-RBP pre-mRNA and therefore TB-RBP expression, CstF 64 levels and binding to alternative polyadenylation sites were examined. CstF 64 is abundant in the testis and preferentially binds to a distal site in the TB-RBP pre-mRNA that produces the 3 kb TB-RBP. Moreover, upregulation or overexpression of CstF 64 increases the poly(A) site selection for the 1 kb TB-RBP mRNA. We propose that the level of the polyadenylation factor CstF 64 modulates the level of TB-RBP synthesis in male germ cells by an alternative processing of the TB-RBP pre-mRNA.

J	Granger, E; Rubin, MA; Grossberg, S; Lavoie, P				Granger, E; Rubin, MA; Grossberg, S; Lavoie, P			A What-and-Where fusion neural network for recognition and tracking of multiple radar emitters	NEURAL NETWORKS			English	Article						radar; electronic support measures; pattern recognition; data fusion; neural network; ARTMAP; Kalman filter	ARTMAP; CATEGORIZATION; CLASSIFICATION; ARCHITECTURE; SEQUENCES; MAPS	A neural network recognition and tracking system is proposed for classification of radar pulses in autonomous Electronic Support Measure systems. Radar type information is considered with position-specific information from active emitters in a scene. Type-specific parameters of the input pulse stream are fed to a neural network classifier trained on samples of data collected in the field. Meanwhile, a clustering algorithm is used to separate pulses from different emitters according to position-specific parameters of the input pulse stream. Classifier responses corresponding to different emitters are separated into tracks, or trajectories, one per active emitter, allowing for more accurate identification of radar types based on multiple views of emitter data along each emitter trajectory. Such a What-and-Where fusion strategy is motivated by a similar subdivision of labor in the brain. The fuzzy ARTMAP neural network is used to classify streams of pulses according to radar type using their functional parameters. Simulation results obtained with a radar pulse data set indicate that fuzzy ARTMAP compares favorably to several other approaches when performance is measured in terms of accuracy and computational complexity. Incorporation into fuzzy ARTMAP of negative match tracking (from ARTMAP-IC) facilitated convergence during training with this data set. Other modifications improved classification of data that include missing input pattern components and missing training classes. Fuzzy ARTMAP was combined with a bank of Kalman filters to group pulses transmitted from different emitters based on their position-specific parameters, and with a module to accumulate evidence from fuzzy ARTMAP responses corresponding to the track defined for each emitter. Simulation results demonstrate that the system provides a high level of performance on complex, incomplete and overlapping radar data. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

We compared tone perception in 12 native Mandarin speakers, who use tonal patterns to distinguish lexical meaning, with that of 12 native speakers of a nontone language, English. Subjects were scanned under two conditions: a silent resting baseline and a tonal task involving discrimination of pitch patterns in Mandarin words. Both groups showed common regions of CBF increase, but only Mandarin speakers showed additional activation in frontal, parietal, and parietooccipital regions of the left hemisphere; this latter finding indicates that language experience may influence brain circuitry in the processing of auditory cues. In contrast, only the English group showed activity in the right inferior frontal cortex, consistent with a right-hemispheric role in pitch perception. (C) 2001 Academic Press.

We report here such deregulation of Cdk5 activity associated with the hyperphosphorylation of tau and neurofilament (NF) proteins in mice expressing a mutant superoxide dismutase (SOD1(G37R)) linked to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). A Cdk5 involvement in motor neuron degeneration is supported by our analysis of three SOD1(G37R) mouse lines exhibiting perikaryal inclusions of NF proteins. Our results suggest that perikaryal accumulations of NF proteins in motor neurons may alleviate ALS pathogenesis by acting as a phosphorylation sink for Cdk5 activity, thereby reducing the detrimental hyperphosphorylation of tau and other neuronal substrates.

NK-1 receptor localization and densities were determined by quantitative autoradiography using mono-iodinated Bolton-Hunter substance P ([I-125]BHSP). Slide-mounted brainstem sections, incubated in [I-125]BHSP and then exposed to film, have shown [I-125]BHSP binding throughout many brainstem nuclei and tracts, including the ambigual/periambigual (nAmb), dorsal motor vagal (dmnv), gigantocellular (nGC), hypoglossal (nHyp), medial parabrachial (nPBM), lateral reticular (nRL), raphe magnus (nRMg), raphe obscurus (nROb) and solitary tract (nTS) nuclei. NK-1 receptor densities decreased with age. As compared to normoxia, NK-1 receptor densities increased significantly after the six-daily hypoxia protocol in nAmb, dmnv, nHyp, nRL, nRMg, nROb, and nTS of both the young and older age groups. This increase may represent receptor upregulation as an adaptation to repeated hypoxia. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science BN: All rights reserved.

Within the brain ANP inhibits drinking induced by ANG-II and blocks dehydration-induced drinking known to be caused by release of ANG-ZI. Alpha-adrenergic agonists are known to release ANP and antagonize ANG II-induced drinking. We examined the hypothesis that a. agonists block ANG-II-induced drinking by stimulating the release of ANP from ANP-secreting neurons (ANPergic neurons) within the brain that inhibit the effector neurons stimulated by ANG-II to induce drinking. Injection of ANG-II (12.5 ng) into the anteroventral region of the third ventricle (AV3V) at the effective dose to increase water intake increased plasma ANP concentrations (P<0.01) within 5 min. As described before, previous injection of phenylephrine (an <alpha>(1)-adrenergic agonist) or clonidine (an alpha (2)-adrenergic agonist) into the AV3V region significantly reduced ANG-II-induced water intake. Their injection also induced a significant increase in plasma ANP concentration and in ANP content in the olfactory bulb (OB), AV3V, medial basal hypothalamus (MBH) and median eminence (ME). These results suggest that the inhibitory effect of both a adrenergic agonists on ANG-IT-induced water intake can be explained, at least in part, by the increase in ANP content and presumed release from these neural structures. The increased release of ANP from the axons of neurons terminating on the effector neurons of the drinking response by stimulation of ANP receptors would inhibit the stimulatory response evoked by the action of ANG-II on its receptors on these same effector neurons.

We identified Tpit, a novel T box factor only present in the two pituitary POMC-expressing lineages, the corticotrophs and melanotrophs, and apparently in no other tissue, including hypothalamic POMC neurons. In pituitary cells, Tpit activation of POMC gene transcription requires cooperation with Pitx1, the two factors binding to contiguous sites within the same regulatory element. In gain-of-function experiments, Tpit induces POMC expression in undifferentiated pituitary cells, indicating that it can initiate differentiation into POMC-expressing lineages. TPIT gene mutations were found in patients with isolated deficiency of pituitary POMC-derived ACTH, in support of an essential role of Tpit for differentiation of the pituitary POMC lineage.

Results show that the SC ipsilateral to the cortical lesion suffers a 29.9% average volume reduction and a 32.7% total loss of neurons compared to the contralateral SC. Neuronal densities and metabolic activity are similar in normal and hemispherectomized monkeys. Furthermore, the ipsi- and contralesional SC receive retinal inputs as revealed with intraocular injections of tritiated proline. These data suggest that the superior colliculus retains functional capabilities following hemispherectomy in monkey. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

In rats, the most abundant neurotrophin receptor found in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), the circadian clock, is the low affinity p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR). This receptor is expressed by retinal afferents of the SCN, but nothing is known about its role in photic regulation of circadian rhythms. We show here that neonatal treatment with the retinal neurotoxin, monosodium glutamate (MSG), which has no effect on photic entrainment of circadian rhythms, nearly completely abolished p75NTR immunoreactivity in the SCN in rats. These findings suggest that p75NTR from retinal sources do not play an essential role in the mechanism mediating photic entrainment of circadian rhythms in rats. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Here we show that the atypical protein kinase C-interacting protein, p62, which binds TRAF6, selectively interacts with TrkA but not p75. In contrast, TRAF6 interacts with p75 but not TrkA. We demonstrate the formation of a TRAF6-p62 complex that serves as a bridge linking both p75 and TrkA signaling. Of functional relevance, transfection of antisense p62-enhanced p75-mediated cell death and diminished NGF-induced differentiation occur through a mechanism involving inhibition of IKK activity. These findings reveal a new function for p62 as a common platform for communication of both p75-TRAF6 and TrkA signals. Moreover, we demonstrated that p62 serves as a scaffold for activation of the NF-kappaB pathway, which mediates NGF survival and differentiation responses.

In response to agonists (atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and brain natriuretic peptide), the kinase homology domain-mediated guanylate cyclase repression is removed, which allows the production of cyclic GMP, Previous work from our laboratory strongly indicated that agonists are exerting their effects through the induction of a juxtamembrane dimeric contact. However, a direct demonstration of this mechanism remains to be provided. As a tool, we are now using the properties of a new mutation, D435C, It introduces a cysteine at a position in NPR-A corresponding to a supplementary cysteine found in NPR-C6, another receptor of this family (a disulfide-linked dimer), Although this D435C mutation only leads to trace levels of NPR-A disulfide-linked dimer at basal state, covalent dimerization can be induced by a treatment with rat ANP or with other agonists, The NPR-A(D435C) mutant has not been subjected to significant structural alterations, since it shares with the wild type receptor a similar dose response pattern of cellular guanylyl cyclase activation. However, a persistent activation accompanies NPR-A(D435C) dimer formation after the removal of the inducer agonist, On the other hand, a construction where the intracellular domain of NPR-A(D435C) has been truncated (Delta KCD435C) displays a spontaneous and complete covalent dimerization, In addition, the elimination of the intracellular domain in wild type Delta KC and Delta KCD435C is associated with an increase of agonist binding affinity, this effect being more pronounced with the weak agonist pBNP, Also, a D435C secreted extracellular domain remains unlinked even after incubation with rat ANP, In summary, these results demonstrate, in a dynamic fashion, the agonistic induction of a dimeric contact in the juxtamembrane domain of NPR-A, In addition, this process seems to require membrane attachment of the receptor. Finally, the intracellular domain represses this contact at the basal state, showing its potent influence on the outer juxtamembrane domain.

In line with this belief, we found that Italian dyslexics, using a shallow orthography which facilitates reading, performed better on reading tasks than did English and French dyslexics, However, all dyslexics were equally impaired relative to their controls on reading and phonological tasks. Positron emission tomography scans during explicit and implicit reading showed the same reduced activity in a region of the Left hemisphere in dyslexics from all three countries, with the maximum peak in the middle temporal gyrus and additional peaks in the inferior and superior temporal gyri and middle occipital gyrus. We conclude that there is a universal neurocognitive basis for dyslexia and that differences in reading performance among dyslexics of different countries are due to different orthographies.

An extraction method compatible with direct infusion inlet was developed and leads to an analysis cycle time of 7-8 min instead of 25 min that would be required for HPLC inlet. SUX was extracted from human plasma on C1 solid-phase cartridges and was analyzed using positive ion electrospray tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS). SUX plasma concentrations were determined by a stable isotope dilution assay using hexadeuterosuccinylcholine diiodide (SUXd6) as the internal standard. The calibration curve was prepared using the ratio of intensities of the major product ions in the collision-induced dissociation spectrum for known concentration ratios of SUX and SUXd6 in plasma. Calibration curves for the quantification were linear from 25 to 4000 ng/ml. For intraday precision, CV were less than or equal to6% and accuracy ranged from 98 to 103%. For the interday precision, CV were less than or equal to 10% and accuracy ranged from 90 to 102%. This method is specific, sensitive, reproducible, and practical in a clinical setting.

Heterozygous animals are characterized by a looped-tail appearance (pig tail) and wobbly head movements while homozygous embryos exhibit a neural tube closure defect that extends from the caudal midbrain to the tip of the tail. The Lp gene has been finely mapped to the distal part of chromosome 1, and a positional cloning strategy has been initiated to isolate the defective gene. This study represents the characterization of a new Lp allele (Lp(m1Jus)) induced by N-ethyl-N-nitrosurea mutagenesis. Lp(m1Jus)/+ mice have a looped-tail appearance, and both Lp(m1Jus)/Lp(m1Jus) homozygotes and Lp/Lp(m1Jus) compound heterozygotes fail to initiate neural tube closure along most of the embryonic axis. These data indicate that the Lp(m1Jus) allele causes a neural tube defect and overall phenotype similar to that of the original Lp allele. Segregation analysis of 90 (Lp(m1Jus)/+ x C57BL/6J)F-1 x C57BL/6J looped-tail mice with seven markers that define the Lp genetic map (D1Mit455/ D1Mit146/D1Mit148/D1Mif270-1 cM-D1Mit113-0.4 cM-Lp-0.2 cM-D1Mit149-0.8 cM-D1Mit115) showed significant linkage between Lp(m1Jus) and all loci analyzed (P < 0.0001), Eight crossovers were detected with the proximal cluster of D1Mit455, D1Mit146, D1Mit148, and D1Mit270, indicating a recombination rate higher than expected in this region, and a single recombinant was encountered with the distal markers D1Mit149 and D1Mit115. Based on these phenotypic and genetic data, Lp(m1Jus) is most likely allelic to Lp, thereby representing a valuable additional tool for the positional cloning of the LI, gene and its subsequent molecular characterization.

Thapsigargin (tg), an inhibitor of Ca2+-ATPase pumps of internal stores, caused a transient Ca2+ elevation in PSCs, whereas it had no effect on Ca2+ stores of presynaptic terminals at rest. Tg prolonged presynaptic Ca2+ responses evoked by single action potentials with no detectable increase in the resting Ca2+ level in nerve terminals. However, Ca2+ accumulation was observed during high frequency stimulation. Tg induced a rapid rise in endplate potential (EPP) amplitude, accompanied by a delayed and transient increase. The effects appeared presynaptic, as suggested by the lack of effects of tg on the amplitude and time course of miniature EPPs (MEPPs). However, MEPP frequency was increased when preparations were stimulated tonically (0.2 Hz). The delayed and transient increase in EPP amplitude was occluded by injections of the Ca2+ chelator BAPTA into PSCs before tg application, whereas a rise in intracellular Ca2+ in PSCs induced by inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) injections potentiated transmitter release. Furthermore, increased Ca2+ buffering capacity after BAPTA injection in PSCs resulted in a more pronounced synaptic depression induced by high frequency stimulation of the motor nerve (10 Hz/80 sec). It is concluded that presynaptic Ca2+ stores act as a Ca2+ clearance mechanism to limit the duration of transmitter release, whereas Ca2+ release from glial stores initiates Ca2+-dependent potentiation of synaptic transmission.

We found a severe myelin deficit in forebrain at all ages from 14 d to 1 year. The deficit was maximal at 1 month of age and was similar regardless of mouse strain background or whether it was determined by bulk isolation of myelin or by quantitation of myelin basic protein. To determine the cellular basis of the myelin deficit, we counted oligodendrocytes in tissue sections of mice expressing oligodendrocyte-targeted beta -galactosidase, and we used light and electron microscopy to examine the number and morphology of myelinated fibers and size of myelinated CNS structures. All of these parameters were reduced in fyn(-/-) mice. Unexpectedly, there were regional differences in the myelin deficit; in contrast to forebrain, fyn(-/-) cervical spinal cord exhibited no reduction in myelin content, number of oligodendrocytes, or number of myelinated fibers, nor was myelination delayed developmentally. We found that oligodendrocytes express Src, but there was no significant reduction of myelin content in null mutants lacking the Fyn-related kinases Src, Yes, or Lyn. Finally, we investigated the molecular features of Fyn that are required for myelination and found that a single amino acid substitution, which abolishes the tyrosine kinase activity of Fyn, resulted in a myelin deficit as great as that observed in the complete absence of Fyn protein. These results demonstrate that Fyn plays a unique role in myelination, one that requires its kinase activity.

Angular head-in-space velocity is detected by vestibular hair cells that are located within the semicircular canals of the inner ear. In turn, the afferent fibers of the vestibular nerve project to neurons in the vestibular nuclei, which, in head-restrained animals, similarly encode head-in-space velocity during passive whole-body rotation. However, during the active head-on-body movements made to generate orienting gaze shifts, neurons in the vestibular nuclei do not reliably encode head-in-space motion. The mechanism that underlies this differential processing of vestibular information is not known. To address this issue, we studied vestibular nuclei neural responses during passive head rotations and during a variety of tasks in which alert rhesus monkeys voluntarily moved their heads relative to space. Neurons similarly encoded head-in-space velocity during passive rotations of the head relative to the body and during passive rotations of the head and body together in space. During all movements that were generated by activation of the neck musculature (voluntary head-on-body movements), neurons were poorly modulated. In contrast, during a task in which each monkey actively "drove" its head and body together in space by rotating a steering wheel with its arm, neurons reliably encoded head-in-space motion. Our results suggest that, during active head-on-body motion, an efferent copy of the neck motor command, rather than the monkey's knowledge of its self-generated head-in-space motion or neck proprioceptive information, gates the differential processing of vestibular information at the level of the vestibular nuclei.

Monoclonal antibodies A2B5, A007, anti-vimentin, and anti-galactocerebroside, recognize oligodendroglia at different stages of development. The neuroepithelial precursor marker nestin is also expressed by the oligodendroglial lineage; we have used enriched populations of progenitors isolated from neonatal rat brain cultures to further examine the cellular distribution of this intermediate filament protein. The phenotypic distribution of nestin positive cells among the oligodendrocyte Lineage showed that 65% reacted with A2B5, whereas only 5% were A007(+), and 4% galactocerebroside(+)'. The remaining 25% of the cells were not labeled and had small cellular bodies devoid of processes, characteristic of the pre-O2A progenitor. Further analysis of the nestin(+) population showed that the majority of the cells were also vimentin(+). Antibody-dependent complement mediated cytolysis of A2B5(+) (O2A cells) and galactocerebroside(+) (mature oligodendrocytes) cells left a population of nestin(+) cells that were induced to proliferate in the presence of growth factors and to differentiate into A2B5(+) and galactocerebroside(+) cells. Proliferating cells maintained in the presence of platelet-derived growth factor or basic fibroblast growth factor retained nestin expression along with A2B5. By contrast, in serum-free medium nestin expression decreased while postmitotic cells acquired A007 and galactocerebroside. Our results suggest that nestin expression is a marker of pre-O2A cells that is maintained in proliferating glial progenitors, but is quickly down-regulated in postmitotic oligodendrocytes (A007(+)/galacto-cerebroside(+)) along with A2B5 and vimentin. However, other glial cells including type 2 astrocytes and some amoeboid microglia also share nestin expression. (C) 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Previous in vivo electrophysiological studies from our laboratory have demonstrated that several selective a, ligands potentiate the neuronal response to NMDA. The goal of the present series of experiments was to assess the effects of some selective a, ligands on the potentiation of the NMDA response and to determine if this potentiation was mediated by the naloxone-sensitive a receptor. Extracellular unitary recordings from pyramidal neurons of the CA, region of the rat dorsal hippocampus were obtained. The a, ligands ED 737, L 687-384, and JO-1784 (igmesine), administered intravenously at low doses, potentiated the NMDA response but the opiate antagonist naloxone failed to reverse this potentiation. However, the potentiation of the NMDA response induced by the a, ligand (+)pentazocine was suppressed by naloxone but not by the mu antagonist cyprodime hydrobomide, the kappa antagonist DIPPA nor by the delta antagonist naltrindole. (+/-) Cyclazocine, which presents a high affinity for the above-mentioned sigma -opiate receptor acted as an antagonist by suppressing the potentiation of the NMDA response induced by both JO-1784 and (+)pentazocine. These results suggest that the effects induced by some a, ligands may, in fact, be sensitive to naloxone while others may not. The original classification of a receptors as opiates might have been partly accurate. Synapse 39:323-331, 2001. (C) 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Activation of PKC by phorbol esters resulted in a rapid, robust advance of distal microtubules (MTs) into the F-actin rich peripheral domain of growth cones, where they are normally excluded. In contrast, inhibition of PKC activity by bisindolylmaleimide and related compounds had no perceptible effect on growth cone motility, but completely blocked phorbol ester effects. Significantly, MT advance occurred despite continued retrograde F-actin flow-a process that normally inhibits MT advance. Polymer assembly was necessary for PKC-mediated MT advance since it was highly sensitive to a range of antagonists at concentrations that specifically interfere with microtubule dynamics. Biochemical evidence is presented that PKC activation promotes formation of a highly dynamic MT pool. Direct assessment of microtubule dynamics and translocation using the fluorescent speckle microscopy microtubule marking technique indicates PKC activation results in a nearly twofold increase in the typical lifetime of a MT growth episode, accompanied by a 1.7-fold increase and twofold decrease in rescue and catastrophe frequencies. respectively. No significant effects on instantaneous microtubule growth, shortening, or sliding rates tin either anterograde or retrograde directions) were observed. MTs also spent a greater percentage of time undergoing retrograde transport after PKC activation, despite overall MT advance. These re suits suggest that regulation of MT assembly by PKC may be an important factor in determining neurite outgrowth and regrowth rates and may play a role in other cellular processes dependent on directed MT advance.

Levels of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and PECAM-1 were measured by Western blots and both were enriched in the positively selected EC fractions. The multidrug resistance P-glycoprotein (P-gp) was strongly enriched (59-fold) in the EC fraction from brain and was absent in the negative fraction, in which the glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), an astrocyte marker, was present. Lower P-gp levels were detected in EC from renal cortex and lung. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis showed that the mdr1a gene was preferentially expressed in EC fraction from the brain. The mdr1b gene was found in EC from renal cortex whereas both mdr1 genes were detected in EC from lung. Our results indicate that EC can be isolated using microbeads and that the isoform of P-gp found in brain is mostly mdr1a, associated with EC. (C) 2001 Academic Press.

In these disorders, a primary nuclear gene defect causes secondary mtDNA loss or deletion formation, which leads to tissue dysfunction. Therefore, the diseases clinically resemble those caused by mtDNA mutations, but follow a Mendelian inheritance pattern. Several clinical entities associated with multiple mtDNA deletions have been characterized, the most frequently described being autosomal dominant progressive external ophthalmoplegia (adPEO). MtDNA depletion syndrome (MDS) is a severe disease of childhood, in which tissue-specific loss of mtDNA is seen. Mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalomyopathy (MNGIE) patients may have multiple mtDNA deletions and/or mtDNA depletion. Recent reports of thymidine phosphorylase mutations in MNGIE and adenine nucleotide translocator mutations in adPEO have given new insights into the mechanisms of mtDNA maintenance in mammals. The common mechanism underlying both of these gene defects could be disturbed mitochondrial nucleoside pools, the building blocks of mtDNA. Future studies on MNGIE and adPEO pathogenesis, and identification of additional gene defects in adPEO and MDS will provide further understanding about the mammalian mtDNA maintenance and the crosstalk between the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes.

Our purpose was to determine whether the same changes in aortic isthmus flow in human subjects have any impact on neurodevelopmental outcome. STUDY DESIGN: Forty-four fetuses were retrospectively included in this study on the basis of an abnormal Doppler velocity in the umbilical artery. Mean gestational age at delivery was 33.0 +/-: 2.0 weeks and mean birth weight 1386 +/- 435 g. The neurodevelopmental condition was assessed between the ages of 2 and 4 years. The developmental score was analyzed in relation to the flow patterns in the fetal aortic isthmus, which were classified as follows. group A, net isthmic flow antegrade (defined as the ratio of the systolic antegrade to the diastolic retrograde velocity integrals) (n = 39); group B, net isthmic flow retrograde (n = 5). RESULTS: Nonoptimal neurodevelopment was observed in 19 (49%) of 39 fetuses in group A and in all 5 fetuses (100%) in group B. This difference is significant and leads to a relative risk of 2.05 (95% confidence interval, 1.49-2.83) for neurodevelopmental deficit when predominantly retrograde flow is observed in the fetal aortic isthmus before birth. CONCLUSION: Measuring the ratio of antegrade to retrograde velocity integrals in the aortic isthmus could help in the indirect assessment of cerebral oxygenation during placental circulatory insufficiency.

Wild-type (WT) mice or mice deficient in the nNOS gene (nNOS(-/-)) were injected with either saline (control) or Escherichia coli LPS (LPS groups) and sacrificed 12 h later. The diaphragm was then examined for NOS expression, NOS activity, and in-vitro contractility. We also assessed sarcolemmal injury in isolated muscle strips under resting condition and after 3 min of artificial stimulations. In WT mice, LPS injection reduced maximum force to about 75% of that of control animals and raised total NOS activity significantly due to the induction of the iNOS isoform. Although muscle fiber injury was minimal under resting condition, the percentage of injured fibers in control and LPS-injected mice approached 27% and 40% of total fibers, respectively, in response to artificial stimulation. By comparison, LPS injection in nNOS-/- mice elicited a worsening of muscle contractility (maximum force < 60% of control animals) but elicited degrees of sarcolemmal injury similar to those observed in the WT animals. In addition, muscle NOS activity and iNOS protein level in nNOS(-/-) mice injected with LPS reached about 10% and 60% of that of WT animals, respectively (p < 0.05 compared with WT animals). Protein level of endothelial NOS isoform in the diaphragm was not altered by LPS injection in either WT or nNOS(-/-) animals. We conclude that nNOS plays a protective role in attenuating the negative influence of sepsis on diaphragmatic contractility but is not involved in the pathogenesis of sepsis-induced sarcolemmal injury.

We tested these findings in a sample of girls with ADHD. Methods: Anatomic brain magnetic resonance images from 50 girls with ADHD, of severity comparable with that in previously studied boys. and 50 healthy female control subjects, aged 5 to 15 years, were obtained with a 1.5-T scanner with contiguous 2-mm coronal slices and 1.5-mm axial slices. We measured volumes of total cerebrum, frontal lobes, caudate nucleus, globus pallidus, cerebellum, and cerebellar vermis. Behavioral measures included structured psychiatric interviews, parent and teacher ratings, and the Wechsler vocabulary and block design subtests. Results: Total brain volume was smaller in girls with ADHD than in control subjects (effect size, 0.40; P=.05). As in our previous study in boys with ADHD, girls with ADHD had significantly smaller volumes in the posterior-inferior cerebellar vermis (lobules VIII-X; effect size, 0.54; P=.04), even when adjusted for total cerebral Volume and vocabulary score. Patients and controls did not differ in asymmetry in any region. Morphometric differences correlated significantly with several ratings of ADHD severity and were not predicted by past or present stimulant drug exposure. Conclusions: These results confirm previous findings for boys in the posterior-inferior lobules of the cerebellar vermis. The influence of the cerebellar vermis on pre frontal and striatal circuitry should be explored.

Design: Convenience sample. Setting: University secondary care rehabilitation center. Patients: Twelve patients with hemiparesis and 12 subjects without neurologic disorder. Interventions: Subjects were seated on a forceplate, with forearms fixed in cuffs mounted on a force transducer, Two trials per side of isometric abduction of arm were conducted. The orthogonal force and torque exerted was measured for each arm. Main Outcome Measures: Forces at the upper limbs and at the seat, global motor performance, spasticity of upper limb, grip force, and dexterity. Results: Results of analyses of variance showed differences in the magnitude of the contralateral limb forces generated by subjects with hemiparesis and healthy subjects (p < .05). Normalized contralateral forces in the nonparetic upper limb associated with paretic isometric efforts were higher than those associated with nonparetic efforts and higher than those associated with efforts in healthy subjects. Conclusion: These results suggest that postural stabilization during isometric efforts is impaired in subjects with hemiparesis.

AD is neuropathologically characterized by amyloid and neurofibrillary tangle depositions, basal forebrain cholinergic deficit, and extensive neuronal loss and synaptic changes in the cortex and hippocampus. Mutations of amyloid precursor protein or presenilin genes or apolipoprotein E gene polymorphism appear to affect amyloid formation, which in rum causes neuronal death via a number of possible mechanisms, including Ca2+ homeostasis disruption, oxidative stress, excitotoxicity, energy depletion, neuro-inflammation and apoptosis. Nitric oxide (NO) is an enzymatic product of nitric oxide synthase, which exists in three isoforms. In addition to its vasoactive and immunological properties, NO has significant neurophysiological functions. However, NO call also be neurotoxic primarily due to its free radical properties, and it has been implicated in neurodegenerative diseases. Interestingly, there is increasing evidence that NO may have a role in the aforementioned AD pathogenetic mechanisms, and putative links between NO and AD are beginning to be recognized.

Methods: In a first session, only scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded from 15 patients. We averaged the first detectable ictal activity in two consecutive segments of stable topography and morphology. Spatio-temporal dipole sources were estimated for each segment and projected on 3D-magnetic resonance images. In a second session, SEEG was recorded simultaneously with control scalp electrodes, allowing the identification of ictal patterns similar to those submitted to dipole modeling. Results: Ictal discharges could be analyzed in only 6 of 15 patients. In the remaining 9, scalp discharges were undetectable or nonreproducible in 6, and solutions were unstable despite an apparently stable discharge in 3. In the 6 patients successfully modeled, dipoles were found in regions where SEEG discharges were present. However, when intracerebral discharges were very focal, there was no corresponding scalp activity. When intracerebral signals were maximal in the mesial temporal regions at the seizure onset, only lateral neocortical dipoles were found. When discharges reached the frontal lobes, we could identify lateral and mesial frontal sources. Conclusions: In most seizures, it was not possible to obtain satisfactory dipole models, probably a reflection of the high noise level or widespread generators. When modeling was possible, our results suggested that mesial temporal seizure discharges did not contribute to scalp EEG activity. This activity appears to reflect signals synchronized and distributed over the lateral temporal or frontal neocortex, as well as signals generated in mesial frontal areas.

The aim of the present study was to look at the effects of age on the number, density, duration, intra-spindle frequency, and periodicity of SS during stage 2 sleep in normal subjects of different age groups. Methods: Thirty-six healthy subjects participated in the study. They were divided into 6 age groups: 10-19, 20-29, 30-39, 40-49, 50-59 and 60-69 years. Results: The results show that there is a progessive decrease in SS number, density, duration and a progressive increase in intra-spindle frequency with age. These changes occur mainly in the first 4 decades, except for SS number and density, for which the changes seem to continue until the sixth decade. The present study also reveals a clear periodicity of SS in human sleep. SS occur every 3-6 s, and the modal value of inter-spindle intervals increases with aging. Conclusions: The progressive decrease in the number of SS and slow-wave sleep time with age suggests that SS are part of sleep promoting mechanisms. The negative correlation found between SS density and sleep efficiency in the present study is congruent with the sleep maintenance role of SS. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

In both tests, ERPs displayed the usual positive shift known as the ERP repetition effect. In the indirect test, this effect includes parietal effect (the usual N400 effect) and a right fronto-central effect, Both effects are also present in the direct test. Two additional effects are present only in the direct test. These effects are an early fronto-polar effect and a late posterior effect (the usual P600 effect). These findings are taken as support for the distinction between 'associative' processes elicited in both the direct and indirect tests, and 'episodic' processes elicited only in the direct test. This task dissociation could well provide a scalp correlate of the distinction between the neocortical and cortico-limbic systems that have been shown to contribute respectively to associative and episodic processing. In addition, it is proposed that the dissociation between the two frontal effects could be accounted for by a distinction between the processing of intrinsic vs. extrinsic contextual attributes as a function of the task requirements.

J	Shultz, TR; Rivest, F				Shultz, TR; Rivest, F			Knowledge-based cascade-correlation: using knowledge to speed learning	CONNECTION SCIENCE			English	Article						knowledge; learning; cascade-correlation; generative networks		Research with neural networks typically ignores the role of knowledge in learning by initializing the network with random connection weights. We examine a new extension of a well-known generative algorithm, cascade-correlation. Ordinary cascade-correlation constructs its own network topology by recruiting new hidden units as needed to reduce network error. The extended algorithm, knowledge-based cascade-correlation (KBCC), recruits previously learned sub-networks as well as single hidden units. This paper describes KBCC and assesses its performance on a series of small, but clear problems involving discrimination between two classes. The target class is distributed as a simple geometric figure. Relevant source knowledge consists of various linear transformations of the target distribution. KBCC is observed to find, adapt and use its relevant knowledge to speed learning significantly.

Using RACE, RT-PCR, and primer extension on human fetal brain and heart mRNAs, we here demonstrate the existence of six mRNA variants resulting from alternative promoter usage and splicing. These transcripts encode four protein isoforms differing at their N terminus by the composition of their KRAB motif. One isoform, ZNF74-I, which corresponds to the originally cloned cDNA, was found to be encoded by two additional mRNA variants. This isoform, which contains a KRAB motif lacking the N terminus of the KRAB A box, was devoid of transcriptional activity. In contrast, ZNF74-II, a newly identified form of the protein that is encoded by a single transcript and contains an intact KRAB domain with full A and B boxes, showed strong repressor activity. Deconvolution immunofluorescence microscopy using transfected human neuroblastoma cells and nonimmortalized HS68 fibroblasts revealed a distinct subcellular distribution for ZNF74-I and ZNF74-II, In contrast to ZNF74-I, which largely colocalizes with SC-35 in nuclear speckles enriched in splicing factors, the transcriptionally active ZNF74-II had a more diffuse nuclear distribution that is more characteristic of transcriptional regulators. Taken with the previously described RNA-binding activity of ZNP74-I and direct interaction with a hyperphosphorylated form of the RNA polymerase IT participating in pre-mRNA processing, our results suggest that the two ZNF74 isoforms exert different or complementary roles in RNA maturation and in transcriptional regulation.

EPILEPSIA			English	Article						cryptogenic epilepsy; Toxoplasma gondii; parasitic infections; bradyzoite; seizures	HOST-PARASITE RELATIONSHIP; TOXOPLASMA-GONDII; EPIDEMIOLOGY; ENCEPHALITIS; POPULATION; ROCHESTER; MINNESOTA	Purpose: Cryptogenic epilepsy, the group of epilepsy syndromes for which an etiology is unknown, comprises similar to 20% of all epilepsy syndromes. We selected patients in this subgroup of epilepsy and tested them for evidence of Toxoplasma gondii IgG antibodies by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. T. gondii is found in up to 20% of the U.S. population forming dormant brain cysts in the latent bradyzoite form. We investigated the hypothesis that dormant T. gondii infection might be associated with cryptogenic epilepsy. Methods: We selected patients with cryptogenic epilepsies and tested them for evidence of T. gondii IgG antibodies by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. A control group was also tested for comparison. Results: We have found a statistically-significant elevation of T. gondii antibodies among cryptogenic epilepsy patients as compared to controls [59% increase in optical density (OD), p = 0.013]. This association persisted after adjustment for subjects' gender and age in a multiple logistic regression model; however, it was no longer as statistically significant. Conclusions: Our results suggest that chronic T. gondii infection with brain cysts may be a cause of cryptogenic epilepsy.

A short period of pairing (20 trials) increased the area of the two main components of the evoked potential by 37.1+/-13.5% (+/-SEM) and 37.9+/-6.8%, respectively. The effects lasted for the duration of the experiment (>2 h). The enhancement could be blocked by either MK-801, an NMDA receptor antagonist or by L-NAME, a nitric-oxide-synthase inhibitor when they were given prior to pairing. Control experiments with Skin stimulation alone and basal forebrain stimulation alone had only small long-term effects (similar to 10%) on the size of the evoked potential. Thus, long term cholinergic enhancement, attributable to disinhibition and increased release of acetylcholine in the cortex during neuronal excitation by other sources, and so named because it is blocked by atropine, may be a form of long-term potentiation. The existence of such a mechanism for the control of cortical neuronal plasticity identifies the basal forebrain as a powerful modulator of long-lasting changes in cortical neuronal excitability.

We examined the expression of the netrin receptors DCC and UNC5H2 in adult rat retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) after grafting a peripheral nerve (PN) to the transected optic nerve and following optic nerve transection alone. In situ hybridization revealed that both Dec and Unc5h2 mRNAs are expressed by normal adult RGCs. In addition, netrin-1 was found to be constitutively expressed by RGCs. Quantitative analysis using in situ hybridization demonstrated that both Dec and Unc5h2 were down-regulated by RGCs following axotomy. In the presence of an attached PN graft, Dec and Unc5h2 were similarly down-regulated in surviving RGCs regardless of their success in regenerating an axon. Northern blot analysis demonstrated expression of netrin-1 in both optic and sciatic nerve, and Western blot analysis revealed the presence of netrin protein in both nerves. Immunohistochemical analysis indicated that netrin protein was closely associated with glial cells in the optic nerve. These results suggest that netrin-1, DCC, and UNC5H2 may contribute to regulating the regenerative capacity of adult RGCs. a zool Academic Press.

We have used a number of approaches to probe the evolutionary history of these genes and show that SMN gene duplication and the appearance of SMN2 occurred at very distinct evolutionary times. Molecular fossil and molecular clock data suggest that this duplication may have occurred as recently as 3 million years ago in that the position and identity repetitive elements are identical for both human SMN genes and overall sequence divergence ranged from 0.15% to 0.34%. However, these approaches ignore the possibility of sequence homogenization by means of gene conversion. Consequently, we have used quantitative polymerase chain rection and analysis of allelic variants to provide physical evidence for or against SMN gene duplication in the chimpanzee, mankind's closest relative. These studies have revealed that chimpanzees have 2-7 copies of the SMN gene per diploid genome; however, the two nucleotides diagnostic for exons 7-8 and the SMN Delta7 mRNA product of the SMN2 gene are absent in non-human primates. In contrast, the SMN2 gene has been detected in all extant human populations studied to date, including representatives from Europe, the Central African Republic, and the Congo. These data provide conclusive evidence that SMN gene duplication occurred more than 5 million years ago, before the separation of human and chimpanzee lineages, bur that SMN2 appears for the first time in Homo sapiens.

The most common genetic cause of hyperhomocysteinemia is the 677C-->T mutation in the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene. This variant, with mild enzymatic deficiency, is associated with an increased risk for neural tube defects and pregnancy complications and with a decreased risk for colon cancer and leukemia. Although many studies have reported that this variant is also a risk factor for vascular disease, this area of investigation is still controversial. Severe MTHFR deficiency results in homocystinuria, an inborn error of metabolism with neurological and vascular complications. To investigate the in vivo pathogenetic mechanisms of MTHFR deficiency, we generated mice with a knockout of Mthfr. Plasma total homocysteine levels in heterozygous and homozygous knockout mice are 1.,6- and 10-fold higher than those in wild-type littermates, respectively. Both heterozygous and homozygous knockouts have either significantly decreased S-adenosylmethionine levels or significantly increased S-adenosylhomocysteine levels, or both, with global DNA hypomethylation. The heterozygous knockout mice appear normal, whereas the homozygotes are smaller and show developmental retardation with cerebellar pathology. Abnormal lipid deposition in the proximal portion of the aorta was observed in older heterozygotes and homozygotes, alluding to an atherogenic effect of hyperhomocysteinemia in these mice.

Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and functional imaging techniques are increasingly recognized as useful tools for the characterization of strokes. The aim of this study was to compare cortical and subcortical (lacunar) strokes by MRS and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) experiments as a function of time. METHODS, Single-voxel MRS, DWI, and perfusion-weighted imaging data were recorded on patients with cortical (n = 7) or subcortical (n = 7) strokes in the acute, subacute, and chronic periods. Magnetic resonance spectra were acquired in three regions: hyperintense DWI area, adjacent area with normal DWI intensity, and contralateral area, Neurological deficits were estimated by the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, RESULTS, Decreases in N-acetylaspartate, choline-containing compounds, and creatine/phosphocreatine signal intensity as well as the presence of lactate were observed at all times in the hyperintense DWI area of all lesions, Small decreases were measured in the subacute and chronic phases for the adjacent area of cortical strokes but not for the adjacent area of subcortical strokes. The existence of a surrounding affected area in subcortical strokes is deduced from a combination of MRS and DWI results, possibly corresponding to the ischemic penumbra, Differences were found between the two types of lesion, especially an increased time variability of apparent diffusion coefficients in subcortical strokes. CONCLUSIONS, Magnetic resonance spectroscopy provides evidence for the existence of affected tissue outside the hyperintense DWI regions in subcortical strokes, Cortical and subcortical strokes display different DWI and MRS characteristics.

The extent to which these changes affect neuromuscular transmission efficacy is uncertain. In this study, the effects of habitual exercise on the electrophysiological properties of neuromuscular transmission in rat soleus muscle were investigated using a novel in situ approach. Consistent with previous reports, miniature endplate potential frequency was enhanced by habitual exercise. Other passive properties, such as resting membrane potential, miniature endplate potential amplitude, and "giant" miniature endplate potential characteristics were unaltered by the training program. Full-size endplate potentials were obtained by blocking soleus muscle action potentials with mu -conotoxin GIIIb. Quantal content values were 91.5 and 119.9 for control and active groups, respectively (P < 0.01). We also measured the rate and extent of endplate potential amplitude rundown during 3-s trains of continuous stimulation at 25, 50, and 75 Hz; at 50 and 75 Hz, we found both the rate and extent of rundown to be significantly attenuated (10-20%) in a specific population of cells from active rats (P < 0.05). The results establish the degree of activity-dependent plasticity as it pertains to neuromuscular transmission in a mammalian slow-twitch muscle.

Further sequence of the cDNA was determined from 5' RACE and screening of a human brain cDNA library. The gene was named hNP22 (human neuronal protein 22). The deduced protein sequence of hNP22 has an estimated molecular mass of 22.4 kDa with a putative calcium-binding site, and phosphorylation sites for casein kinase II and protein kinase C. The deduced amino acid sequence of hNP22 shares homology (from 67% to 42%) with four other proteins, SM22 alpha, calponin, myophilin and mp20. Sequence homology suggests a potential interaction of hNP22 with cytoskeletal elements. hNP22 mRNA was expressed in various brain regions but in alcoholics, greater mRNA expression occurred in the superior frontal cortex, but not in the primary motor cortex or cerebellum. The results suggest that hNP22 may have a role in alcohol-related adaptations and may mediate regulatory signal transduction pathways in neurones.

Depolarization-induced, as well as spontaneously active, neurons exhibited calcium-dependent exocytotic events at both the soma and the terminal bulb of neuritic processes. All spontaneously active neurons exhibited a bursting activity pattern in which amplitudes of exocytotic events appeared to be distributed in a quantal-like fashion. Fast Fourier transform analysis of bursting activity in 20 such neurons revealed burst harmonics with a major frequency of 8 Hz and a dominant rate of 95 Hz for individual exocytotic events within bursts. The results suggest that exocytotic transmitter release is as ancient as neurons and that endogenously bursting neurons in the sea pansy are as complex as those of higher animals. In addition, the observation that both soma and neuritic terminals of the same neuron can release transmitter suggests that local release sites in these cnidarian neurons are not critical for nerve net function.

The mechanisms involved in this action are unknown, but neurotrophic factors such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) may play a role. In this study we investigated the changes in BDNF levels in rats in which SE had been induced by pilocarpine injection (400 mg/kg i.p.) and continued for several hours (unprotected group). In other animals (protected groups), SE was suppressed after 30 min by intraperitoneal injection of either diazepam (10 mg/kg) + pentobarbital (30 mg/kg) or paraldehyde (0.3 mg/kg). In diazepam + pentobarbital-treated rats the hippocampal damage caused by SE was significantly lower (p < 0.05) than in unprotected animals. In addition, 2 and 24 h after pilocarpine injection, the levels of BDNF mRNA were moderately increased in the unprotected group, but 'super-induced' in protected animals, especially in the neocortex and hippocampus. A time-dependent increase in BDNF immunoreactivity was also found by western blot analysis in rats treated with diazepam + pentobarbital. In contrast, a decrease of BDNF immunoreactivity occurred in the unprotected group. In conclusion, these results show that neuroprotection induced by anti-epileptic drugs in pilocarpine-treated rats is accompanied by strong potentiation of BDNF synthesis in brain regions involved in SE.

The subunit beta1 alters the kinetics and voltage-dependence of sodium channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes or mammalian cells. Functional modulation in oocytes depends on specific regions in the N-terminal extracellular domain of beta1, but does not require the intracellular C-terminal domain. Functional modulation is qualitatively different in mammalian cells, and thus could involve different molecular mechanisms. As a first step toward testing this hypothesis, we examined modulation of brain Na(V)1.2a sodium channel alpha subunits expressed in Chinese hamster lung cells by a mutant beta1 construct with 34 amino acids deleted from the C-terminus. This deletion mutation did not modulate sodium channel function in this cell system. Co-immunoprecipitation data suggest that this loss of functional modulation was caused by inefficient association of the mutant beta1 with alpha, despite high levels of expression of the mutant protein. In Xenopus oocytes, injection of approximately 10 000 times more mutant beta1 RNA was required to achieve the level of functional modulation observed with injection of full-length beta1. Together, these findings suggest that the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of beta1 is an important determinant of beta1 binding to the sodium channel alpha subunit in both mammalian cells and Xenopus oocytes.

Using positron emission tomography (PET) and the H-2 O-15 bolus technique, we measured regional distribution of cerebral blood flow (CBF) in eight healthy human volunteers. They were scanned under five different levels of propofol anesthesia. Using a computer-controlled infusion, the following plasma levels of propofol were targeted: Level W (Waking, 0 mug/ml), Level 1 (0.5 mug/ml), Level 2 (1.5 mug/ml), Level 3 (3.5 mug/ml), and Level R (Recovery). At each level of anesthesia, two 3-min scans were acquired with vibrotactile stimulation of the right forearm either on or off. The level of consciousness was evaluated before each scan by the response of the subject to a verbal command. At Level W, all volunteers were fully awake. They reported being slightly drowsy at Level 1, they had a slurred speech and slow response at Level 2, and they were not responding at all at Level 3. The following variations in regional CBF (rCBF) were observed. During the waking state (Level W), vibrotactile stimulation induced a significant rCBF increase in the left thalamus and in several cortical regions, including the left primary somatosensory cortex and the left and right secondary somatosensory cortex. During anesthesia, propofol reduced in a dose-dependent manner rCBF in the thalamus as well as in a number of visual, parietal, and prefrontal cortical regions. At Level 1 through 3, propofol also suppressed vibration-induced increases in rCBF in the primary and secondary somatosensory cortex, whereas the thalamic rCBF response was abolished only at Level 3, when volunteers lost consciousness. We conclude that propofol interferes with the processing of vibrotactile information first at the level of the cortex before attenuating its transfer through the thalamus.

The mean spontaneous firing rate of midbrain dorsal raphe 5-HT neurons was recorded in chloral hydrate-anesthetized mice. The serotonin transporter (5-HTT), which plays a key role in the regulation of serotonin was significantly decreased in homozygous mice lacking the 5-HT transporter (5-HTT-/-) by 66% and in heterozygous (5-HTT +/-) mice by 36% compared with their normal littermates (5-HTT +/-). Systemic injection of the selective 5-HT1A receptor antagonist WAY 100635 enhanced 5-HT neuronal firing by 127% in 5-HT -/- mice, thus indicating an enhanced synaptic availability of 5-HT at inhibitory 5-HT1A receptors. Nevertheless, the cell body 5-HT1A autoreceptors were desensitized in both 5-HTT -/- and 5-HTT +/- mice. At the postsynaptic level, the recovery time (RT50)of the firing rate of hippocampus CA(3) pyramidal neurons following iontophoretic applications of 5-HT was significantly prolonged only in 5-HTT -/- mice. The selective 5-HT reuptake inhibitor paroxetine significantly prolonged the RT50 in 5-HTT +/+ and 5-HTT +/- mice, without altering the maximal inhibitory effect of 5-HT. These neurons in 5-HTT -/- mice showed an attenuated response to the 5-HT1A agonist 8-hydroxy-2-diproplyaminotetralin, but not to 5-HT itself. These results establish that the lack of 5-HTT causes a prolonged recovery of firing activity following 5-HT applications. The genetic deletion of the 5-HTT plays a key role on 5-HT1A receptor adaptation: a desensitization at pre- and postsynaptic levels in 5-HTT -/- mice, but to a different extent, and only at the presynaptic level in the 5-HTT +/- group.

Unlike auditory receptor neurons of many animals, cricket ARFs fall into three distinct populations based on characteristic frequency (CF) [Imaizumi and Pollack, J. Neurosci. 19, 1508-1516 (1999)]. Two of these have CFs similar to the frequency component of communication signals or of ultrasound produced by predators, and a third population has intermediate CF. Here, sound-amplitude coding by ARFs is examined to gain insights to how behaviorally relevant sounds are encoded by populations of receptor neurons. ARFs involved in acoustic communication comprise two distinct anatomical types, which also differ in physiological parameters (threshold, response slope, dynamic range, minimum latency, and sharpness of tuning). Thus, based on CE; and anatomy, ARFs comprise four populations. Physiological parameters are diverse, but within each population they are systematically related to threshold. The details of these relationships differ among the four populations. These findings open the possibility that different ARF populations differ in functional organization.

The aim of this study was to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying BF-I functions. It is shown here that BF-I interacts in vivo dth global transcriptional corepressors of the Groucho family and also associates with the histone deacetylase 1 protein. The ability of BF-1 to mediate transcriptional repression is promoted by Groucho and inhibited by the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A, suggesting that BF-1 recruits Groucho and histone deacetylase activities to repress transcription. Our studies also provide the first demonstration that Groucho mediates a specific interaction between BF-I and the basic helix-loop-helix protein Hes1 and that BF-1 potentiates transcriptional repression by Hes1 in a Groucho-dependent manner. These findings suggest that Groucho participates in the transcriptional functions of BF-I by acting as both a corepressor and an adapter between BF-1 and Heel. Taken together with the demonstration that these proteins are coexpressed in telencephalic neural progenitor cells, these results also suggest that complexes of BF-1, Groucho, and Hes factors may be involved in the regulation of progenitor cell differentiation in the telencephalon.

The present study investigated the orbitofrontal sulci in 100 normal adult human cerebral hemispheres using magnetic resonance images that were transformed into the standardized proportional stereotaxic space most commonly used, that of Talairach and Tournoux (1988). Four orbitofrontal sulci were identified and marked on each hemisphere: the olfactory, the medial, the lateral, and the transverse orbital sulci. Probability maps were then constructed for each sulcus. These maps provide a statistical description of the variability of the Location of each orbitofrontal sulcus within the three-dimensional coordinate system of Talairach and Tournoux (1988). These probability maps may be directly compared with any image transformed into the same standardized space, providing a valuable tool for identifying and describing the location of functional or structural changes in the orbitofrontal region of the human brain, (C) 2001 Academic Press.

Key steps in the death pathway include c-Jun activation, mitochondrial cytochrome c release, and caspase activation. Here, we show that neurons rescued from NGF withdrawal-induced apoptosis by expression of dominant-negative c-Jun do not release cytochrome c from their mitochondria. Furthermore, we find that the mRNA for BIM(EL), a proapoptotic BCL-2 family member, increases in level after NGF withdrawal and that this is reduced by dominant-negative c-Jun. Finally, overexpression of BIM(EL) in neurons induces cytochrome c redistribution and apoptosis in the presence of NGF, and neurons injected with sim antisense oligonucleotides or isolated from Bim(-/-) knockout mice die more slowly after NGF withdrawal.

The receptors that mediate the actions of ATP belong to two classes, the metabotropic P2Y receptors and the transmitter-gated, ion channel P2X receptors. This review describes the structure, distribution, function, and ligand recognition characteristics of P2X receptors, which comprise seven distinct subunits that can function as both homo- and hetero-polymers. The pharmacology of P2X receptors is complicated by marked differences between species orthologues. The current nomenclature is based largely on recombinant receptor studies and detailed knowledge of endogenous P2X receptors in native tissues is limited because of lack of good selective agonists and antagonists for each receptor type.

The evaluation of drug naive patients discards the potential influence of medication, and may allow the specification of cognitive impairments that are truly illness-related. Subcomponents of long-term memory as well as several measures of attention were examined. A group of 16 patients who had never taken antipsychotics and a group of 20 normal controls underwent tests of alertness, information maintaining, and sustained and selective attention, as well as tests of explicit and implicit recall. The psychopathological manifestations of patients were also assessed with the BPRS, PANSS, ESRS clinical scales. Attention test performances revealed that drug naive patients presented a decrease in their ability to respond promptly to a stimulus, sustain their attention on a task, display normal selective attention strategies, and maintain information for on-line processing. The results also suggest that the drug naive patients are impaired when both strategic and associative processes must be triggered to explicitly recover information in long-term memory. In contrast, the results revealed that implicit access to perceptual mental representations is spared in schizophrenic patients. Finally, features of the patients' clinical symptomatology and some cognitive deficits were also shown to be correlated. Overall, results showed that, in relation to normals, drug naive patients were mildly impaired, with little intersubject variability, and that not all cognitive processes were equally disturbed in relation to the normal subjects' performances. Results support the idea that an important part of the impairments seen in schizophrenia is present before the introduction of neuroleptic medication and chronic illness.

Methods: In a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, dose-ranging study, the authors assessed the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of the glutamate receptor blocker remacemide hydrochloride in 279 patients with motor fluctuations treated with levodopa. The primary objective was to assess the short-term tolerability and safety of four dosage levels of remacemide during 7 weeks of treatment. Patients were also monitored with home diaries and the Unified PD Rating Scale (UPDRS) to collect preliminary data on treatment efficacy. Results: Remacemide was well tolerated up to a dosage of 300 mg/d on a twice daily schedule and 600 mg/d on a four times daily schedule. The most common dosage-related adverse events were dizziness and nausea, as observed in previous studies of remacemide. The percent "on" time and motor UPDRS scores showed trends toward improvement in the patients treated with 150 and 300 mg/d remacemide compared with placebo-treated patients, although these improvements were not significant. Conclusion: Remacemide is a safe and tolerable adjunct to dopaminergic therapy for patients with PD and motor fluctuations. Although this study had limited power to detect therapeutic effects, the observed improvement is consistent with studies of non-human primates with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine-induced parkinsonian signs and symptoms. Additional studies are warranted to confirm these results over an extended period of observation, and to explore the potential neuroprotective effects of remacemide in slowing the progression of PD.

At the frog neuromuscular junction (nmj), exogenous application of NO reduces neurotransmitter release, and NO synthases (NOSs), the enzymes producing NO, are present at this synapse. This work aimed at studying the molecular mechanisms by which NO modulates synaptic efficacy at the nmj using electrophysiological recordings and Ca2+-imaging techniques. Bath application of the NO donors S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP) and sodium nitroprusside decreased end plate potential (EPP) amplitude as well as the frequency of miniature EPPs but not their amplitude. Ca2+ responses elicited in presynaptic terminals by single action potentials were unaffected by NO, but responses evoked by a short train of stimuli were increased. Tonic endogenous production of NO was observed as suggested by the increase in EPP amplitude by bath application of the NO scavenger hemoglobin and the neuronal NOS inhibitor 3-bromo-7-nitroindazole sodium salt. A soluble guanylate cyclase inhibitor, 6-anilino5,8-quinolinedione (LY-83583), increased EPP amplitude and occluded the effects of the NO donor, suggesting that NO acts via a cGMP-dependent mechanism. High-frequency-induced depression was reduced in the presence of the NO scavenger but not by LY-83583. However, adenosine-induced depression was significantly reduced after bath perfusion of SNAP and in the presence of LY-83583. Our results indicate that NO regulates transmitter release and adenosine-induced depression via a cGMP-dependent mechanism that occurs after Ca2+ entry and that high-frequency-induced synaptic depression is regulated by NO in a cGMP-independent manner.

In contrast, at depressed Aplysia sensory to motor synapses, 5-HT facilitates transmitter release primarily through a protein kinase C (PKC)-dependent pathway. It is known that only two phorbol ester-activated PKC isoforms, the Ca2+-dependent PKC Apl I and the Ca2+-independent PKC Apl II, exist in the Aplysia nervous system. For the first time, we have now been able to functionally determine which isoform of PKC is involved in a particular form of plasticity. We microinjected cultured sensorimotor pairs of neurons with various PKC constructs tagged with the enhanced green fluorescent protein as a reporter for successful plasmid expression. Our results demonstrate that short-term facilitation of depressed synapses is mediated by PKC Apl II. Dominant-negative PKC Apl II, but not dominant-negative PKC Apl I, disrupted the normal kinetics of 5-HT-induced facilitation by completely blocking its rapid onset. This effect was specific to depressed synapses, because dominant-negative PKC Apl II did not inhibit 5-HT-mediated facilitation of nondepressed synapses. Our results suggest that not only different signal transduction pathways but also different isoforms of a specific cascade may mediate physiological responses according to the state of a synapse.

Antisense oligonucletides for the UPAR mRNA or an antibody directed against UPAR protein, added simultaneously with NGF, block NGF-induced morphological and biochemical differentiation of PC12 cells. In this report, we show that anti-UPAR antibody blocks morphological differentiation and the expression of two NGF-specific secondary response genes, collagenase-1 and transin, in PC12 cells only during the first 2 hr following NGF exposure. These data suggest that induced UPAR expression is required only over a short period of time following exposure to NGF for the differentiation program in PC12 cells to proceed. For two models of "primed" PC12 cells, we found that UPAR expression and function are not required for NGF-induced differentiation. UPAR and the secondary response genes collagenase-1 and transin are not induced in "primed" PC12 cells in response to NGF, and anti-UPAR antibody does not block morphological differentiation in these cells. Our data suggests that UPAR is required only transiently during the "priming" of PC12 cells in NGF-induced PC12 cell differentiation. (C) 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

A model is proposed based on a multicompartment approach; each compartment represents an organ or a group of organs or an excreta. The model translates into a set of coupled differential equations taking into account interorgan rates of exchanges and excretion together with the biotransformation process. The free parameters of the model are determined from statistical fits to the experimental data of the Farris ef al. (Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 119, 74-90, 1993) study on the time profiles of blood and tissue concentrations and cumulative excretions. The vast range of time scales that govern tissue absorption, distribution, biotransformation, and excretion served to solve the model step by step. This interplay of time scales in the rates explains the buildups and slow attrition of inorganic mercury in certain key organs such as the brain and the kidney, which are also the sites of the more important toxic effects. The model was validated on additional experimental data provided by Norseth and Clarkson (Arch. Environ. Health 21, 717-727, 1970) and Thomas et al. (Environ. Res. 41, 219-234, 1986; Environ. Res. 43, 203-216, 1987), This approach, when adapted to humans, allows the reconstruction of the time course of blood and tissue concentrations, starting from easily accessible data on hair, urine, and feces (see companion article by Carrier et al.

The model conceptual and functional representation was similar to that used for rats but relevant data on humans served to determine the critical parameters of the kinetic behavior. It was found that the metabolic rate of methyl mercury was on average 3 to 3.5 times slower in humans than in rats. Also, excretion rates of organic mercury from the whole body into feces and hair were 100 and 40 times smaller in humans, respectively, and urinary excretion of organic mercury in humans was found to be negligible. The human transfer rate of inorganic mercury from blood to hair was found to be 5 times lower than that of rats. On the other hand, retention of inorganic mercury in the kidney appeared more important in humans than in rats: the transfer rate of inorganic mercury from blood to kidney was 19 times higher than in rats and that from kidney to blood 19 times smaller. The excretion rate of inorganic mercury from the kidney to urine in humans was found to be twice that of rats. With these model parameters, simulations accurately predicted human kinetic data available in the published literature for different exposure scenarios. The model relates quantitatively mercury species in biological matrices (blood, hair, and urine) to the absorbed dose and tissue burden at any point in time. Thus, accessible measurements on these matrices allow inferences of past, present, and future burdens. This could prove to be a useful tool in assessing the health risks associated with various circumstances of methyl mercury exposure. (C) 2001 Academic Press.

Sorting of secretory proteins takes place in the trans-Golgi network (sorting for entry) or immature secretory granules (sorting by retention). The relative contribution of these sorting steps and the sorting signals and mechanisms involved in each step has been the subject of intense studies and debate in recent years. New evidence now suggests that: (1) two proteins with structurally similar sorting signals can use different sorting mechanisms; (2) one protein with multiple sorting signals can be sorted differently in different cell types; and (3) one cell type can recognize different sorting signals and use different sorting mechanisms. The latter finding suggests that sorting must be a regulated event. While the current image of sorting is complex, recent findings are pointing to common features that form a mosaic of related sorting mechanisms. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

J	Pepio, AM; Sossin, WS				Pepio, AM; Sossin, WS			Membrane translocation of novel protein kinase Cs is regulated by phosphorylation of the C2 domain	JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							APLYSIA SENSORY NEURONS; LONG-TERM FACILITATION; PHORBOL ESTER BINDING; APL-II; TYROSINE PHOSPHORYLATION; CRYSTAL-STRUCTURE; ACTIVATION; DELTA; CELLS; ALPHA	Ca2+-independent or novel protein kinase Cs (nPKCs) contain an N-terminal C2 domain of unknown function. Removal of the C2 domain of the Aplysia nPKC Apl II allows activation of the enzyme at lower concentrations of phosphatidylserine, suggesting an inhibitory role far the C2 domain in enzyme activation. However, the mechanism for Ca domain-mediated inhibition is not known. Mapping of the autophosphorylation sites for protein kinase C (PRC) ApI II reveals four phosphopeptides in the regulatory domain of PRC ApI II, two of which are in the C2 domain at serine 2 and serine 36. Unlike most PKC autophosphorylation sites, these serines could be phosphorylated in trans. Interestingly, phosphorylation of serine 36 increased binding of the C2 domain to phosphatidylserine membranes in vitro. In cells, PRC Apl II phosphorylation at serine 36 was increased by PKC activators, and PKC phosphorylated at this position translocated more efficiently to membranes. Moreover, mutation of serine 36 to alanine significantly reduced membrane translocation of PKC Apl II. We suggest that translocation of nPKCs is regulated by phosphorylation of the C2 domain.

The mechanism of 5-HT1A receptor induction by B and T cell mitogens at the mRNA and protein levels in mouse splenocytes was addressed. Quantitation by RNase protection assay showed maximal increases of 3.4-, 3.0-, 3.8-, and 4.9-fold in relative 5-HT1A mRNA levels after 48 h of stimulation of splenocytes with Lipopolysaccharide, phytohemagglutinin, concanavalin A, or phorbol la-myristate 13-acetate plus ionomycin, respectively as compared with unstimulated cells. Mitogens did not alter 5-HT1A mRNA stability (t(1/2) = 26 h), but induction of 5-HT1A mRNA was blocked by the transcriptional inhibitor actinomycin D (10 mug/ml) and by inhibition of nuclear factor-kappaB signaling. Additionally, mitogenic stimulation of transcription was paralleled by increased cell surface 5-HT1A receptor immunoreactivity in splenocytes. Thus, mitogen-induced 5-HT, receptor expression appears to involve transcriptional regulation by the nuclear factor-kappaB signaling cascade. Increased expression of the 5-HT1A receptor in activated B and T lymphocytes may enhance the immune response and provide therapeutic target for tissue inflammation and immune stimulation.

Although this test is frequently the gold standard for the evaluation of neurocardiogenic syncope, dysautonomia and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, there is a debate over its diagnostic value and method. The authors review the physiologic basis of the HUT test, the method, patterns of response, indications and contraindications, and diagnostic validity. Despite its limitations, the HUT test is useful in patients with a variety of clinical manifestations induced by orthostatism. it is most useful in documenting objective measures of orthostatic hypertension that cannot be obtained in a clinical setting.

Defects in the DAP complex have been linked previously to a variety of muscular dystrophies, Other evidence points to a role for the DAP complex in formation of nerve-muscle synapses. We show that myotubes differentiated from dystroglycan(-/-) embryonic stem cells are responsive to agrin, but produce acetyl choline receptor (AChR) clusters which are two to three times larger in area, about half as dense, and significantly less stable than those on dystroglycan+/+ myotubes, AChRs at neuromuscular junctions are similarly affected in dystroglycan-deficient chimeric mice and there is a coordinate increase in nerve terminal size at these junctions. In culture and in vivo the absence of dystroglycan disrupts the localization to AChR clusters of laminin, perlecan, and acetylcholinesterase (AChE), but not rapsyn or agrin. Treatment of myotubes in culture with laminin induces AChR clusters on dystroglycan+/+, but not -/- myotubes, These results suggest that dystroglycan is essential for the assembly of a synaptic basement membrane, most notably by localizing AChE through its binding to perlecan, In addition. they suggest that dystroglycan functions in the organization and stabilization of AChR clusters, which appear to be mediated through its binding of laminin.

The cloning of the MJD1 gene allowed identification of the disease in many other populations, and MJD is now known to be the most common cause of dominant spinocerebellar ataxia. The hypothesis that its present world distribution could result from the spread of an original founder mutation has been raised, both at historical and molecular levels. In the present study, we tested this hypothesis by linkage-disequilibrium analysis of tightly linked polymorphisms and by haplotype comparison, in 249 families from different countries. We typed five microsatellite markers surrounding the MJD1 locus (D14S1015, D14S995, D14S973, D14S1016, and D14S977), and three intragenic single-base-pair polymorphisms ((A) under bar (669)TG/(G) under bar (669)TG, (C) under bar (987)GG/(G) under bar (987)GG, and TA (A) under bar (1118) /TA (C) under bar (1118)). The results show two different haplotypes, specific to the island of origin, in families of Azorean extraction. In families from mainland Portugal, both Azorean haplotypes can be found. The majority of the non-Portuguese families also share the same intragenic haplotype seen in the families coming from the island of Flores, but at least three other haplotypes were seen. These findings suggest two introductions of the mutation into the Portuguese population. Worldwide, the sharing of one intragenic haplotype by the majority of the families studied implies a founder mutation in MJD.

The magnitude of shortening of failing cardiomyocytes was significantly depressed (by 22 +/- 4.4%) under basal conditions, and the maximal response to isoproterenol was significantly reduced (by 45 +/- 18%). Similar results were obtained when the responses in the rate of contraction and rate of relaxation to isoproterenol were considered. The L-type Ca2+ current amplitude measured in failing cardiomyocytes under basal conditions was unchanged, but the responses to isoproterenol were significantly reduced compared with healthy cells. Isoproterenol-stimulated cAMP generation was similar in sarcolemmal membranes derived from the homogenates of failing (45 +/- 6.8) and healthy cardiomyocytes (52 +/- 8.5 pmol cAMP. mg protein(-1) . min(-1)). However, stimulated cAMP generation was found to be significantly reduced when the membranes were derived from the homogenates of whole tissue (failing: 67 +/- 8.1 vs. healthy: 140 +/- 27.8 pmol cAMP.mg protein(-1).min(-1)). Total beta -AR density was not reduced in membranes derived from either whole tissue or isolated cardiomyocyte homogenates, but the beta (1)/beta (2) ratio was significantly reduced in the former (faitachycardia-induced heart failure, reduction in the functional responses of isolated cardiomyocytes to beta -AR stimulation may be attributed to alterations in the excitation-contraction machinery rather than to limitation of cAMP generation.

The review begins with a brief description of the nature of the MR signal and its possible biological underpinnings, and proceeds with a description of MR findings obtained in newborns, infants, children and adolescents. On MR images, a significant decrease in water content leads to a decrease of longitudinal relaxation times (T1) and transverse relaxation times (T2) and consequent "adult-like" appearance of T1-weighted and T2-weighted images becomes evident towards the end of the first year of life. Owing to the onset of myelination and the related increase of lipid content, MR images gradually acquire an exquisite grey-white matter contrast in a temporal sequence reflecting the time course of myelination. Albeit less pronounced, age-related changes in white matter continue during childhood and adolescence; white matter increases its overall volume and becomes more myelinated in a region-specific fashion. Detection of more subtle changes during this "late" phase of brain development is greatly aided by computational analyses of MR images. The review also briefly outlines future directions, including the use of novel MR techniques such as diffusion tenser imaging and magnetization transfer, as well as the suggestion for the concurrent use of experimental behavioral test-batteries, with structural MR imaging, to study developmental changes in structure-function relationships.

Thus the: measure of synchronization becomes an important issue since it may be an electrophysiological sign of visual perception. This paper describes: and compares six techniques of computing synchronization strength, that is, the central peak of a coss-correlogram, Data were obtained in anesthetized cats prepared for electrophysiological recordings in a conventional fashion. Results indicate that: (1) eye fits are misleading. Visual inspection of cross-correlograms, may be interesting if one needs to estimate approximately synchronization strength and the presence of oscillations in the cross-correlograms, however it may be misleading if one wants to compare different cross-correlograms; (2) regression analysis to compare one method against the others yields a relatively poor correlation suggesting that methods are not directly comparable; (3) the sensitivity of each computational method is unequal. The results may indicate that som functional connections are either under- or over-evaluated depending upon the strategy employed to measure synchronization. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Methods: Molecular analysis was performed by nonisotopic single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis and sequencing. Clinical evaluation was carried out according to the scale defined by the European Hereditary Motor and Sensory Neuropathy Consortium. Results: In one family, the mutation Arg142Trp was located in the transmembrane domain III whereas, in four other families we identified a novel mutation (Ser26Trp) located in the transmembrane domain I of the connexin 32 gene. Haplotype analysis revealed that these four families are related and suggests a founder mutation. Sixteen patients from these four families were studied. As expected, all the affected males were more clinically affected than the females and all affected patients exhibited some electrophysiological characteristics of demyelination, Conclusion: Our study suggests that the Ser26Trp mutation may cause a primary demyelinating neuropathy that is not associated with a specific clinical phenotype. We also find evidence that the majority of kindreds share a common ancestor.

The median survival in patients harboring this neoplasm is 12 months irrespective of any form of therapy, Health case costs of illnesses with high mortality rates, such as GEM, are of particular interest in times of constrained health care resources. No information regarding costs for the treatment of patients with GEM is available in Canada. The aim of this study was to conduct an analysis of the costs of treatment of GEM in Nova Scotia, Methods: Patients with histologically proven GEM during a three year period (1996-1998) in Nova Scotia were included in the study. Analysis was based on hospital costs supplemented by data on additional medical services received following discharge for the primary intervention. Results: The mean cost of medical care per patient from the time of diagnosis to death was $17,149. The highest costs were related to hospitalization with ward costs alone accounting for 48% of all costs. Radiotherapy costs were 25%, surgery costs were 16% and chemotherapy costs were 7% of all costs. Costs for diagnostic procedures were 6% of the total costs. Conclusion: Our data reflect the costs and practice pattern in the treatment of GEM in Nova Scotia and may be of value as an initial attempt to analyze costs of treatment of GEM in Canada.

This review paper formed a background paper for their discussion of dementia diagnosis. These experts from across the country concluded that diagnosis of suspected dementia cases continued to rest on skilled clinical assessment. Mental status exam, preferably in some quantifiable form, has become an essential part of the assessment. Selected laboratory tests are advisable in all cases (CBC, TSH, electrolytes, calcium, and glucose), but the CCCD continued to advise that CT scanning was mandatory only in selected cases where clinical findings pointed to another possibility besides Alzheimer's disease. The growing list of other diagnostic measures with potential usefulness in diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease or dementia in general was reviewed. but the evidence was judged as insufficient to support routine use of these tests by physicians. As new treatments for Alzheimer's disease become available, neurologists face new diagnostic challenges - differentiating Mild Cognitive Impairment, Frontotemporal dementias and Mixed dementias, and Lewy Body Dementia. Guidelines to aid in differential diagnosis are presented.

Options: Structured approach to assessment, including recommended laboratory tests, choices for neuroimaging and referral; management of complications (especially behaviour problems and depression) and use of cognitive enhancing agents. Potential outcomes: Consistent and improved clinical care of persons with dementia; cost containment by more selective use of laboratory investigations, neuroimaging and referrals; appropriate use of cognitive enhancing agents. Evidence: Authors of each background paper were entrusted to: perform a literature search, discover additional relevant material including references cited in retrieved articles; consult with other experts in the field and then synthesize information. Standard rules of evidence were applied. Based upon this evidence, consensus statements were developed by a group of experts, guided by a steering committee of eight individuals from the areas of Neurology, Geriatric Medicine, Psychiatry, Family Medicine, Preventive Health Care and Health Care Systems. Values: Recommendations have been developed with particular attention to the context of primary care and are intended to support family physicians in their ongoing assessment and care of patients with dementia, Benefits, harms and costs: Potential for improved clinical care of individuals with dementia, A dissemination and evaluation strategy will attempt to measure the impact of the recommendations. Recommendations: See text. Validation: Four other sets of consensus statements and/or guidelines have been published recently. These recommendations are generally congruent with our own consensus statements. The consensus statements have been endorsed by relevant bodies in Canada. Sponsors: Funding was provided by equal contributions from seven pharmaceutical companies and by a grant from the Consortium of Canadian Centres for Clinical Cognitive Research (C5R). Contributions were received from two Canadian universities (McGill, McMaster), Several societies supported delegates to the conference.

This is a result of altered expression of connexins, the proteins that mediate GJIC, including connexin 43 (Cx43). Our aim was to evaluate the effect of known inducers of Cx43 on the chemosensitivity of the human neuroblastoma cell line IMR-32 to chemotherapeutic agents. Methods: We examined the effect of dibutyryl-cyclic AMP (db-cAMP) and all-tr ans-retinoic acid (tRA) on Cx43 and GJIC, glutathione (GSH) and gamma -glutamyl-cysteine-synthetase (gamma -GCS) levels, and glutathione S-transferase (GST) activity. Finally, we performed cell survival assays to measure the response of IMR-32 cells to the chemotherapeutic drugs doxorubicin, melphalan and bis-chloronitrosourea (BCNU), after treatment with db-cAMP and/or tRA. Results: Exposure to db-cAMP led to the upregulation of GJIC and Cx43 expression and phosphorylation. On the other hand, exposure to tRA led to the upregulation of GJIC but Cx43 expression and phosphorylation were not greatly affected. The combination of both agents was more potent in inducing GJIC in comparison to treatment with db-cAMP or tRA alone. Treatment with db-cAMP, but not with tRA, was associated with a significant increase in the cytotoxic effects of the anticancer drugs doxorubicin, melphalan and BCNU as shown by a decrease in their IC50 values. Concomitant exposure to db-cAMP and tRA, however, had a more pronounced effect on cell sensitization to chemotherapy drugs (particularly doxorubicin) than exposure to db-cAMP or tRA alone. Under the db-cAMP and tRA treatment conditions (which upregulate GJIC and modulate drug response), GSH levels were significantly reduced while the levels of GST and gamma -GCS activities remained unchanged. Conclusions: This study suggests that GJIC plays a role in cellular drug resistance, and highlights the potential use of GJIC modulators in combination with chemotherapy. Also, this is the first study exploring the ability of both db-cAMP and tRA to enhance cell chemosensitivity.

We performed physiologic and histochemical studies to further understand how the GHS system interacts with the well-established somatostatin (SRIF)/growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) neuroendocrine system for regulating pulsatile GH secretion. Comparison of the GH-releasing activities of the hexapeptide growth hormone-releasing peptide-6 (GHRP-6) and GHRH administered intravenously to conscious adult male rats showed that the pattern of GH responsiveness to GHRP-6 was markedly time-dependent, similar to that observed with GHRH, Immunoneutralization of endogenous SRIF reversed the blunted GH response to GHRP-6 at trough times, suggesting that GHRP-6 neither disrupts nor inhibits the cyclical release of endogenous hypothalamic SRIF, By striking contrast, passive immunization with anti-GHRH serum virtually obliterated the GH responses to GHRP-6, irrespective of the time of administration. These findings suggest that the GHSs do not act by altering SRIF release but, rather, stimulate GH release via GHRH-dependent pathways. Our dual chromogenic and autoradiographic in situ hyhridization experiments revealed that a subpopulation of GHRH mRNA-containing neurons in the arcuate (Arc) nucleus and ventromedial nucleus (VMN) of the hypothalamus expressed the GHS receptor (GHS-R) gene. These results provide strong anatomic evidence that GHSs may directly stimulate GHRH release into hypophyseal portal blood, and thereby influence GH secretion, through interaction with the GHS-R on GHRH- containing neurons. Altogether, these findings support the notion that an additional neuroendocrine pathway may exist to regulate pulsatile GH secretion, possibly through the influence of the newly discovered GHS natural peptide, ghrelin.

Whether lactation alters preproTRH processing resulting in the generation of novel proTRH-derived peptides that may be involved in the regulation of PRL secretion lactation is not known. Therefore, in the present study we determine whether some other peptides derived from proTRH potentially contribute to lactation-induced PRL secretion. We have recently demonstrated that two members of the family of prohormone convertases PC1 and PC2 play a significant role in proTRH processing. PC1 is the major contributor in proTRH processing, whereas PC2 may have a specific role in cleaving TRH from its extended forms. In this study, we used a recombinant vaccinia virus system to coexpress rat preproTRH complementary DNA with PC1, PC2, and the neuropeptide 7B2 in GH4C1 cells (somatomammothophs, rat). We found that two novel peptides, preproTRH(178-184) (pFQ(7)), and preproTRH(186-199) (pSE(14)), were formed after the cleavage of their precursor preproTRH(178-199) (pFE(22)) by only PC2. Their formation was confirmed by microsequence analysis. Anatomical analyses revealed that these peptides are also found in the rat PVN. In addition, we found that pFE(22), pSE(14) and pFQ(7) produced a dose-dependent release of PRL from primary cultures of pituitary cells compared with one of the well studied secretagogues of PRL, TRH. To establish whether these peptides might play a role in vivo in the regulation of PRL release, we took rat litters on postnatal day 4, separated the pups from their mothers for 6 h, and then reunited the pups and mothers for 45 min. At the end of this period, the mothers were killed, acidic extracts of microdissected PVN were prepared and subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by slicing and analysis by pFE(22) RIA. Forty-five minutes of suckling induced a marked B-fold increase in serum levels of PRL. In addition, PVN levels of pFE(22) and pSE(14) increased approximately B-fold during the same period in the acutely suckling females. Lactating animals that were separated from their litters and never reunited with their pups had low levels of PRL, and pFE(22) and pSE(14). These data provide the first evidence for alterations in proTRH processing in the PVN during lactation and suggest that the products of this altered processing may play a physiological role in the regulation of PRL secretion.

The computer networks considered are packet switching networks. modeled as non-oriented graphs where nodes represent servers, hosts or switches, while bi-directional and symmetric arcs represent full duplex communication links. The proposed method is based on a network representation enabling to match each network configuration with a Hopfield neural network in order to find the best path between any node pair by minimizing an energy function. The results show that the time delay derived from Row assignment carried out by this approach is, in most cases, better than those determined using conventional routing heuristics. Therefore, this neural-network approach is suitable to be integrated into an overall topological design process of moderate-speed and high-speed networks subject to quality of service constraints as well as to changes in configuration and link costs.

Methods: We performed pre- and postoperative H-1-MRSI in 16 seizure-free (SF) patients and 16 not seizure-free (NSF) TLE patients. We calculated a mixed-design analysis of variance (ANOVA) between SF and NSF groups, ipsi- and contralateral to the side of operation, and pre- and postoperative NAA/Cr measurements. We applied nonlinear regression be tween pre- and postoperative NAA/Cr differences and the time interval between H-1-MRSI scans to fit a negative exponential model to NAA recovery. Results: Mixed-design ANOVA revealed that (a) postoperative NAA/Cr was significantly higher in SF than in NSF patients (p = 0.02) and that (b) in the SF group. postoperative NAA/Cr values were significantly higher than preoperative values (p < 0.05) and returned to the normal range in most patients. According to our nonlinear regression model, in SF patients, there was a 50% increase relative to preoperative NAA/Cr values after 5.8 months, whereas an improvement of 95% was reached after 25 months. Conclusions: Our results extend preliminary observations of postoperative NAA recovery of SF patients by characterizing the time course of recovery as an exponential function with a half-time of <similar to>6 months. The reversal of neuronal metabolic dysfunction remote from the epileptic focus may underlie the clinical observation of improvement of cognitive dysfunction after successful epilepsy surgery.

Auditory filtering processes can be investigated at the peripheral level as they are hypothesized to involve active cochlear mechanisms which are regulated by the efferent activity of the medial olivocochlear (MOC) system. The aim of the present work was therefore to assess these peripheral auditory processes in 22 children and adolescents with autism compared with age- and gender-matched normal controls. Active cochlear mechanisms were evaluated with transiently evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAEs) and MOC system efficiency was assessed via TEOAEs which are decreased when stimulating the contralateral ear with noise. The MOC system evaluation was performed on 18 of the 22 children. In both studies, results were analysed according to age (from 4 to 10 years and from 11 to 20 years). The main result concerns the asymmetry of the efferent system which differs in individuals with autism. Several neural processes might be hypothesized as involved in the results obtained as the MOC system which originates in the brainstem received regulating controls from upper brain structures including auditory cortex. Lateralization abnormalities at the auditory periphery may reflect indirectly a problem at a higher level of auditory processing. A second important result shows a decrease in TEOAE amplitude with age, in patients, that may correspond to a decrease in hearing sensitivity.

Exposure to novel stimuli evoked investigatory activity and increased nucleus accumbens dopamine. Unilateral injections of the sodium channel blocker tetrodotoxin (0.16 ng/0.5 muL) into the ventral subiculum ipsilateral to the dialysed NAS abolished novelty-evoked elevations in dopamine. Injections of tetrodotoxin into the contralateral VS did not prevent novelty-evoked elevations in nucleus accumbens dopamine. Unilateral perfusion (via microdialysis) of the ionotropic glutamate receptor antagonists kynurenic acid (1 mm) into the ipsilateral but not the contralateral VTA blocked novelty-evoked elevations in nucleus accumbens dopamine. Neither unilateral injections of tetrodotoxin nor unilateral perfusion of kynurenic acid disrupted investigatory behaviour. These data indicate that phasic elevations in nucleus accumbens dopamine evoked by exposure to unconditioned novel stimuli are dependent on impulse flow from the hippocampus and glutamatergic transmission in the VTA.

J	Suissa, S; Harder, S; Veilleux, M				Suissa, S; Harder, S; Veilleux, M			The relation between initial symptoms and signs and the prognosis of whiplash	EUROPEAN SPINE JOURNAL			English	Article						cervical spine; epidemiology; motor vehicle accident; prognosis; soft tissue injury; trauma	INJURY	Whiplash, a common injury following motor vehicle crashes, is associated with high costs and a prognosis that is variable and difficult to predict. We studied the profile of recovery from whiplash and assessed whether presenting signs and symptoms directly after the crash were predictive of whiplash prognosis. We formed a population-based incident cohort of all 2627 individuals who sustained a whiplash injury resulting from a motor vehicle crash in the province of Quebec, Canada, in 1987, and followed these patients for up to 7 years. The data on signs and symptoms were obtained from the medical charts kept by the universal automobile insurance plan (Societe de l'assurance automobile du Quebec), which covers all 7 million residents of the province, while data on the outcome - the recovery time from whiplash - was obtained from their databases. The median recovery time was 32 days, and 12% of subjects had still not recovered after 6 months. The signs and symptoms that were found to be independently associated with a slower recovery from whiplash, besides female gender and older age, are neck pain on palpation, muscle pain, pain or numbness radiating from the neck to arms, hands or shoulders, and headache. Together, these factors in older females (age 60) predicted a median recovery time of 262 days, compared with 17 days for younger males (age 20) who do not have this profile. III contrast, using a classification of injury severity previously proposed by the Quebec Whiplash Associated Disorders Task Force, the median recovery time varied from 17 to only 123 days. We conclude that whiplash patients presenting with several specific musculoskeletal and neurological signs and symptoms will have a longer recovery period. These patients can easily be identified and closely monitored and targeted for the evaluation of early intervention programmes aimed at managing whiplash patients with a poor prognosis.

We report here the characterization of a microcrush lesion of the optic nerve made with 10-0 sutures to completely transect RGC axons. Following microcrush lesion, 62% of RGCs remained alive 1 week later, and 28% of RGCs, at 2 weeks. Optic nerve sections stained by hematoxylin-based methods showed a thin line of intensely stained cells that invaded the lesion site at 24 h after microcrush lesion. The lesion site became increasingly disorganized by 2 weeks after injury, and both macrophages and blood vessels invaded the lesion site. The microcrush lesion was immunoreactive for chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPG), and an adjacent GFAP-negative zone developed early after the lesion, disappearing by 1 week. Luxol fast blue staining showed a myelin-free zone at the lesion site, and myelin remained distal to the lesion at 8 weeks. To study the axonal response to microcrush lesion, anterograde tracing was used. Within 6 h after injury all RGC axone retracted back from the site of lesion. By 1 week after injury, axone regrew toward the lesion, but most stopped abruptly at the injury scar. The few axons that were able to cross the injury site did not extend further in the optic nerve white matter by 8 weeks postlesion, Our observations suggest that both the CSPG-positive scar and the myelin-derived growth inhibitory proteins contribute to the failure of RGC regeneration after injury.

It displays a pronounced clinical heterogeneity with mild to severe forms. The NF2 tumor suppressor (merlin/schwannomin) has been cloned and extensively analyzed for mutations in patients with different clinical variants of the disease. Correlation between the type of the NF2 gene mutation and the patient phenotype has been suggested to exist. However, several independent studies have shown that a fraction of NF2 patients with various phenotypes have constitutional deletions that partly or entirely remove one copy of the NF2 gene. The purpose of this study was to examine a 7 Mb interval in the vicinity of the NF2 gene in a large series of NF2 patients in order to determine the frequency and extent of deletions. A total of 116 NF2 patients were analyzed using high-resolution array-comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) on an array covering at least 90% of this region of 22q around the NF2 locus. Deletions, which remove one copy of the entire gene or are predicted to truncate the schwannomin protein, were detected in 8 severe, 10 moderate and 6 mild patients. This result does not support the correlation between the type of mutation affecting the NF2 gene and the disease phenotype.

The tasks consisted of free and cued recall of 15 semantically unrelated words in 3 encoding conditions: phonological encoding, semantic encoding, and a no encoding orientation. In both groups: semantic orientation led to better free recall than did orientation toward syllabic encoding or absence of orientation. In contrast, semantic cues at, retrieval led to better cued recall than phonological cues in typically developing individuals, whereas both types of cue had the same effect in prompting cued recall for individuals with autism. These findings are incompatible with the hypothesis of an amnesic deficit and do not support the notion of executive or semantic deficits in the memory problems of autistic individuals, at least for those with a high level of functioning. It is proposed that these findings can be accounted for by enhanced phonological processing in autism. This interpretation is consistent with other findings of enhanced processing of low-level perceptual information in the visual and auditory modality in autism.

Sixty-one extremely preterm (EP) very low birth weight (VLBW) children (< 29 wk and < 1500 g) born in 1987-1990 and 44 normal birth weight children (NBW) (> 37 wk and > 2500 g) were matched for age, sex, and socioeconomic status (SES). Mediator variables were evaluated at a hospital at 5 years and 9 months. Behaviors were evaluated at school at 7 years by peers, teachers, and parents. When compared with NEW children, EP/VLBW children had poorer IQ and neuromotor development. At school, EP/VLBW children were evaluated by peers as more sensitive/ isolated, and by teachers and parents as more inattentive and hyperactive than NEW. When mediators were introduced, the previously significant relation between prematurity and behavior problems disappeared. Hyperactive and inattentive behaviors were explained by a specific working memory factor for the fatter, and by a general intellectual delay for the former, whereas sensitive/isolated behaviors were best explained by neuromotor delays. Inattentive behaviors were also related to family adversity. At school age, extreme prematurity had thus an indirect effect on behaviors via specific and nonspecific intellectual and neuromotor delays.

J	Prentice, SD; Drew, T				Prentice, SD; Drew, T			Contributions of the reticulospinal system to the postural adjustments occurring during voluntary gait modifications	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article							MEDULLARY RETICULAR-FORMATION; INTACT UNANESTHETIZED CAT; MEDIAL LONGITUDINAL FASCICULUS; MOTOR CORTICAL ACTIVITY; UPPER-BODY BALANCE; BRAIN-STEM; SPINAL LESIONS; FUNCTIONAL-ORGANIZATION; DISCHARGE PATTERNS; THALAMIC CATS	To test the hypothesis that reticulospinal neurons (RSNs) are involved in the formation of the dynamic postural adjustments that accompany visually triggered, voluntary modifications of limb trajectory during locomotion, we recorded the activity of 400 cells (183 RSNs; 217 unidentified reticular cells) in the pontomedullary reticular formation (PMRF) during a locomotor task in which intact cats were required to step over an obstacle attached to a moving treadmill belt. Approximately one half of the RSNs (97/183, 53%) showed significant changes in cell activity as the cat stepped over the obstacle; most of these cells exhibited either single (26/97, 26.8%) or multiple (63/97, 65.0%) increases of activity. There was a range of discharge patterns that varied in the number, timing, and sequencing of the bursts of modified activity, although individual bursts in different cells tended to occur at similar phases of the gait cycle. Most modified cells, regardless of the number of bursts of increased discharge, or of the discharge activity of the cell during unobstructed, control, locomotion, discharged during the passage of the lead forelimb over the obstacle. Thus, 86.9% of the modified cells increased their discharge when the forelimb ipsilateral to the recording site was the first to pass over the obstacle, and 72.2% when the contralateral limb was the first. Approximately one quarter of the RSNs increased their discharge during the passage of each of the four limbs over the obstacle in both the lead (27.1%) and trail (27.9%) conditions. In general, in any one cell, the number and relative sequencing of the subsequent bursts (with respect to the lead forelimb) was maintained during both lead and trail conditions. Patterns of activity observed in unidentified cells were very similar to the RSN activity despite the diverse population of cells this unidentified group may represent. We suggest that the increased discharge that we observed in these reticular neurons reflects the integration of afferent activity from several sources, including the motor cortex, and that this increased discharge signals the timing and the relative magnitude of the postural patterns that accompany the voluntary gait modification. However, based on the characteristics of the patterns of neuronal activity in these cells, we further suggest that while individual RSNs probably contribute to the selection of different patterns of postural activity, the ultimate expression of the postural response may be determined by the excitability of the locomotor circuits within the spinal cord.

We have re-evaluated this observation in the frame of the hypothesis that contaminant heavy metals present in usual solutions may have lead to underestimate the affinity of the zinc binding site, and therefore to underestimate the potential physiological role of zinc. Using chelators either to complex heavy metals or to apply zinc at controlled concentrations, we have examined the action of zinc on GlyR kinetics in outside-out patches from 50-h-old zebrafish Mauthner cells. Chelating contaminating heavy metals with tricine or N,N,N',N'-tetrakis-(2-pyridylmethyl)-ethylenediamine (TPEN) decreased the duration of the currents evoked by glycine, confirming that traces of heavy metals alter the GlyR response in control conditions. Using tricine- (10 mM) buffered zinc solution, we then showed that zinc increases the amplitude of outside-out responses evoked by 0.1-0.5 mM glycine with an EC50 of 15 nM. In contrast zinc had no effect on the amplitude of currents evoked by a saturating concentration (3-10 mM) of glycine. This suggests that zinc enhances GlyR apparent affinity for glycine. The study of the effects of zinc on the kinetics of the response indicates that this increase of apparent affinity is due to a decrease of the glycine dissociation rate constant. We then analyzed the effects of zinc on postsynaptic GlyRs in whole cell recordings of glycinergic miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs). Chelation of contaminant heavy metals decreased the amplitude and the duration of the mIPSCs; inverse effects were observed by adding zinc in buffered solutions containing nanomolar free zinc concentrations. Zinc plus tricine or tricine alone did not change the coefficient of variation (approximate to0.85) of the mIPSC amplitude distributions. These results suggest that postsynaptic GlyRs are not saturated after the release of one vesicle.

We evaluated the distribution of regenerated retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axon terminals in the SC of adult hamsters in which an unbranched peripheral nerve graft was directed from the retina to the contralateral SC. Responses to visual stimulation of individual RGCs were recorded from terminal arbors of their regenerated axons in the reinnervated SC. Retinal positions of these RGCs were inferred from the locations of their visual receptive fields. At some sites in the reinnervated SC, axon terminal arbors converged from widely separated RGCs. Conversely, axon terminal arbors at widely separated sites in the SC could emanate from contiguous RGCs. To assess whether any tendency for order was superimposed on the apparent disorganization of the regenerated projection, we evaluated the relative positions of pairs of RGC terminals in the SC in relation to the relative retinal locations of the corresponding pairs of RGCs. Among the 983 pairs of RGCs able to be evaluated from nine animals studied 30-60 weeks after grafting, there was a statistically significant 3/2 tendency for the more nasally situated of two RGCs to project its terminal more caudally in the SC than that of the more temporally situated RGC. A similar tendency toward appropriate organization was not found with respect to the ventrodorsal axis of the retina and the mediolateral axis of the SC.

We hypothesized that a link model with the peripheral compartment would be more appropriate for mivacurium in view of its extremely rapid plasma clearance and its potential elimination by tissue pseudocholinesterases. For validation purposes, the peripheral link model was applied to other neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBA), i.e., atracurium and doxacurium which have respectively an intermediate and a long elimination half-life. Assuming peripheral elimination in PK-PD modeling was investigated but found to have no impact on the estimation of PK-PD parameters. Our results indicate that, for drugs having intermediate and long elimination half-lives, EC50 values are similar with either the central or peripheral link model. For mivacurium, a peripheral link model enables PK-PD modeling in all subjects, with more precision in the PK-PD parameter estimates and a better fitting of the effect data when compared to the central link model. For these reasons, a peripheral link model should be preferred for mivacurium.

Timing measures of inspiratory, expiratory, and total cycle duration were used to compare respiratory function during quiet breathing, listening, and speech. Cross-correlation analyses of the respiratory movements of conversational partners provided an index of conversational synchrony Inspiratory duration was found to be the most consistent and sensitive measure for discriminating quiet breathing from speech breathing. In the scripted dialog and spontaneous conversation conditions, respiratory kinematics changed during listening to more closely resemble speech, and systematic changes were observed in anticipation of turn-taking speech onset. For the breathing cycles immediately surrounding turn changes and simultaneously produced vocal events, the kinematic signals of conversational partners were strongly correlated. Results are discussed in the context of similar findings concerning conversational interactions and motor preparation for speech.

To evaluate the presence of nerve fibers and histopathology of normal peritoneum and endometriosis-harboring peritoneum. Design. Prospective, nonrandomized study (Canadian Task Force classification II-1). Setting. University hospital. Materials. Peritoneal specimen from 40 women with laparoscopic findings of endometriosis (24 confirmed histopathologically, group H, 16 diagnosed by laparoscopy, group L) and from 9 women with no endometriosis (controls). Intervention. Histopathologic examination of peritoneal specimens with nerve fibers identified by immunocytochemistry staining with an antibody to neurofilament. Measurements and Main Results. No differences in mean nerve score were seen among the three groups. Degrees of lymphocytic infiltration and mesothelial hyperplasia were higher in group H than in the other two groups (p <0.01 and <0.05, respectively). The degree of lymphocytic infiltration was significantly higher in group L than in the control group (p <0.05). There were no differences in all measurements between women in group H who experienced chronic pelvic pain and those who did not. Conclusion. The presence of nerve fibers in peritoneum is not related to endometriosis. Endometriosis-harboring peritoneum contains more lymphocytic infiltration than normal peritoneum.

Analysis of the expression pattern, together with DNA binding assays, suggests that this gene product might be important for differentiated oligodendrocyte function and in the regulation of myelin gene expression. We now report on the cloning and characterization of the human homolog (NKX6B). DNA sequence analysis of an 11-kb genomic fragment revealed that the complete human gene spans 1.2 kb and is composed of three exons. NKX6B is predicted to encode a polypeptide of 277 amino acids with 97% identity to mouse Nkx6-2. Northern blot experiments showed that NKX6B expression is tightly controlled in a tissue-specific fashion with the highest site of expression being the brain. Finally, using STS content mapping and RH analyis, we demonstrated that NKX6B maps to the 10q26, a region where frequent loss of heterozygosity has been observed in various malignant brain tumors. These results may implicate NKX6B as a candidate tumor suppressor gene for brain tumors, particularly for oligodendrogliomas.

These effects are mediated by two G-protein-coupled receptors and involve transcriptional regulation of growth-responsive and/or tissue-specific genes. We have used the cardiac ANF promoter, which represents the best-studied tissue-specific endothelin target, to elucidate the nuclear pathways responsible for the transcriptional effects of endothelins. We found that cardiac-specific response to endothelin 1 (ET-1) requires the combined action of the serum response factor (SRF) and the tissue-restricted GATA proteins which bind over their adjacent sites, within a 30-bp ET-1 response element. We show that SRF and GATA proteins form a novel ternary complex reminiscent of the well-characterized SRF-ternary complex factor interaction required for transcriptional induction of c-fos in response to growth factors. In transient cotransfections, GATA factors and SRF synergistically activate atrial natriuretic factor and other ET-1-inducible promoters that contain both GATA and SRF binding sites. Thus, GATA factors may represent a new class of tissue-specific SRF accessory factors that account for muscle- and other cell-specific SRF actions.

Advances in our understanding of axon regeneration have allowed the development of different experimental strategies to stimulate axon regeneration in animal models of spinal cord injury. Growth inhibitory proteins block axon regeneration in the CNS, and many of these proteins have been identified. Various methods that are now used to stimulate regeneration in the injured spinal cord are directed at overcoming the growth inhibitory environment of the CNS. Three general approaches tested in vivo stimulate regeneration in the spinal cord. First, antibodies that bind inhibitory proteins in myelin allow axon regeneration in the CNS. Second, methods that modulate neuronal intracellular signaling allow axons to grow directly on the inhibitory substrate of the CNS. Third, transplantation of cells to the lesioned spinal cord promotes repair. In this paper we review current advances in each of these research domains, (C) 2001 Academic Press.

ASIC1b and ASIC3 are highly expressed in primary sensory neurons and are thought to play a role in pain transmission related to acidosis. ASIC1a, ASIC2a, and ASIC2b are also distributed in the central nervous system where their function remains unclear. We investigated here the regulation of their expression during status epilepticus (SE), a condition in which neuronal overexcitation leads to acidosis. In animals treated with pilocarpine (380 mg/kg) to induce SE, we observed a marked decrease of ASlC2b mRNA levels in all hippocampal areas and of ASIC1a mRNA levels in the CA1-2 fields. These changes were also observed after protective treatment from neuronal cell death with diazepam (10 mg/kg) and pentobarbital (30 mg/kg). These findings suggest a key role of channels containing ASIC1a and ASIC2b subunits in both normal and pathological activity of hippocampus. (C) 2001 Academic Press.

In order to address this issue, microdialysate concentrations of serotonin, its precursor L-tryptophan and metabolite 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) as well as brain regional distribution of serotonin transporter ([(3H)]-citalopram) sites were measured in rats with acute liver failure resulting from hepatic devascularization. A significant loss of [H-3]-citalopram sites was observed in dorsal Raphe nucleus, in frontal and frontoparietal cortices as well as in substantia nigra of rats with severe encephalopathy resulting from acute liver failure. In frontal cortex, this loss of transporter binding sites was accompanied by significant increases of L-tryptophan, serotonin and 5-HIAA concentrations in extracellular fluid. Pharmacological manipulation of the brain serotonin system could afford a novel therapeutic approach to the prevention of the neuropsychiatric symptoms characteristic of acute liver failure in humans.

(1999) for measuring cortical thickness. This algorithm automatically determines the cortical thickness by 3-D extraction of the inner and outer surfaces of the cerebral cortex from an MRI scan. A manual method of tagging the grey-csf and grey-white interface was used on 20 regions (10 cortical areas found in each hemisphere) in 40 MRIs of the brain to validate the algorithm. The regions were chosen throughout the cortex to get broad assessment of the algorithm's performance. Accuracy was determined by an anatomist tagging the csf-grey and grey-white borders of selected gyri and by allowing the algorithm to determine the csf-grey and grey-white borders and the corresponding cortical thickness of the same region. Results from the manual and automatic methods were statistically compared using overall ANOVA and paired t tests for each region. The manual and automatic methods were in agreement for all but 4 of the 20 regions tested. The four regions where there were significant differences between the two methods were the insula left and right, the right cuneus, and the right parahippocampus. We conclude that the automatic algorithm is valid for most of the cortex and provides a viable alternative to manual methods of determining cortical thickness in vivo. However, caution should be taken when measuring the regions mentioned previously where the results of the algorithm can be biased by surrounding grey structures. (C) 2001 Academic Press.

Arginine vasopressin (AVP) also modulates HPA axis activity and may play a role in fear conditioning. Few human studies have examined interactions between CCK and AVP systems. To explore relationships between CCK-B receptor activation, the HPA axis response, and AVP release, a dose-response study using the CCK-B receptor agonist pentagastrin was conducted. Adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) and cortisol results have been previously reported and AVP data is presented here. Thirty-five healthy subjects were randomly assigned to receive placebo, or 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, or 0.8 mug/kg doses of pentagastrin. AVP release appeared to increase with increasing doses of the CCK-B agonist. However, this may have been due to a greater percentage of subjects releasing AVP in the higher dose groups, rather than a direct effect of dose on magnitude of response. AVP and ACTH responses were correlated, but AVP response alone could not account for the magnitude of the ACTH response. AVP release was significantly correlated with anxiety symptom responses. These findings suggest a possible role for the CCK-B receptor in AVP release which may be at least partially separate from its role in modulation of the HPA axis. Further work is needed to determine whether these are physiologically meaningful interactions and to determine their functional implications.

Since the recent hepatitis B vaccination program in France, there have been new reports of an increased risk of active multiple sclerosis after vaccination. Methods: We conducted a case-crossover study to assess whether vaccinations increase the risk of relapse in multiple sclerosis. The subjects were patients included in the European Database for Multiple Sclerosis who had a relapse between 1993 and 1997. The index relapse was the first relapse confirmed by a visit to a neurologist and preceded by a relapse-free period of at least 12 months. Information on vaccinations was obtained in a standardized telephone interview and confirmed by means of medical records. Exposure to vaccination in the two-month risk period immediately preceding the relapse was compared with that in the four previous two-month control periods for the calculation of relative risks, which were estimated with the use of conditional logistic regression. Results: Of 643 patients with relapses of multiple sclerosis, 15 percent reported having been vaccinated during the preceding 12 months. The reports of 94 percent of these vaccinations were confirmed. Of all the patients, 2.3 percent had been vaccinated during the preceding two-month risk period as compared with 2.8 to 4.0 percent who were vaccinated during one or more of the four control periods. The relative risk of relapse associated with exposure to any vaccination during the previous two months was 0.71 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.40 to 1.26). There was no increase in the specific risk of relapse associated with tetanus, hepatitis B, or influenza vaccination (range of relative risks, 0.22 to 1.08). Analyses based on risk periods of one and three months yielded similar results. Conclusions: Vaccination does not appear to increase the short-term risk of relapse in multiple sclerosis.

Dose-response analysis of nociception and neurological deficits	PAIN			English	Article						descending inhibitory controls; muscimol; bicuculline; formalin test; GABA; pain	NUCLEUS RAPHE MAGNUS; DORSAL HORN NEURONS; MORPHINE-INDUCED ANALGESIA; ANESTHETIZED RAT; FORMALIN TEST; REVERSIBLE INACTIVATION; DORSOLATERAL FUNICULUS; PHYSIOLOGICALLY INTACT; PERIAQUEDUCTAL GRAY; RETICULAR-FORMATION	We have examined the effects of muscimol and bicuculline microinjected in the rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM) on motor function and on nociception in three pain tests. In Exp. I microinjection of muscimol (6.25-400 ng in 1 mul) in the RVM dose-dependently decreased pain threshold of rats and the ED50 for muscimol was the same in both the hot plate and tail immersion pain tests. In the hot plate test, but not in the tail immersion test, paw withdrawal latencies increased again with high doses of muscimol (75-400 ng). High doses also produced catalepsy. Exp. 2 examined the effects of muscimol (50 ng) and bicuculline (50 ng) over a range of formalin concentrations (0.25-4%) in the formalin test. Muscimol increased responsiveness to formalin and reduced the slope of the formalin dose-response relation. Bicuculline decreased responses to formalin and reduced the slope of the formalin dose-response relation. It is suggested that RVM cells with inhibitory projections to the dorsal horn are not subject to strong GABAergic influence under mild noxious stimulation. RVM cells are thus active, and spinal dorsal horn relay neurons are inhibited. On the other hand, intense noxious peripheral stimulation may stimulate the release of GABA onto RVM cells, which in turn shuts off descending inhibitory fibers to allow transmission of nociceptor input through the dorsal hem.

The adaptation of motor behaviors requires the integration of sensory cues into the motor command. The respective roles of central neural networks and sensory feedback are presented in the order of increasing complexity. The simplest circuits described are those involved in the control of a single joint during posture (negative feedback-resistance reflex) and movement (modulation of sensory feedback and reversal of the reflex into an assistance rifler). More complex integration is required to solve problems of coordination of joint movements in a pluri-segmental appendage, and coordination of different limbs and different motor systems. In addition, beyond the question of mechanical fitting, the motor command must be appropriate to the behavioral context. Therefore, sensory information is used also to select adequate motor programs. A last aspect of adaptability concerns the possibility of neural networks to change their properties either temporarily (such on-line modulation exerted, for example, by presynaptic mechanisms) or more permanently (such as plastic changes that modify the synaptic efficacy). Finally, the question of how "automatic" local component networks are controlled by descending pathways, in order to achieve behaviors, is discussed. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Recently we have demonstrated that the oxidative insults in hippocampus from AD patients were dependent on the apoE genotype. Interestingly, apoE protein concentration in hippocampus follows a genotype-dependent gradient with the lowest level occurring in epsilon4 allele carrier. We raised the possibility that, in the hippocampus, the apoE level affects the oxidant/antioxidant balance. Here, we have examined in the apoE-deficient mouse the oxidant/antioxidant status in hippocampus and in frontal cortex from APOE-KO and wild-type mice at 3 and 13 months. We provided evidence that, in the hippocampus, the absence of apoE has a clear impact on the oxidant/antioxidant status. Endogenous level of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) was found to be markedly elevated whereas level of a-tocopherol was decreased in APOE-deficient mice at 3 and 13 months. Superoxide dismutase activities were also lower in APOE-deficient mice at 13 months. Taken together, these data indicate that the steady state level of apoE may influence, to a certain extent, the balance between oxidants and antioxidants in hippocampus.

Design: A longitudinal study of HIV-1-infected patients based on serial NP tests in a Paris University Hospital. Methods: A group of 91 HIV-1-infected patients, of whom 47 were already laking HAART at their first NP examination, were initially categorized as cognitively impaired (n = 53) or non-impaired (n = 38) and underwent one to six serial NP batteries (mean follow-up 12.3 +/- 8.3 months). Generalized estimating equations (CEE) were used ro evaluate performance in a given NP test according to the number of days on HAART. Results: Despite a 25% mortality rate among patients who had cognitive impairment at their first NP examination, GEE showed a positive relationship between the duration of HAART and cognitive performance. Performance in psychomotor tests (e.g. Purdue Pegboard dominant hand) improved continuously during the study period, while memory rest performance (e.g. Grober and Buschke free recall) tended to reach a plateau. Conclusions: HAART improves subcortical cognitive functions during the first year of treatment. Distinct neuropathological mechanisms appear to underlie psychomotor and memory dysfunctions in AIDS.

J	Guillemard, V; Saragovi, HU				Guillemard, V; Saragovi, HU			Taxane-antibody conjugates afford potent cytotoxicity, enhanced solubility, and tumor target selectivity	CANCER RESEARCH			English	Article							NERVE GROWTH-FACTOR; MONOCLONAL-ANTIBODY; IN-VIVO; RECEPTOR; TAXOL; CHEMOTHERAPY; CANCER; AGENTS; TRKA; P75	Paclitaxel (Taxol) is a chemotherapeutic agent that prevents disassembly of microtubular polymers, causing a growth arrest in the G(2)-M phase of the cell cycle and leading to apoptotic death. Paclitaxel has remarkable efficacy against fast-growing tumors but possesses major drawbacks, such as poor solubility and lack of tumor selectivity. Conversely, monoclonal antibodies usually have low therapeutic efficacy but are highly soluble and selectively target tumor markers overexpressed in cancer cells. Therefore, to improve the therapeutic index of taxanes as chemotherapeutics, the high toxicity of paclitaxel was combined with the high selectivity and solubility of monoclonal antibodies as targeting agents. We report the chemical coupling and characterization of paclitaxel-antibody conjugates for treatment of neuroectoderm-derived tumors. Paclitaxel-antibody conjugates afforded selective toxicity toward cells expressing the target marker and were more cytotoxic in vitro than equimolar concentrations of free paclitaxel or free paclitaxel plus free antibody. In an in vivo model of xenografted tumors, systemic administration of paclitaxel-antibody conjugates prevented tumor growth and prolonged survival of mice better than free drugs. In addition, paclitaxel-antibody conjugates were highly soluble in water and stable at -20 degreesC for at least 3 months. These studies mag lead to an increase or an improvement of the armamentarium and selectivity of cytotoxic agents.

The autosomal recessive form of juvenile amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS2) has previously been mapped to the 1.7-cM interval flanked by D2S116 and D2S2237 on human chromosome 2q33-q34. We identified three novel full-length transcripts encoded by three distinct genes (HGMW-approved symbols ALS2CR1, ALS2CR2, and ALS2CR3) within the ALS2 critical region. The intron-exon organizations of these genes as well as those of CFLAR, CASP10, and CASP8, which were previously mapped to this region, mere defined. These genes were evaluated for mutations in ALS2 patients, and no disease-associated sequence alterations in either exons or intron-exon boundaries were observed. Sequence analysis of overlapping RT-PCR products covering the whole coding sequence for each transcript revealed no aberrant mRNA sequences. These data strongly indicate that ALS2CR1, ALS2CK2, ALS2CR3, CFLAR, CASP10, and CASP8 are not causative genes for ALS2. (C) 2001 Academic Press.

The maintenance of synapse-specific facilitation in Aplysia sensory to motor neuron cultures can be blocked by inhibitors of translation and by the drug rapamycin, which specifically blocks a signaling pathway that regulates phosphorylation of translational regulators. One important target of rapamycin is the phosphorylation and subsequent activation of S6 kinase. To test whether S6 kinase is the target for the ability of rapamycin to block synapse-specific facilitation in Aplysia, we cloned Aplysia S6 kinase, its substrate S6, and the S6 kinase kinase phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK-1). Serotonin, which induces synapse-specific facilitation, increased phosphorylation of Aplysia S6 kinase at threonine 399 in a rapamycin-sensitive manner in Aplysia synaptosomes. The phosphorylation of threonine 399 by 5-HT was independent of phosphoinositide-3 kinase, dependent on PKA and PKC, and occluded by the phosphatase inhibitor calyculin-A. 5-HT also increased S6 kinase activity and led to increased phosphorylation of S6 in synaptosomes. 5-HT increased levels of S6 in synaptosomes because of a rapamycin-sensitive increase in translation-stabilization of S6. Aplysia PDK-1 bound to and phosphorylated Aplysia S6 kinase but only modulated phosphorylation of threonine 399 indirectly. These results suggest a mechanism by which the levels of translation factors can be increased specifically at activated synapses generating a longlasting synaptic tag.

The aim of this study was to elucidate the molecular mechanisms that regulate the transcription repression activity of Hes1, It is shown here that Heel associates with the nuclear matrix, the ribonucleoprotein network of the nucleus that plays important roles in transcriptional regulation. Nuclear matrix binding is mediated by the same Hes1 C-terminal domain that is also required for transcriptional repression. This domain contains the WRPW motif that acts as a binding site for the transcriptional corepressor Groucho, which also localizes to the nuclear matrix. Both the nuclear matrix association and transcription repression activity of Heel are inhibited by deletion of the WRPW motif, indicating that Groucho acts as a transcriptional corepressor for Hes1. This corepressor role is not modulated by the Groucho-related gene product Grg5, In contrast, the Bunt-related protein RUNX2, which localizes to the nuclear matrix and interacts with Groucho and Hes1, can inhibit both the Groucho(.)Hes1 interaction and the transcription repression ability of Hes1, Together, these observations suggest that transcriptional repression by Hes1 requires interactions with Groucho at the nuclear matrix and that RUNX proteins act as negative regulators of the repressive activity of Groucho(.)Hes1 complexes.

The main body of the fibril was identical with that of microfibrils and was made up of a core containing amyloid P component (AP), and a surface layer. beta amyloid protein (A beta) in the form of 1 nm wide flexible filaments was associated with the external surface of the microfibril. In cerebrovascular amyloid angiopathy the fibrils were formed at the outer surface of the vascular basement membrane. Overproduction of microfibrils has been reported at the basement membrane of "leaky" capillaries including the glomerular capillary in disease or leaky alveolar-capillary walls of normal lungs. Similarly, in Alzheimer's disease overproduction of microfibril-like beta amyloid fibrils in amyloid angiopathy coincided with breakdown of the blood-brain barrier of the cerebromicrovasculature. Thus, in the above three locations, the presence of abundant microfibrils, or microfibril-like structures, may be related to plasma which leaks out of the circulation into the adjoining vascular basement membrane. A-P is an essential constituent of microfibrils and since the only site where AP is available in the cerebral cortex is in leaky microvasculature, a chronic, steady supply of A-P into perivascular areas may be the cause of overproduction of microfibrils. Brain "microfibrils" may further be altered pathologically into beta amyloid fibrils by the addition of A beta. The origin of the fibrils in senile plaques may also be the microvasculature since in the area of the plaques no source of AP is apparent.

We study here a case where we know that the function to be learned is non-decreasing in two of its arguments and convex in one of them. For this purpose we propose a class of functions similar to multi-layer neural networks but (1) that has those properties, (2) is a universal approximator of continuous functions with these and other properties. We apply this new class of functions to the task of modeling the price of call options. Experiments show improvements on regressing the price of call options using the new types of function classes that incorporate the a priori constraints.

This is intrinsically difficult because of the curse of dimensionality: we propose to fight it with its own weapons. in the proposed approach one learns simultaneously (1) a distributed representation for each word (i.e. a similarity between words) along with (2) the probability function for word sequences, expressed with these representations. Generalization is obtained because a sequence of words that has never been seen before gets high probability if it is made of words that are similar to words forming an already seen sentence. We report on experiments using neural networks for the probability function, showing on two text corpora that the proposed approach very significantly improves on a state-of-the-art trigram model.

PNMT has been covalently immobilized onto a silica-based liquid chromatographic support, glutaraldehyde-P (Glut-P). The resulting PNMT-Glut-P stationary phase (PNMT-SP) was enzymatically active, stable, and reusable. Standard Michaelis-Menten kinetic studies were performed with both free and immobilized PNMT and known substrates and inhibitors were examined. The results demonstrate that the PNMT-SP can be utilized for the rapid screening of potential PNMT substrates as well as the screening of compounds for PNMT inhibitory activity.

After the induction of anesthesia in 15 patients undergoing gynecologic laparoscopic surgery, evoked EMG responses at the diaphragm were obtained by using skin electrodes at the back of the patient, placed lateral to T12/L1 or L1/L2, and a laparoscopically applied wire electrode inserted into the dorsolateral portion of the diaphragm. Acceleromyography at the right OO and the left CS was performed. The facial and phrenic nerves were stimulated transcutaneously (onset: every 10 s, offset: every 15 s, single twitch stimulation). Lag and onset time, peak effect, and clinical duration (time to reach 75% of control value and time to reach 90% of control value) were measured and the results were compared by using analysis of variance; P < 0.05 showed significant difference. Pearson's correlation test and the Bland-Altman test were used to compare the two diaphragmatic monitoring methods. Mean peak effects of >98% were reached at all sites. Onset times at diaphragm (skin, IM) were significantly (P < 0.005) shorter than at the CS or OO (100 +/- 14 s and 98 +/- 16 s vs 147 +/- 39 s, 185 +/- 38 s) without being statistically different between OO and CS. There was a good correlation of lag, onset time, time to reach 75% of control value, and time to reach 90% of control value (r = 0.8, 0.9, 0.8, and 0.75; P < 0.01) between the two diaphragmatic methods. Mean difference and limits of agreements are -2 +/- 15 s, 1 +/- 21 s, -1 +/- 2.3 min, and -2 +/- 3.4 min. We showed a shorter onset and clinical duration at the diaphragm in comparison with CS and OO. Two methods of EMG of the diaphragm correlated well and showed good comparability. The novel method of surface diaphragmatic EMG at the patient's back maybe useful during routine clinical anesthesia.

DATA SOURCES: A MEDLINE search (1988 to January 2000) was used to identify pertinent literature. Additional references were also retrieved from selected articles. STUDY SELECTION: As most published CHF studies were performed with candesartan and losartan, these agents are the main focus of this article. However, all identified comparative clinical studies were reviewed and included, regardless of the agent used. DATA SYNTHESIS: AgII receptor antagonists inhibit the effects of AgII at its sub-type 1 receptor, independently of AgII's synthesis pathway. They present a hemodynamic profile similar to that of ACE inhibitors, without reflex neurohormonal activation. They have been shown to be at least as effective as ACE inhibitors in improving symptoms, exercise capacity, and New York Heart Association functional class in CHF patients. Although the ELITE (Evaluation of Losartan in the Elderly) trial suggested that losartan improved survival compared with captopril, this study was not designed to look at mortality. ELITE-II, an adequately powered study, showed no difference in mortality rates between patients taking captopril and those taking losartan. The combination of AgII receptor antagonists and ACE inhibitors provides additional benefit on blood pressure lowering and prevention of ventricular remodeling. AgII receptor antagonists are well tolerated, with an incidence of adverse effects similar to or lower than that of ACE inhibitors. Their lack of effect on bradykinin degradation might explain their lower incidence of cough. CONCLUSIONS: The data cumulated thus far in patients with CHF highlight that ACE inhibitors must remain the treatment of choice and that AgII receptor antagonists may be considered as an acceptable alternative for patients who are intolerant to ACE inhibitors.

Summary Background Data Islet transplantation exposes the cells of the graft to a variety of stressful stimuli that could promote beta -cell death and lead to graft failure. Methods Islets from canine (n = 12) and cadaveric human (n = 6) pancreata were isolated and purified. Islets were cultured in CMRL 1066 with and without 100 ng/ml insulin. The response to cytokine stimulation with tumor necrosis factor (TNF)alpha and IL-1 beta and the p38 inhibitor PD169316 was also observed. islet lysates were analyzed by Western blotting for total and phosphorylated JNK and p38 content. Apoptosis was assessed by TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay and by a specific cell death enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA). Results In unstimulated islets, JNK activity was highest immediately following isolation, declining over 3 days to a low baseline level. The activity of p38 was lowest immediately after isolation, increasing progressively with time. The addition of insulin resulted in a more rapid decline in JNK activity, as opposed to p38, which showed no decrease in phosphorylation in response to insulin. In the cytokine stimulation studies, IL-1 beta stimulated p38 activation in a dose dependent manner, while JNK was relatively unaffected. PD169316 (100 mug/ml) was able to inhibit p38 activation in response to the isolation procedure as well as cytokine stimulation. Apoptotic activity was highest 24 hours after isolation, and was significantly reduced when islets were maintained in insulin-supplemented medium. Conclusions Inhibition of the stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK) pathways may be important for the maintenance of islet cell survival following islet isolation for transplantation. This study supports an autocrine role of insulin in this process.

Maternal care also influences the maternal behavior of female offspring, an effect that appears to be related to oxytocin receptor gene expression, and which forms the basis for the intergenerational transmission of individual differences in stress reactivity. Patterns of maternal care that increase stress reactivity in offspring are enhanced by stressors imposed on the mother. These findings provide evidence for the importance of parental care as a mediator of the effects of environmental adversity on neural development.

The argument that conversational relevance is a product of listener interpretation is supported in the present paper. Study 1 examines the topic-shifting profiles of a social worker in conversation with normal elderly participants as compared to her profiles in conversation with participants with dementia. Study 2 compares semantic segments in conversations between this same social worker and a normal adult and a traumatically brain-injured adult. Qualitative differences were found in Study 1 in the types of topic shifts used, the possible reasons for these shifts, and the context to which the shifts related. In Study 2, differences were found in the types of relationships between semantic segments and in the relative proportion of implicit and explicit segments. Support is given for considering conversational partners' roles in determining relevance.

Recently, a number of image compression algorithms using Neural Networks (NNs) have been developed. Particularly, several constructive feed-forward neural networks (FNNs) have been proposed by researchers for image compression, and promising results have been reported. At the previous SPIE AeroSense conference (2000), we proposed to use a constructive One-Hidden-Layer Feedforward Neural Network (OHL-FNN) for compressing still digital images. In this paper, we first investigate the generalization capability of the proposed OHL-FNN in the presence of additive noise for network training and/or generalization. Extensive experimental results for different scenarios are presented. It is revealed that the constructive OHL-FNN is not as robust to additive noise in input image as expected. Next, the constructive OHL-FNN is applied to moving images (video sequences). The first (or other specified) frame in a moving image sequence is used to train the network. The remaining moving images that follow are then generalized/compressed by this trained network. Three types of correlation-like criteria measuring the similarity of any two images are introduced. The relationship between the generalization capability of the constructed net and the similarity of images is investigated in some detail. It is shown that the constructive OHL-FNN is promising even for changing images such as those extracted from a "football game".

Background: Recent in a vivo imaging and in situ pathologic studies have demonstrated that substantial axonal damage accompanies the inflammatory lesions of MS. However, the relation of axonal damage to the duration of MS and its contribution to disability at different stages of the disease remain poorly defined. Design: We performed proton magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging in 88 patients with a wide range of clinical disability and disease duration to measure N-acetylaspartate: (NAA, an index of axonal integrity) relative to creatine (Cr) in a large central brain volume that included mostly normal-appearing white matter on magnetic resonance imaging. Results: We observed that the NAA/Cr values were abnormally low in the early stages of MS, even before significant disability (measured using the Expanded Disability Status Scale [EDSS]) was evident clinically, and declined more rapidly with respect to EDSS at lower than at higher EDSS scores (P<.001). The correlation of NAA/Cr values with EDSS score was significantly (P<.03) stronger in patients with mild disability (EDSS score <5, Spearman rank order correlation=-0.54, P<.001) than in patients with more severe disability (EDSS score greater than or equal to5, Spearman rank order correlation=-0.1, P<.9). When similar analyses were performed in patients with MS grouped for duration of disease, the subgroup with early disease duration (<5 years) also showed central brain NAA/Cr resonance intensity ratios significantly lower than healthy controls (P<.001). Conclusion: Cerebral axonal damage begins and contributes to disability from the earliest stages of the disease.

Design: The biomechanic variable COP-COM, which represents the distance between the COP and the COM, was determined from 2 AMTI force platforms and 3 OPTOTRAK(T) position sensors. Measurements were taken in quiet position, double leg stance, and eyes open and eyes closed conditions. Setting: Laboratory environment. Participants: Forty-five healthy subjects, 8 patients with diabetes neuropathy, and 7 stroke survivors, all of whom were at least 60 years old. Interventions: Subjects were evaluated on 2 separate occasions within 7 days by the same evaluator to determine test-retest reliability. Interrater reliability was determined the same day. Main Outcome Measures: The biomechanic variable COP-COM, which represents the distance between the COP and the COM in terms of root mean square. The mean of 4 trials of the COP-COM variable for each condition was used for statistical analysis. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were used. Results: The COP-COM variable has good reliability for both the test-retest and interrater studies, but its reliability varies according to the direction of the COP-COM. For the test-retest and interrater studies, the ICC ranged from .89 to .93 in the anteroposterior direction and from .74 to .79 in the mediolateral direction. Conclusion: The equivalence of the test-retest and interrater coefficients obtained suggests that the measurement error of the COP-COM variable is mainly linked to the biologic variability of this measure over a short period of time. Using the mean of 4 trials stabilizes the COP-COM variable enough to be potentially used to evaluate clinical change.

Finding support for the existence of such music-specific networks suggests that music may have biological roots. Conversely, the discovery that music may have systematic associations with other cognitive domains or variable brain organization across individuals supports the view that music is a cultural artifact. Currently, the evidence favors the biological perspective. There are numerous behavioral indications that music-specific networks are isolable in the brain. These neuropsychological observations are briefly reviewed here with special emphasis on a new condition, that of congenital amusia (also commonly referred to as tone deafness).

Studies using behavioral-lesion techniques as well as brain imaging methods demonstrate that tonal processing recruits mechanisms in areas of the right auditory cortex. Specifically, the right primary auditory area appears to be crucial for fine-grained representation of pitch information. Processing of pitch patterns, such as occurs in melodies, requires higher-order cortical areas, and interactions with the frontal cortex. The latter are likely related to tonal working memory functions that are necessary for the on-line maintenance and encoding of tonal patterns. One hypothesis that may explain why right-hemisphere auditory cortices seem to be so important to tonal processing is that left auditory regions are better suited for rapidly changing broad-band stimuli, such as speech, whereas the right auditory cortex may be specialized for slower narrow-band stimuli, such as tonal patterns. Evidence favoring this hypothesis was obtained in a functional imaging study in which spectral and temporal parameters were varied independently. The hypothesis also receives support from structural studies of the auditory cortex, which indicate that spectral and temporal processing may depend on interhemispheric differences in grey/white matter distribution and other anatomical features.

The mean (n = 4) total number of retinal ganglion cells (RGC) was estimated at 2,274,128 (s.d. = 273, 152). The ostrich retina exhibited a prominent horizontal visual streak along which a central area located nasal to the pecten had a peak density of 9,500 cells/mm(2). A high concentration of cells with a peak density of 2,646 cells/mm(2) was also observed in the temporal retina, slightly dorsal to the visual streak. The results further showed that the ostrich eye has a 15-mm pupil entrance diameter, its mean axial length is 39.81 mm, the estimated retinal magnification factor is 0.4075 mm/deg and the maximum visual acuity along the well-defined visual streak was estimated to be 19.32 cycles/deg. The latter component of the retina might subserve vision along the horizon while the temporal region mediates binocular processing. The data also showed that the degree of retinal illumination in this bird could be comparable to that noted in some nocturnal species. The findings in this study suggest that the ostrich might not be restricted to diurnal activity. Copyright (C) 2002 S. Karger AG, Basel.

Using 5-HT, sumatriptan and subtype selective 5-HT1 receptor agonists and/or the 5-HT1 receptor antagonist GR127935, we characterized the 5-HT receptors involved in regulating microvascular tone of pressurized intracortical arterioles (similar to 40-50 mum) isolated from human and bovine cerebral cortex. The role of nitric oxide (NO) on these responses was assessed with the N-omega-nitro-L-arginine (L-NNA, 10(-5) M), an inhibitor of NO synthesis. Bovine pial arteries were studied for comparative purposes. 2 At spontaneous tone, 5-HT induced a dose-dependent constriction of human and bovine microarteries (respective pot values of 7.3 +/- 0.2 and 6.9 +/- 0.1); a response potently inhibited by GR127935 (pIC(50) value of 8.5 +/- 0.1) in bovine microvessels. 3 In both species, the 5-HT1 receptor agonist sumatriptan induced a biphasic response consisting of a small but significant dilation at low concentrations (1 and/or 10 nM) followed by a constriction at higher doses (pD(2) for contraction of 6.9 +/- 0.1 and 6.6 +/- 0.2 in human and bovine vessels, respectively). Pre-incubation with L-NNA abolished the sumatriptan-induced dilation and significantly shifted the dose-response of the constriction curve to the left. In contrast, the selective 5-HT1D (PNU-109291) and 5-HT1F (LY344864) receptor agonists were devoid of any vasomotor effect. 4 In bovine pial vessels, 5-HT and sumatriptan elicited potent constrictions (respective pot of 7.2 +/- 0.1 and 6.6 +/- 0.1), a weak dilation being occasionally observed at low sumatriptan concentrations. 5 A significant negative correlation was observed between pial and intracortical vessels diameter and the extent of the dilatory response to 10(-9) M sumatriptan. Together, these results indicate that sumatriptan, most likely via activation of distinctly localized microvascular 5-HT1B receptors, can induce a constriction and/or a dilation which is sensitive to inhibition of NO synthesis and dependent on the size and, possibly, the existing tone of the vessels.

With the aim of assessing its therapeutic potential, we examined the effect of antisense oligonucleotide knockdown of spinal metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 (mGluR(1)) in neuropathic rats. 2 We chronically infused rats intrathecally with either vehicle, or 50 mug day(-1) antisense or missense oligonucleotides beginning either 3 days prior to or 5 days after nerve injury. Cold, heat and mechanical sensitivity was assessed prior to any treatment and again every few days after nerve injury. 3 Here we show that knockdown of mGluR(1) significantly reduces cold hyperalgesia, heat hyperalgesia and mechanical allodynia in the ipsilateral (injured) hindpaw of neuropathic rats. 4 Moreover, we show that morphine analgesia is reduced in neuropathic rats, but not in sham-operated rats, and that knockdown of mGluR(1) restores the analgesic efficacy of morphine. 5 We also show that neuropathic rats are more sensitive to the excitatory effects of intrathecally injected N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), and have elevated protein kinase C (PKC) activity in the spinal cord dorsal horn, two effects that are reversed by knockdown of mGluR(1). 6 These results suggest that activity at mGluR(1) contributes to neuropathic pain through interactions with, spinal NMDA receptors and PKC, and that knockdown of mGluR(1) may be a useful therapy for neuropathic pain in humans, both to alleviate pain directly, and as an adjunct to opioid analgesic treatment.

Main findings: NE may reduce the risk of thrombotic occlusion following lower extremity vascular reconstruction. This effect of NE may be attributed to reduced hypercoagulability, decreased peripheral resistance and increased graft flow. In patients under general anesthesia, only those authors using an aggressive perioperative management (pulmonary artery catheter monitoring, intensive care unit admission) were able to report grafts patency rates similar to those obtained with NE. NB facilitates the modulation of the hemodynamic and hormonal stress responses during the perioperative period. It also produces superior postoperative analgesia. Still, the impact of NE on cardiac morbidity following aortic reconstructive surgery remains open to debate. Only very few cases of epidural hematomas associated to NE following vascular surgery have been reported. They implicated patients who received either fibrinolytic medication, continuous heparin infusion, or both. Low molecular weight heparins may increase the risk or epidural hematoma and, should their administration become more frequent during vascular surgery, the safety of NE would then have to be reassessed. Conclusion: NE during vascular surgery is a safe and well-established practice. It offers many theoretical and demonstrated advantages. NE is particularly beneficial and economical for lower extremity vascular reconstrutcion. Still, NE may not be the best approach if the administration of fibrinolityc medication or prolonged heparin infusion is contemplated.

We evaluated the effects of sympathetic and parasympathetic activation on atrial flutter (AFl) by determining the effects of norepinephrine (NE) and acetylcholine (ACh) on the composition of the excitable gap. A model of reentry around the tricuspid valve was produced in 17 chloralose anesthetized dogs using a Y-shaped lesion in the intercaval area that extended to the right atrial appendage. Excitable gap characteristics were determined during AFl by scanning diastole with a single premature extrastimulus at progressively shorter coupling intervals to define the reset-response curve. Measurements were made during a constant infusion of NE (15 mug/min) into the right coronary artery and repeated during ACh infusion (2 mug/min) following a 15 min recovery period. The excitable gap (27 +/- 1 ms) was significantly (P < 0.001) increased by NE (34 +/- 1 ms) and ACh (50 +/- 2 ms). The fully excitable portion (7 +/- 1 ms) was also significantly (P < 0.001) increased by NE (17 +/- 1 ms) and ACh (43 +/- 2 ms). We conclude that both neurotransmitters increase the safety margin of full excitability ahead of the wavefront, demonstrating that parasympathetic and sympathetic activation can facilitate the persistence of this refractory atrial arrhythmia.

Multidrug resistance (MDR) is one of the main factors in the failure of chemotherapy against central nervous system tumors. The MDR1 gene encoding P-glycoprotein (P-gp), a drug efflux pump which plays a significant role in modulating MDR in a wide variety of human cancers, is highly expressed in the blood-brain barrier (BBB). The BBB controls central nervous system exposure to many endogenous and exogenous substances. The exact molecular mechanisms by which the BBB is involved in the resistance of brain tumors to chemotherapy remain to be identified. The purpose of this review is to summarize reports demonstrating that P-gp, one of the most phenotypically important markers of the BBB, is present in primary brain tumors and thus plays a crucial role in their clinical resistance to chemotherapy.

A previous study showed EEG slowing tie, a higher ratio of delta + theta frequencies to alpha + beta frequencies on EEG) during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and wakefulness in untreated OSAS patients. Study and objectives: To determine whether EEG slowing is reversible with continuous positive air pressure (CPAP) treatment and to verify whether the persistence of excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) is correlated with residual slowing of the EEG. Patients: Ten healthy subjects (9 men and 1 woman) and 14 patients with moderate-to-severe OSAS (13 men and 1 woman) were studied before and after 6 months of treatment with CPAP. Results: Untreated OSAS patients showed EEG slowing in frontal and central cortical regions during both wakefulness and during REM sleep compared to healthy control subjects. This EEG slowing was found to be independent of time spent with arterial oxygen saturation < 90%, severity of OSAS, or mean sleep latency as determined by the multiple sleep latency test. CPAP treatment was found to correct the EEG slowing for both REM sleep and wakefulness. Daytime sleepiness also greatly improved with treatment, but some degree of somnolence remained. Conclusion: CPAP treatment was found to correct the EEG slowing that was observed in untreated OSAS patients. Persistent EDS may be related to persistent obesity after CPAP treatment.

Thirty-five children received 146 courses of irinotecan administered as a 60-min i.v. infusion, daily for 5 days, every 21 days, after premedication with dexamethasone and ondansetron, Doses ranged from 30 mg/m(2) to 65 mg/m(2). An MTD was defined in heavily pretreated and less-heavily pretreated (i.e., two prior chemotherapy regimens, no prior bone marrow transplantation, and no radiation to the spine, skull, ribs, or pelvic bones) patients. Myelosuppression was the primary DLT in heavily pretreated patients, and diarrhea was the DLT in less-heavily pretreated patients. The MTD in the heavily pretreated patient group was 39 mg/m(2), and the MTD in the less-heavily pretreated patients was 50 mg/m(2). Non-dose-limiting diarrhea that was well controlled and of brief duration was observed in approximately 75% of patients. A partial response was observed in one patient with neuroblastoma, and in one patient with hepatocellular carcinoma. Stable disease (4-20 cycles) was observed in seven patients with a variety of malignancies including neuroblastoma, pineoblastoma, glioblastoma, brainstem glioma, osteosarcoma, hepatoblastoma, and a central nervous system rhabdoid tumor. In conclusion, the recommended Phase II dose of irinotecan administered as a 60-min i.v. infusion daily for 5 days, every 21 days, is 39 mg/m(2) in heavily treated and 50 mg/m(2) in less-heavily treated children with solid tumors.

Twenty patients who underwent limb-sparing procedures with complete resection of the sciatic nerve as treatment for neurofibrosarcomas (12 patients), liposarcomas (four patients), malignant fibrous histiocytomas (two patients), recurrent desmoid tumor (one patient), and epithelioid hemangioendothelioma (one patient) were reviewed retrospectively. The mean age of these nine women and 11 men at the time of surgery was 51 years (range, 28-84 years). The right sciatic nerve was affected in 12 patients. These tumors were large and high grade. A mean of 22 cm of the nerve had to be resected (range, 8-42 cm). Ten patients received preoperative radiotherapy and 16 patients had intraoperative or postoperative radiotherapy. At a mean followup of 35 months (range, 7-97 months), 14 of the 20 patients were alive. Two patients had local recurrences develop (10%), whereas 12 patients had distant metastases. The function of the 10 patients as assessed by the Toronto Extremity Salvage Score averaged 74%. Most patients indicated that walking in the house is not difficult, but walking is compromised as soon as an effort is needed. Four patients walk without a cane, four needed one cane, and two needed two canes. The patients experienced stiffness, a sense of numbness, and premature fatigue. The use of analgesics was infrequent. Generally, patients rated themselves to be mildly to moderately disabled. From this small number of patients, it is shown that a tumor involving the sciatic nerve can be treated by limb-sparing surgery, including complete nerve resection, as an alternative to hip disarticulation or hindquarter amputation because the limb salvage option provides an acceptable functional outcome.

Glutamate and glutamate receptors are located in areas of the brain, spinal cord and periphery that are involved in pain sensation and transmission. Glutamate acts at several types of receptors, including ionotropic (directly coupled to ion channels) and metabotropic (directly coupled to intracellular second messengers). Ionotropic receptors include those selectively activated by N-methyl-D-aspartate, alpha -amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid and kainate. Metabotropic glutamate receptors are classified into 3 groups based on sequence homology, signal transduction mechanisms and receptor pharmacology. Glutamate also interacts with the opioid system, and intrathecal or systemic coadministration of glutamate receptor antagonists with opioids may enhance analgesia while reducing the development of opioid tolerance and dependence. The actions of glutamate in the brain seem to be more complex. Activation of glutamate receptors in some brain areas seems to be pronociceptive (e.g. thalamus, trigeminal nucleus), although activation of glutamate receptors in other brain areas seems to be antinociceptive (e.g. periaqueductal grey, ventrolateral medulla). Application of glutamate, or agonists selective for one of the several types of glutamate receptor, to the spinal cord or periphery induces nociceptive behaviours. Inhibition of glutamate release, or of glutamate receptors, in the spinal cord or periphery attenuates both acute and chronic pain in animal models. Similar benefits have been seen in studies involving humans (both patients and volunteers); however, results have been inconsistent, More research is needed to clearly define the role of existing treatment options and explore the possibilities fur future drug development.

Psychophysical examination showed that for the paretic side she confused cool and warm temperatures, and confirmed that she had a robust allodynia to brush stroking that was enhanced at a cold ambient temperature. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) showed that during brush-evoked allodynia, brain structures implicated in normal pain processing (viz. posterior part of the interior cingulate cortex, secondary somatosensory cortex, and prefrontal cortices) were activated. The fMRI findings thus indicate that the central pain in this patient was served by brain structures implicated in normal pain processing.

The inheritance is autosomal recessive. Patients exhibit excessive urinary excretion of bound sialic acid and decreased or undetectable amounts of neuraminidase activity in various tissues. The clinical expression is variable, but ascites and hepatosplenomegaly are hallmarks of the disease. Skeletal abnormalities, facial dysmorphism and inguinal herniae have been described in most of the few reported cases. We describe a baby girl with biochemically proven sialidosis, who in addition to the above clinical features, had severely dilated coronary arteries, excessive retinal vascular tortuosity and an erythematous, macular rash. Homozygosity for a frameshift mutation at residue 623 of the neuraminidase cDNA was found. We speculate that the additional features found in our patient might be associated with the here described genotype of congenital sialidosis. Conclusion Severely dilated coronary arteries, excessive retinal vascular tortuosity and an erythematous macular rash might be associated features of congenital sialidosis.

Study Design and Methods: Urge incontinent patients qualified for surgical implantation of a neurostimulator system after trial screening with percutaneous test stimulation. Surgical implantation of the InteStim System (Medtronic Inc., Minneapolis, Minn., USA) was performed in cases where a >50% reduction in incontinence symptoms was documented during the 3- to 7-day test stimulation period. The InterStim System consists of an implantable pulse generator, a transforamenally placed quadripolar lead, and an extension that connects these two devices for unilateral stimulation of the S3 or S4 sacral nerve. Efficacy for 96 implanted patients was based on urinary symptom changes as quantified in voiding diaries collected at baseline and annually after surgical implantation. Results: As compared to baseline, the group of 96 implanted patients demonstrated significant reductions in urge incontinent symptoms at an average of 30.8 +/- 14.8 (range 12-60) months with respect to the number of urge incontinent episodes per day, severity of leaking, and the number of absorbent pads/diapers replaced per day due to incontinence (all p<0.0001, respectively). Gender, pretreatment variables, and age were not found to be relevant factors that affected these results. 11 of the 96 patients underwent device explant due to lack of efficacy, pain or bowel dysfunction. These data were conservatively included in the efficacy results. No permanent injuries associated with the devices or therapy were reported.

We present mapping and phenotypic characterization data for many of these genes and discuss their significance in understanding Fundamental developmental and cell biological processes. Our screen has identified genes that are involved in cell cycle control, intracellular transport, cell migration, maintenance of cell membranes, epithelial monolayer integrity and cell survival or apoptosis. We also describe new roles for the genes dunce [dnc), brainiac (brn) and fs(l)Yb, and we identify new alleles of Sex lethal (Sxi) ovarian tumor (otu) sons filles (snf) fs(l)KlO, singed (sn) and defective chorion-l [dec-l).
