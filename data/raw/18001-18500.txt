We have now defined Pitx1 promoter fragments that mimic the anterior but not posterior expression of Pitx1 in transgenic mice. In addition, we show positive regulation of this promoter in transfection studies by three members of the Pitx1 family (Pitx1, Pitx1b, Pitx2), as well as by a related factor, Otx1. Pitx1 autoregulation depends on DNA-binding and trans-activation domains of Pitx1 and it may be responsible for establishment and/or maintenance of the Pitx1 expression domain. Copyright (C) 2003 S.

Between 1997 and 1999, an inception cohort of 1,136 subjects entered into this longitudinal study. At the baseline assessment, 10.9% of the subjects were classified as 'not cognitively impaired' (NCO, 30.1% as 'cognitively impaired not demented' (CIND), and 59% as demented. A subclassification of CIND included amnestic 25.1%, vascular cognitive impairment 18.1%, psychiatric 17.2%, neurologic 7.3%, medical/toxic metabolic 3.5%, mixed 7.6% and not specified 19.0%. The percentage of the cohort referred with dementia increased progressively each decade, while the proportions of CIND and NCI decreased. Within the dementia group, Alzheimer's disease accounted for 47.2% of the subjects, mixed dementias 33.7%, vascular dementia 8.7%, frontotemporal degenerations 5.4%, dementia with Lewy bodies 2.5%, and unclassifiable 1.8%. The ACCORD cohort will allow a detailed study of the longitudinal course of CIND, and the longer-term outcomes of both treated and untreated dementia subjects. Copyright (C) 2003 S.

Available analgesics, such as morphine, either have minimal effects in neuropathic pain patients, or are not always well tolerated due to concurrent adverse effects. The chronicity of neuropathic pain is thought to be related to many neurochemical changes in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and spinal cord, including a reduction in the retrograde transport of nerve growth factor (NGF). In this study, we have determined the ability of chronic intrathecal (i.t.) infusion of NGF to reverse neuropathic pain symptoms and to restore morphine's effectiveness in an animal model of neuropathic pain. Seven days after sciatic nerve constriction injury, NGF was administered to the spinal cord by continuous infusion (125 ng/mul/h) via osmotic pumps attached to chronically implanted i.t. catheters. Spinal infusion of NGF did not affect the expression of tactile allodynia or thermal (hot) hyperalgesia in neuropathic rats, although it significantly increased cold water responses frequency at day 14. Following infusion of vehicle, i.t. morphine (20 mug) was ineffective in altering somatosensory thresholds in neuropathic rats. In contrast, morphine substantially attenuated the neuropathy-induced warm and cold hyperalgesia, as well as tactile allodynia, in neuropathic rats chronically infused with i.t. NGF. In addition, we demonstrate that i.t. morphine-induced antinociception was augmented by a cholecystokinin (CCK) antagonist in animals chronically infused with i.t. antibodies directed against NGF. We hypothesize that NGF is critical in maintaining neurochemical homeostasis in the spinal cord of nociceptive neurons, and that supplementation may be beneficial in restoring and/or maintaining opioid analgesia in chronic pain conditions resulting from traumatic nerve injury.

METHODS: We developed two sets of leave-one-out logistic regression models based on either 1) intratumoral H-1-MRSI features, including maximum values of a) choline and b) lactate-lipid, c) number of H-1-MRSI voxels with low N-acetyl group values, and d) number of H-1-MRSI voxels with high lactate-lipid values, all (a-d) of which were normalized to creatine in normal-appearing brain, or 2) standard clinicopathological features, including a) tumor histopathological grade, b) patient age, c) performance of surgical debulking, and d) tumor diagnosis (i.e., oligodendroglioma, astrocytoma). We assessed the accuracy of these two models in predicting patient survival for 6, 12, 24, and 48 months by performing receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. Cox proportional hazards analysis was performed to assess the extent to which patient survival could be explained by the above predictors. We then performed a series of leave-one-out linear multiple regression analyses to determine how well patient survival could be predicted in a continuous fashion. RESULTS: The results of using the models based on H-1-MRSI and clinicopathological features were equally good, accounting for 81, and 64% of the variability (r(2)) in patients' actual survival durations. All features except number of H-1-MRSI voxels with lactate-lipid/creatine values of at least 1 were significant predictors of survival in the (HMRSI)-H-1 model. Two features (tumor grade and debulking) were found to be significant predictors in the clinicopathological model. Survival as a continuous variable was predicted accurately on the basis of the H-1-MRSI data (r = 0.77, P < 0.001; median prediction error 1.7 mo). CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that appropriate analysis of H-1-MRSI data can predict survival in patients with supratentorial gliomas at least as accurately as data derived from more invasive clinicopathological features.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: SLDF perfusion measurements of the neuroretinal rim and the peripapillary retina were performed on 20 patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension (group G) and 20 normal volunteers (group N). Each subject underwent two independent sessions, 30 minutes apart, each involving 5 high quality images. Intrasession and intersession reproducibility coefficients for flow, volume, and velocity were calculated for a single image and for means of 3 and 5 images using analysis of variance models. RESULTS: Using a mean of 5 measurements for flow, the intrasession coefficient of reliability was 0.99 each for the rim, nasal retina, and temporal retina in group G and 0.93, 0.93, and 0.95, respectively, in group N. The intersession coefficient of reliability for flow was 0.99 for the rim, 0.95 for the nasal retina, and 0.87 for the temporal retina in group G and 0.87, 0.82, and 0.80, respectively, in group N. Compared with single image analysis, intrasession and intersession reproducibility were generally better when a mean of 3 images and substantially better when a mean of 5 images was used. CONCLUSION: SLDF full-field perfusion analysis is markedly more reproducible than the original software using 10 X 10 pixel windows. Obtaining mean values for at least 3 images improves the intrasession and intersession reproducibility of this technique.

A retrospective review of the medical records was conducted of all children younger than 17 years who presented with either the diagnosis of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis or multiple sclerosis between 1987 and 2001. Seventeen cases of clinically definite multiple sclerosis (seven female, mean age 12.4 +/- 4.5 years) and seven cases of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (three female; mean age 8.7 +/- 3.8 years) were reviewed. Systemic and nonfocal neurologic symptoms were more commonly evident in acute disseminated encephalomyelitis than in multiple sclerosis: fever (43% vs 6%), headache (57% vs 24 %), fatigue (71 % vs 29 %), vomiting (57 % vs 0 %), and encephalopathy (71 % vs 6 %). In multiple sclerosis patients, T-2-weighted white matter magnetic resonance imaging lesions were more commonly located in the corpus callosum (64 % vs 17 %) and the periventricular area (91% vs 50%) compared with those in patients with acute disseminated encephalomyelitis. These results suggest that acute disseminated encephalomyelitis and multiple sclerosis can be differentiated to some degree according to clinical and radiologic data at initial presentation, which is important because the long-term prognosis for childhood multiple sclerosis appears to be less favorable.

Here we employ a new approach of 'in vivo' Ca2+ imaging in this preparation. We demonstrate that bolus injection of membrane-permeable Ca2+ indicator dyes into the spinal cord of zebrafish larvae results in rapid staining of essentially the entire spinal cord. Using two-photon imaging, we could monitor Ca2+ signals simultaneously from a large population of spinal neurons with single-cell resolution. To test the method, Ca2+ transients were produced by iontophoretic application of glutamate and, as observed for the first time in a living preparation, of GABA or glycine. Glycine-evoked Ca2+ transients were blocked by the application of strychnine. Sensory stimuli that trigger escape reflexes in mobile zebrafish evoked Ca2+ transients in distinct neurons of the spinal network. Moreover, long-term recordings revealed spontaneous Ca2+ transients in individual spinal neurons. Frequently, this activity occurred synchronously among many neurons in the network. In conclusion, the new approach permits a reliable analysis with single-cell resolution of the functional organisation of developing neuronal networks.

A grammaticality judgment task was used, presented through a novel hidden-blocks design. Subjects listened to transformational and non-transformational sentences in which a host of other complexity generators (number of words, prepositions, embeddings, etc.) were kept constant. A series of analyses revealed that the neural processing of transformations is localizable, evoking a highly lateralized and localized activation in the left inferior frontal gyrus (Broca's region) and bilateral activation in the posterior superior temporal sulcus. The pattern of activation associated with transformational analysis was distinct from the one observed in neighboring regions, and anatomically separable from the effects of verb complexity, which yielded significant activation in the left posterior superior temporal sulcus. Taken together with neuropsychological evidence, these results uncover the neural reality of syntactic transformations.

First generation antipsychotics induce extrapyramidal motor symptoms (EPS), presumably through dopamine D-2 receptor blockade at the dorsal striatum. This may also produce impairment of cognitive processes, such as procedural learning, that are dependent on this region. Haloperidol and, to a lesser extent, risperidone, are active in the dorsal striatum and may induce EPS and impairment of procedural learning. In contrast, the prototypical second-generation antipsychotic, clozapine, is less active in the dorsal striatum and does not induce EPS or impair procedural learning. Olanzapine is pharmacologically similar to clozapine and has a low incidence of EPS induction. Objectives. To assess the hypothesis that olanzapine would not have a deleterious effect on procedural learning. Methods. Thirty-nine subjects with early phase schizophrenia were randomly assigned to double blind treatment with haloperidol, risperidone, or olanzapine. They were administered the Tower of Toronto test at an unmedicated baseline and again following 6 weeks and 6 months of treatment. Results. Procedural learning, defined as the improvement observed between two blocks of five trials of the Tower of Toronto, was preserved after 6 weeks of all three treatments but showed a substantial decline after 6 months of treatment with haloperidol or risperidone. Conclusions. These data are consistent with the differential activity of the three medications in dorsal striatum structures and suggest that the advantages of olanzapine over haloperidol and risperidone in relation to extrapyramidal syndromes may also generalize to procedural learning. The results also suggest that the procedural learning disadvantages of haloperidol and risperidone accrue slowly but are apparent after 6 months of treatment.

It is known that the processing of single words is the prerogative of the left hemisphere (LH), although the right hemisphere (RH) contributes with respect to specific variables (e.g., frequency, imageability). The goal of the present study was to investigate the contribution of both hemispheres to the semantic and phonological processing of single French words across two difficulty levels, using a divided visual field paradigm. Method. Twenty French-speaking female students (from 19 to 21 years old) participated in this study. They were university educated (from 14 to 15 years) and right-handed (more than 88% on the Edinburgh test). Single word phonological processing was measured by asking subjects to complete a grapheme-phoneme matching task where they had to decide if the presented word contained the target sound /o/ or not. Semantic processing was studied using a category judgement task, wherein the subjects had to indicate whether a given word belonged to the category of animals or not. The two levels of difficulty were determined by the degree of (1) transparency for the phonological task, and (2) target prototypicality for the semantic task. The words were projected in the right or left of the computer screen for 200 ms. Accuracy and response times were recorded. Results. Two 3-way ANOVAs were used to analyse results for both phonological and semantic processing of single words. For phonological processing, response patterns showed that both hemispheres carry out varying types of single word processing. The LH was found to be faster at stimulus processing and more sensitive to Transparency than the RH. In contrast, it appeared that the semantic processing of single words was similar across both hemispheres in the category judgement task with a Prototypicality effect on RTs. Discussion. Results showed an unexpected asymmetry between response patterns in the right and left visual hemifields but, for phonological processing only. As such, it seems that the neural networks involved in the phonological processing elicited by our grapheme-phoneme matching task are limited to the LH. For the semantic processing elicited by the category judgement task, the neurobiological substrate appears to be evenly distributed across both the LH and the RH.

Technical note, case report. and review of literature. Objective. Description of anterior transarticular internal fixation for traumatic C1-C2 instability. Summary of Background Data. The currently effective posterior approaches for instrumentation of the C1-C2 junction require considerable soft tissue dissection and prone patient positioning. Some medical and anatomic conditions restrict the posterior approach. Materials and Methods. An odontoid screw and anterior transarticular C1-C2 screws were used to instrument an unstable injury at this junction. The lesion consisted of a type II dens fracture and C1 ring disruption. Two high-quality fluoroscopy machines, a radiolucent OSI fracture table, and the Synframe (Synthes, Paoli, PA) retraction system are used for this procedure. The implant of choice is the 4.0-mm cannulated titanium screw. Results. At 4-month follow-up, successful stabilization without failure of hardware is documented. The patient's neurologic status is stable, with a minor residual left upper extremity motor deficit. The patient has restricted C-spine rotation but no neck pain with movement. Conclusion. Anterior stabilization through a standard Smith-Robinson approach of the C1-C2 junction with screws into the odontoid and the lateral masses of C1 is effective. Supine positioning and minimal soft tissue dissection are advantages of this method over standard posterior transarticular instrumentation. Knowledge of the local anatomy, strict adherence to the operative protocol, and high-quality fluoroscopy avoid potential surgical complications.

It can reveal dense retinofugal projections to well-known retinorecipient nuclei along with sparse but distinct input to target areas that are not commonly recognized. Following a unilateral injection of CTb into the vitreous chamber of seven adult cats, we localized the toxin immunohistochemically in order to identify direct retinal projections in these animals. Consistent with previous findings, the strongest projections were observed in the superficial layers of the superior colliculus, the dorsal and ventral lateral geniculate nuclei, the pretectal nuclei, the accessory optic nuclei, and the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus. However, we also found labelled terminals in several other brain areas, including the zona incerta, the medial geniculate nucleus, the lateral posterior-pulvinar complex, the lateral habenular nucleus, and the anterior and lateral hypothalamic regions. The morphological characteristics of the retinal axon terminals in most of the identified novel target sites are described.

The biochemical signals following engagement of either Trk or p75 with ligands are well understood, but long-term biological outcomes (trophic, proapoptotic or differentiative) remain unclear because they are cell/tissue specific. For example, Trk receptors are usually trophic but when overexpressed they can be proapoptotic in neuroblastomas and medulloblastomas. We hypothesized that coexpression of Trk and p75 receptors may lead to cross-regulation of signals and different biological outcomes; and used receptor-selective ligands to study cross-regulation by these receptors. We show that in the absence of Trk activation, expression of TrkC is permissive of p75 trophic and differentiation signals induced by p75 ligands, whereas expression of TrkA abolishes trophic and differentiation signals induced by p75 ligands. In contrast, in the presence of Trk activation, p75 ligands can regulate TrkA-mediated survival and TrkC-mediated differentiation. Therefore, a complex homeostasis of p75-selective and Trk-selective signals may determine the fate of cells expressing both receptors.

Leukocytes migrate to inflammatory sites in response to chemokines. We studied leukocyte migration and glial chemokine expression within the denervated hippocampus in response to axonal injury caused by entorhinodentate lesions. A population of Mac1/CD11b+ CD45(high) macrophages ( distinct from CD45(low) microglia) was specifically detected within the lesion-reactive hippocampus by 12 hr after injury. Significant infiltration by CD3 + T cells did not occur in the denervated hippocampus until 24 hr after axotomy. A broad spectrum of chemokines [RANTES/CCL5, monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1/CCL2, interferon gamma inducible protein (IP)-10/CXCL10, macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1alpha/CCL3, MIP-1beta/CCL4, and MIP-2/CXCL2] was induced at this time. RANTES/CCL5 was not significantly elevated until 24 hr after axotomy, whereas MCP-1/CCL2 was significantly induced before leukocyte infiltration occurred. Neither T cells nor macrophages infiltrated the denervated hippocampus of CCR2-deficient mice, arguing for a critical role for the CCR2 ligand MCP-1/CCL2 in leukocyte migration. Both T cells and macrophages infiltrated CCR5-deficient hippocampi, showing that CCR5 ligands ( including RANTES/CCL5) are not critical to this response. In situ hybridization combined with immunohistochemistry for ionized binding calcium adapter molecule (iba)1 or glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) identified iba1 + microglia and GFAP + astrocytes as major sources of MCP-1/CCL2 within the lesion-reactive hippocampus. We conclude that leukocyte responses to CNS axonal injury are directed via innate glial production of chemokines.

The brain region most affected by aging in these mice is the hippocampus. Choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) enzymatic activity and synapsin immunoreactivity are reduced at 20 months of age. Neurons in the dentate gyrus show signs of progressive degenerative changes, hypertrophy and glyosis, and subsequent cell shrinkage and death. These results suggest that the menopausal mouse mimics degenerative changes in the hippocampus of hormonally imbalanced aging humans. We propose using this animal model to test the effectiveness of potential therapeutics in paradigms of accelerated aging.

However, the nature of the mechanisms that underlie such disinhibition has remained controversial(3-6). Here we present evidence for a novel mechanism of disinhibition following peripheral nerve injury. It involves a trans-synaptic reduction in the expression of the potassium-chloride exporter KCC2, and the consequent disruption of anion homeostasis in neurons of lamina I of the superficial dorsal horn, one of the main spinal nociceptive output pathways(7). In our experiments, the resulting shift in the transmembrane anion gradient caused normally inhibitory anionic synaptic currents to be excitatory, substantially driving up the net excitability of lamina I neurons. Local blockade or knock-down of the spinal KCC2 exporter in intact rats markedly reduced the nociceptive threshold, confirming that the reported disruption of anion homeostasis in lamina I neurons was sufficient to cause neuropathic pain.

Here, we show that Semaphorin 3F (Sema 3F) can antagonize nerve growth factor (NGF)-stimulated TrkA (tyrosine receptor kinase A) signaling in sympathetic neurons, thereby apparently contributing to growth cone collapse. Sema 3F suppressed NGF-induced activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3 (PI3)-kinase-Akt and MEK (mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase)-ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase) pathways, both of which we show to be required to maintain growth cone structure. Sema 3F-induced growth cone collapse was partially reversed by sustained activation of the PI3-kinase and MEK pathways, which was achieved by overexpression of the Gab-1 (growth-associated binder 1) docking protein. These data indicate that a novel mechanism used by Sema 3F to collapse growth cones in sympathetic neurons is to dampen neurotrophin signaling, providing an intracellular mechanism for cross talk between positive and negative axon growth cues.

This study aims at designing small cyclic peptides that would specifically inhibit two members of this family of enzymes, namely, the neuroendocrine PC1/3 and the ubiquitously expressed furin. We studied peptide sequences related to the 18-residue loop identified as the active site of the 83 amino acid barley serine protease inhibitor 2 (BSPI-2). Peptides incorporating mutations at various positions in the sequence were synthesized on solid phase and purified by HPLC. Cyclization was achieved by the introduction of a disulfide bridge between the two Cys residues located at both the N- and C-terminal extremities. Peptides VIIA and VIIB; incorporating P4Arg, P2Lys, P1Arg, and P2'Lys were the most potent inhibitors with K-i around 4 muM for furin and around 0.5 muM for PC1/3. Whereas peptide VIIB behaved as a competitive inhibitor of furin, peptide VIIA acted as a noncompetitive one. However, all peptides were eventually cleaved after variable incubation times by PC1/3 or furin. To avoid this problem, we incorporated at the identified cleavage site a nonscissile aminomethylene bond (psi)[CH2-NH]). Those pseudopeptides, in particular peptide VIID, were shown not to be cleaved and to inhibit potently furin. Conversely, they were not able to inhibit PC1/3 at all. Those results show the validity of this approach in designing new effective PC inhibitors showing a certain level of discrimination between PC1/3 and furin.

Instillation of either capsaicin or mustard oil induced a significant activation of lumbosacral spinal ERK1/2, measured by immamoblot, with a peak 2.4-fold increase over control levels between 45 and 90 min post-treatment. Intracolonic saline did not produce significant activation of lumbosacral spinal ERK1/2, and none of the treatments evoked ERK1/2 activation in thoracic or cervical spinal cord. These studies suggested a preferential nuclear localization, which was explored by subcellular fractionation. Both mustard oil and capsaicin produced a redistribution of phosphorylated ERK1/2 from cytosol into the nucleus that was statistically significant at 45 min after treatment. Spinal ERK1/2 activation with capsaicin treatment correlated with the development of prolonged referred hyperalgesia. The upstream inhibitor of ERK phosphorylation, U0126 (100-400 mug/kg, i.v., 10 min pre-capsaicin), dose-dependently inhibited referred hyperalgesia 3-6 h after capsaicin. Treatment with U0126 did not affect spontaneous pain behavior or colon inflammation. Our data show that ERK activation plays a specific role in maintaining prolonged referred (secondary) hyperalgesia in visceral pain.

Here we compared children who had hypoxic-ischemic events before 1 year of age (early group, n = 6) with others who showed memory problems after suffering hypoxic-ischemic events between the ages of 6 and 14 years (late group, n = 5). Morphometric analyses of the whole brain revealed that, compared with age-matched controls, both groups had bilateral abnormalities in the hippocampus, putamen, and posterior thalamus, as well as in the right retrosplenial cortex. The two groups also showed similar reductions (approximate to40%) in hippocampal volumes. Neuropsychologically, the only significant differences between the two were on a few tests of immediate memory, where the early group surpassed the late group. The latter measures provided the only clear indication that very early injury can lead to greater functional sparing than injury acquired later in childhood, due perhaps to the greater plasticity of the infant brain. On measures of long-term memory, by contrast, the two groups had highly similar profiles, both showing roughly equivalent preservation of semantic memory combined with marked impairment in episodic memory. It thus appears that, if this selective memory disorder is a special syndrome related to the early occurrence of hypoxia-induced damage, then the effective age at injury for this syndrome extends from birth to puberty.

This is intrinsically difficult because of the curse of dimensionality: a word sequence on which the model will be tested is likely to be different from all the word sequences seen during training. Traditional but very successful approaches based on n-grams obtain generalization by concatenating very short overlapping sequences seen in the training set. We propose to fight the curse of dimensionality by learning a distributed representation for words which allows each training sentence to inform the model about an exponential number of semantically neighboring sentences. The model learns simultaneously (1) a distributed representation for each word along with (2) the probability function for word sequences, expressed in terms of these representations. Generalization is obtained because a sequence of words that has never been seen before gets high probability if it is made of words that are similar (in the sense of having a nearby representation) to words forming an already seen sentence. Training such large models (with millions of parameters) within a reasonable time is itself a significant challenge. We report on experiments using neural networks for the probability function, showing on two text corpora that the proposed approach significantly improves on state-of-the-art n-gram models, and that the proposed approach allows to take advantage of longer contexts.

The results showed that inhibition of growth and/or induction of apoptosis can be achieved by these molecules in human glioblastoma cells. Inhibition of DNA synthesis precedes induction of apoptosis and growth inhibition. The substituents at C-1, C-2, C-3,C-4, and C-6 on the pyranosidic scaffold are important to modulate the action and the efficacy of these molecules. Human fibroblasts and brain-derived endothelial cells were less sensitive to glycomers than tumor cells. Thus, functionalized aryl beta-D-glycopyranosides represent a new class of molecules potentially able to control the progression of brain tumors.

In contrast, primary human neurons in culture are resistant to extracellular Abeta-mediated toxicity. Here, we investigate the involvement of p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75(NTR)) in Abeta-treated human neurons. We find that Abeta(1-40) and Abeta(1-42), but not the reverse control peptide, Abeta(40-1), rapidly increase the levels of p75(NTR) in a specific and dose-dependent manner. In contrast to observations in cell lines, enhanced expression of p75(NTR) in human neurons via a herpes simplex virus amplicon vector does not increase the susceptibility of neurons to Abeta. Unexpectedly, inhibition of p75(NTR) expression with an antisense expression construct or incubation of the cells with an antibody to the extracellular domain of p75(NTR) sensitizes human neurons to extracellular nonfibrillar or fibrillar Abeta(1-42) cytotoxicity. Unlike intracellular Abeta, extracellular Abeta toxicity is independent of p53 and Bax activity. However, Abeta toxicity is inhibited by caspase inhibitors and the glycogen synthase kinase 3beta inhibitor lithium. Neuroprotection against Abeta is phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase dependent but Akt independent. These results are consistent with a neuroprotective role for p75(NTR) against extracellular Abeta toxicity in human neurons.

Brain tissue histamine and telemethylhistamine levels, as well as plasma histamine concentration were assayed. Binding properties and regional distribution of the autoregulatory histamine H-3 receptors in brain were studied with [H-3]-R-alpha-methylhistamine receptor binding and autoradiography. In L-histidine loaded rats, tissue histamine levels in cortex, hypothalamus, and rest of the brain were significantly increased by 40%-70%. Histamine concentrations in cerebellum and plasma, and tele-methylhistamine concentrations in cortex and hypothalamus did not change. The binding properties of H-3 receptors in cortex were not altered. However, there were changes in the regional distribution of [H-3]-R-alpha-methylhistamine binding sites, suggestive of a region-selective up-/down-regulation of histamine H-3 receptors or their receptor sub-types. These results imply that following repeated L-histidine administration in the rat (1) there is enhanced synthesis of brain histamine not reflected in its functional release; (2) the excess of histamine is sequestered and stored rather than being metabolized; (3) histamine H-3 receptor binding properties are not altered, whereas receptor density is;changed in selected regions. In conclusion, these results demonstrate that the neuronal mechanisms controlling histamine synthesis, storage, and-release are adaptable and allow the sequestration of the excess of histamine in order to prevent excessively high neuronal activity.

The theory relies on a model of a synergy made up of two neuromuscular systems, one agonist and the other antagonist to the movement. Representing these systems with lognormal impulse responses, it is predicted that the velocity profile of a fast movement will be described by a delta-lognormal equation. So far, many studies have been conducted to test and empirically validate the theory. This paper presents an extended mathematical proof of the model. The proof is based on the Central Limit Theorem under the assumption that a law of proportionate effect governs the cumulative time delays of a sequence of dependent subprocesses constituting a neuromuscular system. Furthermore, a detailed interpretation of the parameters of the delta-lognormal equation, in terms of movement time and amplitude, response time and time delays, is discussed, providing new insights into the properties of the model with respect to neuromuscular system activity and movement generation.

In contrast, the relationship between the processing of music and prosodic speech information (e.g., intonation) has been largely ignored. We report an assessment of prosodic perception for an amateur musician, KB, who became amusic following a right-hemisphere stroke. Relative to matched controls, KB's segmental speech perception was preserved. However, KB was unable to discriminate pitch or rhythm patterns in linguistic or musical stimuli. He was also impaired on prosodic perception tasks (e.g., discriminating statements from questions). Results are discussed in terms of common neural mechanisms that may underlie the processing of some aspects of both music and speech prosody. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The increased resistance is thought to serve as a compensatory mechanism to help maintain perfusion to the vital organs by sustaining blood pressure in the fate of a failing heart. Local mechanisms, and in particular endothelial dysfunction, have also been shown to be important contributors in regulating arterial resistance and vascular remodeling in this disease. In this issue of the British Journal of Pharmacology, Gschwend et al. (2003) present new data suggesting that in the absence of a functional endothelium, myogenic constriction of small pressurized mesenteric arteries, an intrinsic property of vascular smooth muscle cells, is enhanced in a coronary artery ligation-induced myocardial infarction model of congestive heart failure (CHF) in the rat. The increased myogenic tone appears to be tightly linked to angiotensin II type 1 receptors (AT(1)). The possibility that CHF-induced stimulation of myogenic constriction is due to the local release of preformed angiotensin II or constitutive upregulation of the AT(1) receptor signaling pathways are discussed along with other potential cellular and molecular mechanisms previously suggested to play a role in myogenic reactivity.

We report its organization and the impact of diagnostic criteria on the study of VCI. Methods: Nine memory disability clinics enrolled patients and recorded their usual investigations and care. A case report form included all vascular dementia (VaD) individual criteria for each of four sets (National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS-AIREN), Alzheimer's Disease Diagnostic Treatment Centers (ADDTC), the ICD-10 Classification of Mental and Behavioural Disorders (ICD-10), and the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV)) of consensus-based diagnostic criteria and for the Hachinski Ischemia Score (HIS). Investigators, having completed the case report form. were asked to make a clinical judgement about the cognitive diagnosis based on the best available information, including neuroimaging. Results: Of 1,347 patients (mean age 72 years; 56% women), 846 (63%) were diagnosed with dementia and 324 (24%) were diagnosed with VCI. The proportion of patients diagnosed with VaD by the diagnostic criteria was: 23.9% (n=322) by DSM-IV, 10.2% (n=137) by HIS, 4.3% (n=58) by ICD-10, 3.8% (n=51) by ADTCC, and 3.6% (n=48) by NINDS-AIREN. Judged against a clinical diagnosis of VaD, the sensitivity/specificity of each was: DSM-IV (0.77/0.80); HIS (0.41/0.92); ICD-10 (0.29/0.98); ADTCC (0.24/0.98): NINDS-AIREN (0.42/0.995). Compared with a clinical diagnosis of VCI, sensitivities were lower for the diagnostic criteria, reflecting the exclusion of patients who did not have dementia. Conclusions: Consensus-based criteria for VaD omit patients who do not meet dementia criteria that are modeled on Alzheimer's disease. Even for patients who do, the proportion identified with VaD varies widely. Criteria based on empirical analyses need to be developed and validated.

The autosomal dominant form of this disease is caused by short expansions of a (GCG)(6) repeat to (GCG)(8-13) in the PABPN1 gene. The mutations lead to the expansion of a polyalanine stretch from 10 to 12-17 alanines in the N-terminus of PABPN1. The mutated PABPN1 (mPABPN1) induces the formation of intranuclear filamentous inclusions that sequester poly(A) RNA and are associated with cell death. Methods: Human fetal brain cDNA library was used to look for PABPN1 binding proteins using yeast two-hybrid screen. The protein interaction was confirmed by GST pull-down and co-immunoprecipitation assays. Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy cellular model and OPMD patient muscle tissue were used to check whether the PABPN1 binding proteins were involved in the formation of OPMD intranuclear inclusions. Results: We identify two PABPN1 interacting proteins, hnRNPA1 and hnRNPA/B. When co-expressed with mPABPN1 in COS-7 cells, predominantly nuclear protein hnRNPA1 and A/B colocalize with mPABPN1 in the insoluble intranuclear aggregates. Patient studies showed that hnRNP A1 is sequestered in OPMD nuclear inclusions. Conclusions: The hnRNP proteins are involved in mRNA processing and mRNA nucleocytoplasmic export, sequestering of hnRNPs in OPMD intranuclear aggregates supports the view that OPMD intranuclear inclusions are "poly(A) RNA traps", which would interfere with RNA export, and cause muscle cell death.

Yet, the availability and efficient utilization of residential resources partly determines the capacity of a comprehensive system of care to avoid clogging ever-shrinking acute care bed facilities. Objectives: To describe the actual utilization of and projected needs for residential resources, one part of tertiary care, in the catchment area of a psychiatric hospital in east-end Montreal. To compare results obtained against actual utilization and projected needs evaluated in other Canadian provinces and in other countries, with a view to establishing national benchmarks, Methods: Two surveys were undertaken to establish the number of places in these facilities that were utilized and needed for adults aged 18 to 65 years with severe mental disorders, without a primary diagnosis of mental retardation or organic brain syndrome, and originally from the catchment area. A first survey ascertained the number of places utilized and of those needed for residential care among all long-stay inpatients and all adults in supervised residential facilities. A second survey identified the need for such long-stay hospitalization, nursing homes, and supervised facilities as an alternative or as a complement to hospitalization among acute care inpatients. Results: The actual ratio of places in long-stay hospital units, nursing homes, and supervised residential facilities was 150:100 000 inhabitants. The ideal ratio, according to estimated needs, is 171:100 000. The figure breakdown is as follows: 20:100 000 for long-stay hospital units, 20:100 000 for nursing homes, 40:100 000 for group homes, 40:100 000 for private hostels or foster families, and 51:100 000 for supervised apartments. The needs of this urban, blue-collar population for supervised residential places hovered in the upper range of utilization and standards for European countries and within the proposed standards for Canadian provinces. Discussion: Needs for long-stay hospitalization or for supervised residential facilities cannot be treated as absolute. For example, evaluation conducted in this hospital-led system of psychiatric care may produce higher estimates of institutional care. Comparing actual utilization and projected needs in this urban catchment area with current utilization in other jurisdictions in Canada and Europe should contribute to establishing sound national benchmarks within ranges. Conclusions: It is possible to establish benchmarks that guide the development of supervised residential settings to best meet the needs of the population of adults with severe and persistent mental disorders. The methods used here to assess needs should serve as guidelines for future research, because they were designed to contain the bias of over- or underprovision of care in the current utilization.

To address this issue, we have analyzed how Hoxa2 specifies segmental identity in the second branchial arch. Using a subtraction approach, we found that Ptx1 was upregulated in the second arch mesenchyme of Hoxa2 mutants. This upregulation has functional significance because, in Hoxa2(-1-);Ptx.1(-1-) embryos, the Hoxa2(-1-) phenotype is partially reversed. Hoxa2 interferes with the Ptx1 activating process, which is dependent on Fgf signals from the epithelium. Consistently, Lhx6, another target of Fgf8 signaling, is also upregulated in the Hoxa2(-1-) second arch mesenchyme. Our findings have important implications for the understanding of developmental processes in the branchial area and suggest a novel mechanism for mesenchymal patterning by Hox genes that acts to define the competence of mesenchymal cells to respond to skeletogenic signals.

Little is known, however, of the range of developmental processes in which it is involved. We used in situ hybridization to investigate progranulin expression in murine embryos. Progranulin mRNA is expressed in maternal and embryonic components during early establishment of pregnancy. Abundant expression is observed in the early decidualizing uterine stroma and glands. In the embryo, the trophoblast giant cells at the interface of placental exchange sites (both choriovitelline and chorioallantoic placenta) show strong expression. The gastrulating epiblast and mesenchyme (intraembryonic and extraembryonic mesenchyme) all revealed activity. The allantois and yolk sac mesenchyme (site of early hemopoiesis) were positive, as were later phases of active vessel formation (pia mater of brain, epicardium of the heart). In the urogenital system, it was expressed in Sertoli cells and in kidney tubules. It was highly expressed in proliferating epidermal cells. During epidermal appendage formation, the early epithelial bud was positive, but the forming duct and differentiating adjacent mesenchyme was negative. It is widely distributed during central nervous system development and the peripheral nervous system (dorsal root ganglia and sympathetic ganglia). Based on the pattern of progranulin gene expression, we propose proliferative and developmental roles for progranulin in establishing pregnancy, during gastrulation, and during embryonic development of the epidermis, nervous system, blood vessel, formation, and spermatogenesis.

This is achieved by the integration of excitatory, inhibitory, and sensory nerve activity in control centers in the spinal cord, pons, and forebrain. It is possible that much of bladder pathology is related to disturbances in the vesical ganglia, sensory reflex loops, and central control of micturition. Experimental studies in animals have revealed that spinal reflex circuits involved in voiding function exhibit a dense serotonergic innervation, multiple 5-HT receptors, and sensitivity to 5-HT receptor agonists and antagonists, and 5-HT reuptake inhibitors. Activity in the serotonergic pathway generally enhances urine storage by facilitating the vesical sympathetic reflex pathway and inhibiting the parasympathetic voiding pathway. Thus, 5-HT receptor antagonists and reuptake inhibitors represent important targets for the development of new treatments of detrusor overactivity and urinary incontinence. Among the drugs modulating the bladder function through 5-HT receptor, duloxetine, a potent and selective inhibitor of 5-HT and NE reuptake, is presently undergoing clinical trials for stress urinary incontinence after being shown to be effective in animal models of this condition.

Whereas no desensitization was observed in HEK293 cells heterologously expressing the receptor, GABA and the synthetic agonist baclofen induced a robust desensitization in cerebellar granule cells endogenously expressing the receptor. Taking advantage of this cell-specific desensitization phenotype, we identified GRK4 as the kinase involved in the neuronal desensitization. Transfection of small interference RNA directed against GRK4 significantly reduced GRK4 levels in cerebellar granule cells and strongly inhibited the agonist-promoted desensitization. Reciprocally, transfection of GRK4 in HEK293 cells restored agonist-promoted desensitization, confirming that this kinase is sufficient to support desensitization. Surprisingly, this desensitization occurred in the absence of ligand-induced receptor phosphorylation and could be promoted by GRK4 mutants deleted of their kinase domain. Taken together, these results suggest that GRK4 plays a central role in the agonist-promoted desensitization of GABA(B) receptor and that it does so through an atypical mechanism that challenges the generally accepted model linking the kinase activity of GRKs to their role in receptor desensitization.

The purpose of this study was to examine the specificity of EC atrophy in epilepsy. Methods: We performed volumetric measurement of the EC on high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in patients with TLE (n = 70), extratemporal lobe epilepsy (ETE; n = 18), and idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE; n = 20). EC volumes of epilepsy patients were compared with those of 48 age- and sex-matched normal controls. Within the TLE group, 63 patients were selected prospectively with hippocampal atrophy ipsilateral to the seizure focus. The remaining seven patients were chosen retrospectively based on normal volumetric MRI of the hippocampus and amygdale, as well as normal histopathologic examination of the resected tissue. Results: Compared with normal controls, EC volume was smaller ipsilateral but not contralateral to the seizure focus in patients with TLE (p < 0.001). No difference in the EC volumes ipsilateral and contralateral to the seizure focus was seen in patients with ETE and IGE compared with normal controls. The individual analysis showed that the EC was atrophic in 73% of TLE patients with hippocampal atrophy. Three of the seven TLE patients with normal volumetric MRI of the hippocampus and amygdala and normal histopathologic examination had EC atrophy ipsilateral to the seizure focus. In no patient with ETE or IGE was the EC found to be atrophic. Conclusions: EC atrophy ipsilateral to the seizure focus appears to be specific to mesial temporal lobe structural damage associated with TLE.

Methods: We studied FMTLE patients who underwent surgical treatment for refractory seizures. FMTLE was defined when at least two individuals in a family had a clinical EEG diagnosis of MTLE. Preoperative investigation included magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), interictal/ictal EEGs, and neuropsychological evaluation. We used Engel's classification for postoperative outcome. Results: To date, 20 FMTLE patients have been operated on, with 1.6 to 9.8 years of follow-up (mean, 5.5 years). Hippocampal atrophy (HA) and other signs of mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS) were present in 18 patients (15 unilateral). Seizures were recorded in 19 patients. Seventeen (85%) patients are in class I. Two patients had normal hippocampal volumes (HcV): one (5%) is in class 11 and the other (5%) in class IV (extratemporal seizures developed after surgery). One (5%) patient had bilateral HA and is in class III. Qualitative histopathology showed MTS with different degrees of severity. Conclusions: Refractory FMTLE patients have good surgical outcome when unilateral or clearly asymmetric HA is identified. Preoperative investigation should be the same as that in patients with sporadic refractory MTLE.

Yet its role must be multivalent as lesions reportedly diminish cortical fast activity and also cortical slow activity along with slow wave sleep (SWS). Basal forebrain cholinergic vs. GABAergic cell groups could differentially influence these processes. By labelling recorded neurons with Neurobiotin (Nb) using the juxtacellular technique and identifying them by immunostaining, we previously found that whereas all cholinergic cells increased their firing, the majority of GABAergic neurons decreased their firing in association with evoked cortical activation in urethane-anaesthetized rats. Here, we examined the possibility that such GABAergic, cortical activation 'off' cells might bear alpha 2 adrenergic receptors (alpha(2) AR) through which noradrenaline (NA) could inhibit them during cortical activation. First using simple dual-immunostaining for glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) and the alpha(2A) AR, we found that the majority (approximate to60%) of GAD-immunopositive (GAD+) neurons through the magnocellular preoptic nucleus (MCPO) and substantia innominata (SI) were labelled for the alpha(2A) AR. Second, in urethane-anaesthetized rats, we examined whether Nb-labelled, GAD+ cortical activation 'off' neurons that discharged maximally in association with cortical slow wave activity, were immunopositive for alpha(2A) AR. We found that all the Nb+/GAD+'off' cells were labelled for the alpha(2A) AR. Such cells could be inhibited in association with cortical activation and waking when noradrenergic locus coeruleus (LC) neurons discharge and be disinhibited with cortical slow waves and SWS when these neurons become inactive. We thus propose that alpha(2) AR-bearing GABAergic basal forebrain neurons constitute sleep-active and sleep-promoting neurons.

All participants were right-handed. Data from the affected right arm of patients with stroke were compared with those from the right arm of healthy subjects. Seated subjects made 25 pointing movements in a single session. Movements were made from an initial target located ipsilaterally to the right arm beside the body, to a final target located in front of the subject in the contralateral arm workspace. Kinematic data from the finger, wrist, elbow, both shoulders and sternum were recorded in three dimensions at 200 Hz with an optical tracking system. Analysis of interjoint coordination was based on the patterns of temporal delay between rotations at two adjacent joints (shoulder and elbow). The data were reduced to a single graph (Temporal Coordination or TC index) integrating the essential temporal characteristics of joint movement (the angular displacements, velocities and timing). TC segments, duration and amplitude, were analysed. The analysis was sensitive to the differences in interjoint coordination between healthy subjects and patients with arm motor deficits. In patients, the temporal coordination between elbow and shoulder movements was disrupted from the middle to the end of the reach. More specifically, in mid-reach, all patients had difficulty coordinating elbow flexion with shoulder horizontal adduction. In addition, patients with severe arm hemiparesis had difficulty changing elbow movement direction from flexion to extension and in coordinating this change with shoulder movement. At the end of the reach, patients with severe hemiparesis had deficits in the execution of elbow extension while all patients had impaired coordination of elbow extension and shoulder horizontal adduction. In addition, active ranges of joint motions were significantly decreased in the stroke compared to the healthy subjects. Finally, TC analysis revealed significant relationships between specific aspects of disrupted interjoint coordination and the level of motor impairment, suggesting that it may be a useful tool in the identification of specific movement coordination deficits in neurological impaired populations that can be targeted in treatment for arm motor recovery.

To identify new genes predisposing to schizophrenia, numerous groups have focused on CAG-repeat-containing genes. We previously reported a CAG repeat polymorphism that was shown to be associated with both the severity of the phenotype and the response to medication in schizophrenic patients. In this article, we now report the genomic structure of this gene, the retinoic acid inducible-1 gene (RA11), and present its characterization. This gene, located on chromosome 17p11.2, comprises six exons coding for a 7.6-kb mRNA. The RA11 gene is highly homologous to its mouse counterpart and it is expressed at high levels mainly in neuronal tissues. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science (USA). All rights reserved.

In order to examine this possibility, cultured astrocytes were exposed to TD and effects on glutamate transport and metabolic function were studied. TD led to decreases in cellular levels of thiamine and thiamine diphosphate (TDP) after 24 h of treatment and decreased activities of the TDP-dependent enzymes alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase and transketolase after 4 and 7 days, respectively. TD treatment for 10 days led to a reversible decrease in the uptake of [H-3]-D-aspartate, a nonmetabolizable analogue of glutamate. Kinetic analysis revealed that the uptake inhibition was caused by a 47% decrease in the V-max for uptake of [H-3]-D-aspartate, with no change in the K-m value. Immunoblotting showed that this decrease in uptake was due to an 81% downregulation of the astrocyte-specific GLAST glutamate transporter. Loss of uptake activity and GLAST protein were blocked by treatment with the protein kinase C inhibitor H7, while exposure to DCG IV, a group II metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) agonist, resulted in improvement of [H-3]-D-aspartate uptake and a partial reversal of transporter downregulation. These results are consistent with our recent in vivo findings of a loss of astrocytic glutamate transporters in TD and provide evidence that TD conditions may increase phosphorylation. of GLAST, contributing to its downregulation. In addition, manipulation of group II mGluR activity may provide an important strategy in the treatment of this disorder. (C) 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Such exposure patterns need further consideration in terms of styrene neurotoxicity. The aim of this study was to evaluate the neurotoxic effects of short-term peak exposures in volunteers, at levels respecting the Quebec occupational exposure limits (8 hours time weighed average of 213 mg/m(3) and 15 min average of 426 mg/m(3)). The volunteers had not been previously exposed to styrene and they had no documented exposure to known neurotoxicants during the study. Twenty-four volunteers were exposed to five exposure scenarios during 6 hours: a, stable exposure to 106 mg/m(3); b, variable exposure with a mean concentration of 106 mg/m(3) with four 15 min peaks mounting up to 213 mg/m(3); c, stable exposure to 213 mg/m(3); d, variable exposure with a mean concentration of 213 mg/m(3) and four peaks of 426 mg/m(3) and e, two stable exposures to 5 mg/m(3) (control). Before and after each exposure scenario, volunteers were submitted to a battery of sensory tests (visual and olfactory), neuropsychological tests (reaction time, attention, memory, psychomotor function), and self-evaluation questionnaires (mood and symptoms) in a test-retest design. The results show that the different exposure scenarios involving peak exposures did not influence either the performance to any test or subjective signs and symptoms. However, due caution must be exercised in extrapolation of the current results to occupational exposure since only acute exposures were tested and volunteers were at rest during exposure, which resulted in lower doses than those experienced by physically active workers.

DESIGN: SSIs had been identified by active prospective surveillance. A case-control study to identify risk factors was performed retrospectively. SETTING: University-associated, tertiary-care pediatric hospital. PATIENTS: All patients who underwent spinal surgery between 1994 and 1998. Cases were all patients who developed an SSI after spinal surgery. Controls were patients who did not develop an SSI, matched with the cases for the presence or absence of myelodysplasia and for the surgery date closest to that of the case. RESULTS: There were 10 infections following 125 posterior spinal fusions, 4 infections after 50 combined anterior-posterior fusions, and none after 95 other operations. The infection rate was higher in patients with myelodysplasia (32 per 100 operations) than in other patients (3.4 per 100 operations; relative risk = 9.45; P < .001). Gram-negative organisms were more common in early infections and Staphylococcus aureus in later infections. Most infections occurred in fusion involving sacral vertebrae (odds ratio [OR] = 12.0; P = .019). Antibiotic prophylaxis was more frequently suboptimal in cases than in controls (OR = 5.5; P = .034). Five patients required removal of instrumentation and 4 others required surgical debridement. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with myelodysplasia are at a higher risk for SSIs after spinal fusion. Optimal antibiotic prophylaxis may reduce the risk of infection, especially in high-risk patients such as those with myelodysplasia or those undergoing fusion involving the sacral area.

ENTH domains comprise multiple alpha-helices folded upon each other to form a compact globular structure that has been implicated in interactions with lipids and proteins. In characterizing this evolutionarily conserved domain, we isolated and identified tubulin as an ENTH domain-binding partner. The interaction, which is direct and has a dissociation constant of similar to1 muM, was observed with ENTH domains of proteins present in various species. Tubulin is co-immunoprecipitated from rat brain extracts with the ENTH domain-containing proteins, epsins 1 and 2, and punctate epsin staining is observed along the microtubule cytoskeleton of dissociated cortical neurons. Consistent with a role in microtubule processes, the over-expression of epsin ENTH domain in PC12 cells stimulates neurite outgrowth. These data demonstrate an evolutionarily conserved property of ENTH domains to interact with tubulin and microtubules.

Despite the growing literature supporting the clinical efficacy of olanzapine, psychiatrists still question its cognitive consequences. This study assessed the efficacy of olanzapine on neurocognitive functioning. Patients (N = 134) meeting diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia, schizophreniform, or schizoaffective disorders began an 8-week, open-label olanzapine treatment at a dose of 5 mg/d, which was increased to 10 mg/d after I week. Daily dosage was subsequently adjusted between 5 and 20 mg/d based on individual clinical status. All previous antipsychotics were tapered and discontinued during the first 2 weeks of the study. Neuropsychologic assessments were carried out at baseline and at 4 and 8 weeks. Explicit long-term memory was assessed with the Rey Auditory-Verbal Learning Test: the average immediate recall score significantly improved (P < 0.001), as did the delayed recall score (P < 0.001). The average total score on category fluency improved from 34.6 words at baseline to 37.6 words at end point (P < 0.0001). Time on both Trail A and B making tasks significantly decreased (P < 0.0001). Lack of a control arm makes it impossible to exclude a practice effect as an explanation for the enhanced cognitive performance, although the Word List Recall test represents one of the better resources to avoid a practice effect. After switching to olanzapine, there was a statistically significant improvement of cognitive function in the 3 main domains tested and no significant worsening of any memory or executive function measure.

Except for a few electrophysiological recordings from the entire group of these sensilla, no information is available on the response characteristics of any individual one. Using a compound microscope at 320x magnification, with a long working-distance objective, it has been possible to view individual sensilla and to record electrical responses from three of these to some gustatory stimuli in preliminary tests. One of them, sensillum (L1), contains a sugar-sensitive neuron whose responses to a range of sucrose concentrations are reported here. The physiological characteristics of this neuron differ from those of the known sugar-sensitive neuron in the lateral styloconic sensillum on the galea of these same insects. Input of chemosensory information about the same gustatory stimulus by more than one neuron in different mouthpart sensilla is discussed in relation to the feeding habits of the spruce budworm.

Two mammalian homologs of Staufen have been identified and shown to bind double-stranded RNA and tubulin, and to function in the somatodendritic transport of mRNA in neurons. Here, we examined whether Staufen proteins are expressed in skeletal muscle in relation to the neuromuscular junction. Immunofluorescence experiments revealed that Staufen1 (Stau1) and Staufen2 (Stau2) accumulate preferentially within the postsynaptic sarcoplasm of muscle fibers as well as at newly formed ectopic synapses. Western blot analyses showed that the levels of Stau1 and Stau2 are greater in slow muscles than in fast-twitch muscles. Muscle denervation induced a significant increase in the expression of Stau1 and Stau2 in the extrasynaptic compartment of both fast and slow muscles. Consistent with these observations, we also demonstrated that expression of Stau1 and Stau2 is increased during myogenic differentiation and that treatment of myotubes with agrin and neuregulin induces a further increase in the expression of both Staufen proteins. We propose that Stau1 and Stau2 are key components of the postsynaptic apparatus in muscle, and that they contribute to the maturation and plasticity of the neuromuscular junction.

We determined the evolution of MT changes in normal appearing white matter (NAWM) and lesion on serial examination of 9 multiple sclerosis (MS) patients and age matched controls. The mean NAWM MT ratio (MTR) was found to correlate strongly (R = 0.93) with the length of time since the patient's first clinical presentation and was well characterized by a linear decrease of -0.16%/year (p < 0.0001). The time zero intercept of the NAWM MTR regression was 30.7 +/- 0.2 %, not different from the average MTR of white matter from controls (30.4 +/- 0.2 %). An additional gradual decrease in NAWM MTR was observed 6 to 12 months before the appearance of a new lesion on conventional MRI, while a more precipitous decrease in MTR was seen 2 to 6 months before the lesion appeared. Those lesions that exhibited pre-lesion MTR decreases showed less MTR recovery than lesions which had no pre-legion MTR decrease. The data suggest that the MTR of NAWM in MS undergoes a slow progressive decrease that starts at disease onset and accelerates rapidly in focal areas just prior to lesion appearance on conventional MRI.

While the metrics of their discharges have been studied during conjugate saccades ( where the eyes rotate with similar dynamics), their role during disjunctive saccades ( where the eyes rotate with markedly different dynamics to account for differences in depths between saccadic targets) remains completely unexplored. In this report, we provide the first detailed quantification of the discharge dynamics of BT neurons during conjugate saccades, disjunctive saccades, and disjunctive fixation. We show that these neurons carry both significant eye position and eye velocity-related signals during conjugate saccades as well as smaller, yet important, "slide" and eye acceleration terms. Further, we demonstrate that a majority of BT neurons, during disjunctive fixation and disjunctive saccades, preferentially encode the position and the velocity of a single eye; only few BT neurons equally encode the movements of both eyes (i.e., have conjugate sensitivities). We argue that BT neurons in the nucleus prepositus hypoglossi/medial vestibular nucleus play an important role in the generation of unequal eye movements during disjunctive saccades, and carry appropriate information to shape the saccadic discharges of the abducens nucleus neurons to which they project.

NMDA and AP-5 in intact and late spinal cats	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article							METHYL-D-ASPARTATE; EXCITATORY AMINO-ACIDS; ELICITS FICTIVE LOCOMOTION; CENTRAL PATTERN GENERATOR; VITRO NEONATAL RAT; IN-VITRO; VOLTAGE OSCILLATIONS; MOTOR PATTERNS; TRANSMITTER RELEASE; PLATEAU POTENTIALS	In a previous article, we have shown that, in cats, intrathecal injections of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) in the first few days after spinalization at T-13 do not induce locomotion as in many other spinal preparations. This is in contrast to alpha-2 noradrenergic receptor stimulation, which can trigger locomotion at this early stage. However, it is known that spinal cats do recover spontaneous locomotion in the absence of descending noradrenergic pathways and that the spinal pattern generator must then depend on other neurotransmitters still present in the cord such as excitatory amino acids. In the present paper, therefore we look at the effects of intrathecal NMDA, a glutamatergic agonist, and 2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (AP-5), an NMDA receptor blocker, in both intact and late spinal cats. Low doses of NMDA had no major effect on the locomotor pattern in both intact and late spinal cats. Larger doses of NMDA in the chronic spinal cat initially produced an increase in the general excitability followed by more regular locomotion. AP-5 in intact cats caused a decrease in the amplitude of the flexion reflex and induced a bilateral foot drag as well as some decrease in weight support but it did not prevent locomotion. However, in late spinal cats, the same dose of AP-5 blocked locomotion completely. These results indicate that NMDA receptors may be critical for the spontaneous expression of spinal locomotion. It is proposed that the basic locomotor rhythmicity in cats is NMDA-dependent and that normally this glutamatergic mechanism is modulated by other neurotransmitters, such as 5-HT and NA.

We first altered motor excitability by applying low-frequency repetitive TMS over two cortical motor regions in separate experiments: the dorsal premotor and primary motor cortices. We then assessed the consequences of modulating motor excitability by applying single-pulse TMS over the primary motor cortex and measuring: 1) muscle responses with electromyography and 2) cerebral blood flow with PET. Low-frequency repetitive stimulation reduced muscle responses to a similar degree in both experiments. To map networks of brain regions in which activity changes reflected modulation of motor excitability, we generated t-statistical maps of correlations between reductions in muscle response and differences in cerebral blood flow. Low-frequency repetitive stimulation altered neural activity differently in both experiments. Neural modulation occurred in multiple brain regions after dorsal premotor cortex stimulation; these included motor regions in the frontal cortex as well as more associational regions in the parietal and prefrontal cortices. In contrast, neural modulation occurred in a smaller number of brain regions after primary motor cortex stimulation, many of these confined to the motor system. These findings are consistent with the known differences between the dorsal premotor and primary motor cortices in the extent of cortico-cortical anatomical connectivity in the monkey.

In previous studies, [Dmt(1)]DALDA displayed a mechanism of action distinct from that of morphine, as evidenced by its insensitivity to antisense probes reducing morphine analgesia and incomplete cross tolerance to morphine. In an effort to further elucidate the unusual mechanism of action, [H-3][Dmt(1)]DALDA has been synthesized and its binding profile studied. [H-3][Dmt(1)]DALDA binding was high affinity (K-D = 0.22 nM) and showed a regional distribution consistent with mu-receptors with highest levels in calf striatal membranes. [H-3][Dmt(1)]DALDA binding was far less sensitive than [H-3][D-Ala(2),N-Me-Phe(4),Gly(5)-ol]-enkephalin (DAMGO) to the effects of divalent and sodium cations and guanine nucleotides, although NaCl and guanosine 5'-(beta,gamma-imido) triphosphate together reduced specific [H-3][Dmt(1)]DALDA binding levels by almost 75%. Competition studies confirmed the mu-selectivity of the binding, with K-i values that were not appreciably different from those seen against [H-3]DAMGO. In guanosine 5'-O-(3-[S-35]thio)triphosphate ([S-35]GTPgammaS) binding assays in brain and spinal cord membranes, [Dmt(1)]DALDA was more potent than DAMGO, but showed plateaus suggestive of a partial agonist. [Dmt(1)]DALDA bound to mu-opioid receptor clone 1 (MOR-1) and its splice variants with high affinity. Unlike [H-3] DAMGO, [H-3][Dmt(1)]DALDA seemed to label both agonist and antagonist conformations of MOR-1 expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells. In [S-35]GTPgammaS assays [Dmt(1)]DALDA showed high efficacy with all the MOR-1 variants, but its potency (EC50) varied markedly among some of the splice variants despite similar affinities in receptor binding assays. Although [H-3][Dmt(1)]DALDA is a very potent mu-selective analgesic, its binding characteristics and its ability to stimulate GTPgammaS binding differed from that of the classical mu-opioid peptide DAMGO.

Here we investigated the involvement of Nav1.8 in ectopic impulse generation in damaged axons by examining spontaneous activity and mechanosensitivity in neuromas formed by section of the saphenous nerve in Nav1.8 null mice and in their wild-type littermates. We recorded 522 identified units from 24 neuromas in vitro at two time points, 8-11 days (median 10 days) and 19-29 days (median 22 days) post-operatively. At similar to10 days, neither genotype showed spontaneous activity, but a significantly higher proportion of fibres were mechanosensitive in wild-type (54%) compared to Nav1.8 null neuromas (18%). At similar to22 days, 19% of fibres recorded in wild-type neuromas showed spontaneous activity, whereas only one fibre of the 238 (0.4%) recorded in neuromas taken from nun mice showed ongoing activity. In recordings at similar to22 days, a similar proportion of fibres were mechanosensitive in wild-type and Nav1.8 null neuromas (51 and 46%, respectively). We conclude that Nav1.8 is essential for the expression of spontaneous activity in damaged sensory axons, and may also contribute to the development of ectopic mechanosensitivity.

DESIGN: Prospective population-based cohort with four interview waves and complete vital status ascertainment. SETTING: Urban and rural communities in the Aquitaine Region (Gironde and Dordogne), southwest France. PARTICIPANTS: Three thousand seven hundred seventy-seven adults aged 65 and older residing in noninstitutional settings at study baseline. MEASUREMENTS: Each participant was interviewed by a neuropsychologist and screened for dementia with the Mini-Mental State Examination, a cognitive test battery, and a standardized questionnaire designed to ascertain the presence of the criteria for dementia according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders, Third Edition, Revised (DSM-III-R). Dementia status and subtype were confirmed using neurological examination and categorized according to DSM-III-R criteria for dementia and the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke/Alzheimer's and Related Disorders Association criteria. The Hachinski score was calculated to specify the etiology: possible or probable Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia, and other types of dementia. Depressive symptomatology was evaluated using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression scale. Statistical analyses were weighted to correct for attrition not due to mortality. RESULTS: Ninety-seven men (incidence rate: 14.4/1,000) and 183 women (Incidence rate: 19.0/1,000) developed dementia during 8 years of follow-up. Baseline prevalence of depressive symptomatology was 12.9% for men and 14.7% for women. Depressive symptoms increased risk of dementia at subsequent interview wave, but only for men (odds ratio (OR) (men) = 3.5, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.9-6.5; OR (women) = 1.2, 95% CI = 0.7-2.0, P -value for sex difference = 0.03). The hypothesis that vascular depression might explain the observed sex difference was studied, and it was found that risk was 50% higher for men with hypertension who were depressed than for normotensive men. For women, hypertension status did not modify the absence of an association. CONCLUSION: This study supports the hypothesis of a relationship between proximal depressive symptomatology and dementia in men, but distant depression did not increase dementia risk in this sample. The results suggest that depression in older men might reflect a form of vascular depression associated with cerebral vascular pathology or multiinfarct disease that may amplify the dementing or declining process, hence accelerating the onset of manifest symptoms of dementia.

Continued expression of RPTPsigma in the adult suggests that it plays a functional role in the mature nervous system. To determine if RPTPsigma might influence axonal regeneration, the time course of regeneration following facial nerve crush in wild-type and RPTPsigma (-/-) mice was compared. Mice lacking RPTPsigma exhibited an accelerated rate of functional recovery. Immumocytochemical examination of wild-type neurons in cell culture showed RPTPsigma protein in the growth cone. To determine if RPTPsigma affects the ability of a neuron to extend an axon, the rate of axon growth in neuronal cultures derived from wild-type and RPTPsigma (-/-) embryonic mice was compared. RPTPsigma did not affect the rate of axon initiation, but the rate of axon extension is enhanced in neurons obtained from RPTPsigma (-/-) mice. These findings indicate that RPTPsigma slows axon growth via a mechanism intrinsic to the neuron and identify a role for RPTPsigma regulating axonal regeneration by motoneurons.

In order to study the impact of these lesions on cognitive functioning, in particular on executive functions and spatial abilities, an investigation was carried out on a right-handed patient with lesions in the subcortical structures of the right hemisphere. Findings revealed a complex pattern of neuropsychological impairments that included a memory deficit, neglect and anosognosia. In addition, there was a severe executive function syndrome. Finally, observations show impairments in spatial abilities, usually attributed to right parietal damage. There was no obvious language deficit. The pattern of deficits was interpreted as a disconnection syndrome.

Before and after each scan subjects gave ratings of hunger/fullness and desire to eat. In addition, meal pleasantness ratings were collected immediately after consumption of the favorite meal. PET data were analyzed using brain parametric maps to generate regions of statistically significant change, as well as regions of interest manually drawn on each individual's coregistered anatomical image. [C-11]Raclopride binding potential was compared across the two states (hungry and full). A significant reduction in binding potential was observed in the full compared to the hungry state in the dorsal putamen and caudate nucleus, indicative of dopamine release. There were no changes elsewhere in the striatum. A correlation was observed between the reduction in [C-11]raclopride binding and meal pleasantness ratings, but not with desire to eat (hunger) or satiety after eating. These results suggest that feeding is associated with dopamine release in the dorsal, but not the ventral striatum, and that the amount of dopamine released correlates with the degree of experienced pleasure.

Genistein reversibly and concentration-dependently depressed I-Gly, with an IC50 of 13 muM. Preincubation with genistein had no effect on I-Gly, indicating that genistein is effective only when glycine is bound to the receptor and channels are most likely open. Genistein depressed maximum I-Gly without significantly changing the EC50 for glycine. Genistein-induced inhibition of I-Gly was sensitive to membrane voltage, being greater at positive membrane potentials. A kinetic analysis indicated that genistein lengthens the time constant of I-Gly activation, but has no effect on deactivation or desensitization. When genistein was rapidly washed out, a transient rebound current probably reflected a faster dissociation of genistein, with respect to glycine. Results of competition experiments suggest that genistein acts on the same region of the glycine receptor as picrotoxin. Daidzein, an analog of genistein that does not act on protein kinases, also inhibited I-Gly. Co-application of lavendustin A, a specific inhibitor of tyrosine kinase, had no effect on I-Gly. Our results extend to neurons isolated from the VTA, the previous finding that genistein directly inhibits glycine receptors of hypothalamic brain slices. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

We designed this retrospective study to assess the incidence and severity of VAE, the incidence of paradoxical air embolism, and the occurrence of patent foramen ovale, as detected with transesophageal echocardiography, as well as the effects of its detection on patient treatment. METHODS: After institutional review board approval, data were collected from the charts of all patients who underwent selective peripheral denervation at our institution between 1988 and 2001. The severity of VAE was assessed by using a 5-point scale. RESULTS: data for 342 patients were available for analyses. Seven patients exhibited VAE, yielding an incidence of 2%. The severity of VAE was 2/5 for three patients, 3/5 for three patients, and 4/5 for one patient. Air could be aspirated from the central venous catheter for three patients. No deaths occurred. Among the 96 transesophageal echocardiographic examinations performed, 5 cases of patent foramen ovale were detected (5.2%). For those patients, surgery was performed in the prone or park-bench position. No paradoxical air embolism was detected. CONCLUSION: This is the first large study to directly assess the incidence and severity of VAE among patients undergoing selective peripheral denervation in the sitting position. We recommend that the detection of a patent foramen ovale prompt a change in position for this surgical procedure.

It has recently been suggested that blood Mn (MnB) may interact with alcohol use disorders, accentuating neuropsychiatric symptoms. The objective of the present study was to explore a possible interaction between alcohol consumption and MnB on mood states, using an existing data set on Mn exposed workers. Respirable Mn exposure in the plant averaged 0.23 mg/m(3) and was correlated with MnB. All participants for whom all data on MnB concentration and mood (assessed with the Profile of Mood States (POMS)) were available and who reported currently drinking alcohol were included in the analyses (n = 74). Workers were grouped according to their MnB concentration (<10 and greater than or equal to10 mug/l) and alcohol consumption (<400 and greater than or equal to400 g per week). Two-way ANOVAs were performed on each POMS scale and Mann-Whitney tests were used to assess group differences. Workers in the higher alcohol consumption group had higher scores on three POMS scales: tension, anger and fatigue. There was no difference for POMS scale scores between MnB subgroups. Dividing the group with respect to alcohol consumption and MnB showed that the group with high alcohol consumption and high MnB displayed the highest scores. In the lower MnB category, those in the higher alcohol consumption group did not have higher scores than the others. The interaction term for alcohol consumption and MnB concentration was statistically significant (P < 0.05) for the depression, anger fatigue and confusion POMS scales. There was a tendency for tension (P < 0.06), and it was not significant for vigor. This study shows the first evidence of an interaction between MnB and alcohol consumption on mood states among Mn exposed workers and supports the results from a previous population-based study.

Exposure to high doses of manganese is associated with irreversible neurodegenerative disorders resembling idiopathic Parkinson disease. Although there is a risk of Mn accumulation in the foetus during pregnancy, little information exists about developmental effects of environmental low-level exposure in human. For this reason, we conducted a prospective epidemiological study in 247 healthy pregnant women and their babies to determine the long-term effect of in utero Mn levels on child's psychomotor development. Concurrently, we examined the relationship between Mn tissue levels at delivery and foetal plasma monoamine metabolites. Of the newborns, 195 were examined at 9 months, 126 at 3 years and 100 at 6 years. At 9 months, the Brunet-Lezine scales were administered. The McCarthy scales of children's abilities were used at 3 and 6 years. After adjustment for potential confounding co-factors (child's gender, mother's educational level), negative relationships were observed between cord blood Mn levels and several psychomotor sub-scales at age of 3 years: attention (partial r = -0.33, P < 0.001), non-verbal memory (partial r = -0.28, P < 0.01), and hand skills (partial r = -0.22, P < 0.05). No significant relationships were observed between Mn measures at birth and the general psychomotor indices, Brunet-Lezine developmental quotient (DQ) at 9 months or McCarthy general cognitive index (GCI) at 3 and 6 years. Maternal blood Mn levels were negatively associated with foetal plasma HVA and 5-HIAA concentrations (adjusted for labour duration, child's gender, and smoking during pregnancy), but the adjustment for monoamine levels at birth did not change the association between the Mn levels and the psychomotor scores. These results suggest that environmental Mn exposure in utero could affect early psychomotor development. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

The recent identification of the NMU receptor Subtype 2 (NMU2R) in the spinal cord has increased the interest in investigating the role of NMU in this part of the central nervous system. Here, we report a novel function for NMU in spinal nociception in the mouse. Systemic perfusion of NMU (rat, NMU-23) dose-dependently (0.2, 0.5, 1, and 2.5 muM) potentiated both the background activity and noxious pinch-evoked response of nociceptive or wide dynamic range, but not non-nociceptive, dorsal horn neurons. At 2.5 muM, NMU-23 increased the total background activity from 154 +/- 34 to 1374 +/- 260 spikes/160 s (P < 0.005, n = 28) and increased the evoked nociceptive response by 185 +/- 50% (P < 0.01, n = 13). Intrathecal administration of NMU-23 (0.4, 1.1, and 3.8 nmnol/10 mul) dose-dependently decreased thermal withdrawal latencies and produced a morphine-sensitive behavioral response. These electrophysiological and behavioral results suggest that NMU may be a novel physiological regulator in spinal nociceptive transmission and processing.

Fischer and Lewis rats exhibit differential behavioral responses to central NT receptor activation. To further characterize these differences, we assessed central NT-induced analgesia and hypothermia in independent groups of rats from each strain. Fischer and Lewis rats showed a similar dose-orderly analgesic response in a hot-plate test. Such an isosensitivity was not observed for NT-induced hypothermia. Although NT produced a dose-orderly decrease in mean rectal temperature in both strains, the magnitude of the hypothermic response was significantly smaller in Fischer than in Lewis rats. These findings provide further evidence of genetic differences in central neurotensinergeric neurotransmission in these two strains. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

An EFE decoding test consisting of 16 photographs of EFE portraying happiness, anger, sadness and disgust was administered to five different groups of 30 subjects each: recently detoxified alcoholics (RA); opiate addicts under methadone maintenance treatment (OM); detoxified opiate addicts (OA); detoxified subjects with both alcohol and opiate dependence antecedents (DAO); and normal controls (NC). Repeated measures analysis of variance using a multivariate approach was conducted on EFE decoding accuracy scores with group as the between-subjects factor. Accuracy scores were significantly lower in RA and DAO than in OM and OA, which had significantly lower scores than NC. Low accuracy scores in RA and DAO confirm previous results indicating that alcoholism is associated with impaired EFE recognition. Results in OM and OA indicate that opiate dependence is also associated with an impaired EFE decoding but less than in alcoholism. Alcohol and opiate chronic consumption could both exercise a deleterious effect on EFE-decoding brain function, alcohol having the most severe impact. Alternatively, EFE-decoding problems could be present before the development of alcohol and opiate dependence, with an additional effect of chronic alcohol consumption on EFE decoding. In this context, EFE-decoding impairment could reflect a more general emotional intelligence deficit in addicted populations. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Molecular biological techniques have led to the identification of alterations in expression of several genes coding for key astrocytic proteins in acute liver failure. Such proteins include amino acid transporters, structural proteins, the endothelial cell glucose transporter GLUT-1, the mitochondrial "peripheral-type" benzodiazepine receptor, and the water channel protein aquaporin IV. Magnetic resonance spectrescopic studies reveal increased brain lactate concentrations that are positively correlated with severity of encephalopathy and brain edema in acute liver failure, suggesting a deficit of cellular oxidative capacity and impending brain energy failure. Mild hypothermia prevents brain edema in acute liver failure, and mechanisms responsible for this beneficial effect include reduced blood-brain ammonia transfer as well as normalization of astrocytic amino acid transport and brain energy metabolism. Further elucidation of the molecular mechanisms responsible for brain edema and encephalopathy in acute liver failure will undoubtedly lead to novel treatment strategies for these complications.

However, Y-2 and Y-5 receptor levels have been reported to increase and decrease, respectively, in the epileptic hippocampus, implicating that the profile of NPY effects may change accordingly. The aim of this study was to evaluate the differential effects of NPY on glutamate release in the normal and in the epileptic hippocampus. Thus, we pharmacologically characterized the effects of NPY on the release of [H-3]D-aspartate, a valid marker of endogenous glutamate, from synaptosomes prepared from the whole hippocampus and from the three hippocampal. subregions (dentate gyrus and CA1 and CA3 subfields) of control and kindled rats, killed 1 week after the last stimulus-evoked seizure. In the whole hippocampus, NPY does not significantly affect stimulus-evoked [H-3]D-aspartate overflow. In synaptosomes prepared from control rats, NPY significantly inhibited 15 mM K+-evoked [H-3]D-aspartate overflow only in the CA1 subfield (approx. -30%). Both Y-2 and Y-5 receptor antagonists (respectively, 1 muM BIIE0246 and 1 muM CGP71683A) prevented this effect, suggesting the involvement of both receptor types. In contrast, in synaptosomes prepared from kindled rats NPY significantly inhibited 15 mM K+-evoked [H-3]D-aspartate overflow in the CA1 subfield and in the dentate gyrus (approx. -30%). Only the Y-2 (not the Y-5) antagonist prevented these effects. These data indicate a critical role for the Y-2 receptor in the inhibitory control of glutamate release in the kindled hippocampus and, thus, suggest that the anticonvulsant effect of NPY in the epileptic brain is most likely Y-2 but not Y-5, receptor-mediated.

However, there is increasing evidence that humans are born with musical predispositions that develop spontaneously into sophisticated knowledge bases and procedures that are unique to music. Recent findings also suggest that the brain is equipped with music-specific neural networks and that these can be selectively compromised by a congenital anomaly. This results in a disorder, congenital amusia, that appears to be limited to the processing of music. Recent evidence points to fine-grained perception of pitch as the root of musical handicap. Hence, musical abilities appear to depend crucially on the fine-tuning of pitch, in much the same way that language abilities rely on fine time resolution.

The correct categorization of both intact and rearranged pairs relative to pairs of new, never presented before stimuli relies on the retrieval of associative information whereas the discrimination of rearranged pairs from intact pairs additionally involves a recall-to-reject process by which subjects retrieve additional information to reach a recognition decision. Relative to new pairs, both intact and rearranged pairs yielded activation in inferior prefrontal cortex bilaterally and left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Relative to intact pairs, rearranged pairs were associated with increased activity in left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. The latter could reflect the neural correlates of a recall-to-reject process, a pivotal process of associative recognition memory. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

It is not known how CNS trauma affects the expression and activation of RhoA. Here we detect GTP-bound RhoA in spinal cord homogenates and report that spinal cord injury (SCI) in both rats and mice activates RhoA over 10-fold in the absence of changes in RhoA expression. In situ Rho-GTP detection revealed that both neurons and glial cells showed Rho activation at SCI lesion sites. Application of a Rho antagonist (C3-05) reversed Rho activation and reduced the number of TUNEL-labeled cells by similar to50% in both injured mouse and rat, showing a role for activated Rho in cell death after CNS injury. Next, we examined the role of the p75 neurotrophin receptor (P75(NTR)) in Rho signaling. After SCI, an up-regulation of p75(NTR) was detected by Western blot and observed in both neurons and glia. Treatment with C3-05 blocked the increase in p75(NTR) expression. Experiments with p75(NTR)- null mutant mice showed that immediate Rho activation after SCI is p75(NTR) dependent. Our results indicate that blocking overactivation of Rho after SCI protects cells from p75(NTR)- dependent apoptosis.

A glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored form of this enzyme is expressed by astrocytes in the mammalian central nervous system, whereas the secreted form is expressed by the liver and found in serum. Lack of this enzyme results in iron accumulation in the brain and neurodegeneration. Herein, we show using astrocytes purified from the central nervous system of Cp-null mice that GPI-Cp is essential for iron efflux and not involved in regulating iron influx. We also show that GPI-Cp colocalizes on the astrocyte cell surface with the divalent metal transporter IREG1 and is physically associated with IREG1. In addition, IREG1 alone is unable to efflux iron from astrocytes in the absence of GPI-Cp or secreted Cp. We also provide evidence that the divalent metal influx transporter DMT1 is expressed by astrocytes and is likely to mediate iron influx into these glial cells.

This splicing event is conserved over evolution and, in Aplysia, results in a two amino acid insert in the juxtamembrane domain of Syt I (Syt I-VQ). Both Syt I and Syt I-VQ are localized to synaptic vesicles; however, we also observed punctae that contained one or the other spliced products. Both Syt I and Syt I-VQ are phosphorylated at the adjacent PKC site. Overexpression of Syt I-VQ, but not of Syt I, in Aplysia neurons blocked the ability of serotonin to reverse synaptic depression. This effect is upstream of PKC activation, because neither Syt IVQ nor Syt I blocked the effects of phorbol esters on reversing synaptic depression or the effects of serotonin on facilitating nondepressed synapses. Our results demonstrate a physiological role for splicing in the juxtamembrane domain of Syt I.

Methods and Results - Normal dogs (n = 8) were compared with dogs with MR of 2 (n = 8) and 4 (n = 6) weeks' duration and with dogs with MR treated with beta(1)-receptor blockade (RB; extended-release metoprolol succinate, 100 mg QD; MR + beta(1)-RB) that was started 24 hours after MR induction for 2 (n = 6) and 4 weeks (n - 8). Left ventricular end-diastolic dimension increased 20% as plasma Ang II levels increased >5-fold in both MR and MR + beta(1)-RB dogs at 2 and 4 weeks. Ang II infusion into the left atrium produced increases in ISF NE and Epi in normal dogs, which were further increased in 2- and 4-week MR dogs but were restored to normal in 4-week MR + beta(1)-RB dogs. Ang II infusion produced 4-fold increases in circulating NE and Epi in 2- and 4-week MR dogs that returned to normal in 4-week + beta(1)-RB dogs. Left ventricular angiotensin-converting enzyme activity and ISF Ang II were increased in 4-week MR dogs but were decreased in 4-week MR + beta(1)-RB dogs. Conclusions - beta(1)-RB decreases renin-angiotensin system sympathostimulation and activation by attenuating the Ang II-mediated NE and Epi release into the cardiac ISF and circulation and by decreasing left ventricular angiotensin-converting enzyme expression in the early phases of volume overload.

The present study provides the first comprehensive description of the distribution of NTS3/sortilin mRNA and protein in adult rat brain using in situ hybridization and immunocytochemistry. Both NTS3/sortilin mRNA and immunoreactivity displayed a widespread distribution throughout the brain. High levels of NTS3/sortilin expression and immunoreactivity were found in neuronal cell bodies and dendrites of allo-cortical areas such as the piriform cortex and hippocampus. Regions expressing both high levels of NTS3/sortilin mRNA and protein also included several neocortical areas, the islands of Calleja, medial and lateral septal nuclei, amygdaloid nuclei, thalamic nuclei, the supraoptic nucleus, the substantia nigra, and the Purkinje cell layer of the cerebellar cortex. In the brainstem, all cranial nerve motor nuclei were strongly labeled. NTS3/sortilin mRNA and immunoreactivity were also detected over oligodendrocytes in major fiber tracts. Subcellularly, NTS3/sortilin was predominantly concentrated over intracytoplasmic membrane-bound organelles. Many of the areas exhibiting high levels of NTS3/sortilin (e.g., olfactory cortex, medial septum, and periaqueductal gray) have been documented to contain high concentrations of NT nerve cell bodies and axons, supporting the concept that NTS3/sortilin may play a role in NT sorting and/or signaling. Other areas (e.g., hippocampal CA fields, cerebellar cortex, and cranial nerve motor nuclei), however, are NT-negative, suggesting that NTS3/sortilin also exerts functions unrelated to NT signaling.

In the present study, alterations of kinin receptors in the brain of amygdaloid-kindled rats were assessed by means of in vitro autoradiography, using I-125-labeled 3-4 hydroxyphenyl-propionyl-desArg(9)-D-Arg(9)-[Hyp(3), Thi(5), D-Tic(7), Oic(8)]-bradykinin (B-1 receptors) and I-125-labeled 3-4 hydroxyphenyl-propionyl-D-Arg(0)-[Hyp3, Thi(5), D-Tic(7), Oic(8)]-bradykinin (B-2 receptors) as ligands. Results demonstrate that B-2 receptors are widely distributed throughout the brain of control rats. The highest densities were observed in lateral septal nucleus, median preoptic nucleus, dentate gyrus, amygdala, spinal trigeminal nucleus, mediovestibular nucleus, inferior cerebellar peduncles, and in most of cortical regions (0.81-1.4 fmol/mg tissue). In contrast, very, low densities of B1 receptors were detected in all analyzed areas from control rats (0.18-0.26 fmol/mg tissue). When assessed in kindled rats, specific binding sites for B-2 receptors were significantly decreased (41 to 76%) in various brain areas. Conversely, B-1 receptor binding sites were markedly increased in kindled rats, especially in hippocampus (CA2 congruent to CA1 congruent to CA3), Amy and entorhinal, peririnal/piriform, and occipital cortices (152-258%). Data show for the first time that kindling-induced epilepsy results in a significant decline of B-2 receptor binding sites, accompanied by a striking increase of B-1 receptor labeling in the rat brain. An altered balance between B-1 and B-2 receptor populations may play a pivotal role in the onset and/or maintenance of epilepsy. (C) 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

NTS2-like immunoreactivity was broadly distributed throughout the rat brain. At the cellular level, the reaction product was exclusively associated with neurons and predominantly, although not exclusively, with their dendritic arbors. No NTS2 signal was observed over astrocytes, as confirmed by dual confocal microscopic immunofluorescence studies using the astrocytic marker S100beta. High densities of NTS2-like immunoreactive nerve cell bodies and/or processes were detected in many regions documented to receive a dense neurotensinergic innervation, such as the olfactory bulb, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, magnocellular preoptic nucleus, amygdaloid complex, anterodorsal thalamic nucleus, substantia nigra, ventral tegmental area, and several brainstem nuclei. Most conspicuous among the latter were structures implicated in the descending control of nociceptive inputs (e.g., the periaqueductal gray, dorsal raphe, gigantocellular reticular nucleus, pars alpha, lateral paragigan-tocellular, and raphe magnus), in keeping with the postulated role of NTS2 receptors in the mediation of neurotensin's supraspinal antinociceptive actions. However, the distribution of NTS2-like immunoreactivity largely exceeded that of neurotensin terminal fields, and some of the highest concentrations of the receptor were found in areas devoid of neurotensinergic inputs such as the cerebral cortex, the hippocampus, and the cerebellum, suggesting that neurotensin may not be the exclusive endogenous ligand for this receptor subtype.

Here, the endogenous heat shock response of motor neurons was investigated to determine whether a high threshold for activating this protective mechanism contributes to their vulnerability to stresses associated with ALS. When heat shocked, cultured motor neurons failed to express Hsp70 or transactivate a green fluorescent protein reporter gene driven by the Hsp70 promoter, although Hsp70 was induced in glial cells. No increase in Hsp70 occurred in motor neurons after exposure to excitotoxic glutamate or expression of mutant SOD-1 with a glycine-->alanine substitution at residue 93 (G93A), nor was Hsp70 increased in spinal cords of G93A SOD-1 transgenic mice or sporadic or familial ALS patients. In contrast, strong Hsp70 induction occurred in motor neurons with expression of a constitutively active form of heat shock transcription factor (HSF)-1 or when proteasome activity was sufficiently inhibited to induce accumulation of an alternative transcription factor HSF2. These results indicate that the high threshold for induction of the stress response in motor neurons stems from an impaired ability to activate the main heat shock-stress sensor, HSF1.

Subjects used two different strategies to solve a place-learning task in a computer-generated virtual environment. One-half of the subjects used spatial landmarks to navigate in the early phase of training, and these subjects showed increased activation of the right hippocampus. The other half used a nonspatial strategy and showed, with practice, sustained increased activity within the caudate nucleus during navigation. Activation common to both groups was observed in the posterior parietal and frontal cortex. These results provide the first evidence for spontaneous variability and shift in neural mechanisms during navigation in humans.

(OMIM 218000) is an autosomal recessive disease of early onset characterized by a delay in developmental milestones, a severe sensory-motor polyneuropathy with areflexia, a variable degree of agenesis of the corpus callosum, amyotrophy, hypotonia, and cognitive impairment. Although this disorder has rarely been reported worldwide, it has a high prevalence in the Saguenay-Lac-St-Jean region of the province of Quebec (Canada) predominantly because of a founder effect. The gene defect responsible for this disorder recently has been identified, and it is a protein-truncating mutation in the SLC12A6 gene, which codes for a cotransporter protein known as KCC3. Herein, we provide the first extensive review of this disorder, covering epidemiological, clinical, and molecular genetic studies.

We observed four families in which carrier women had normal brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and mild mental retardation, with or without epilepsy. Affected male subjects had SBH or pachygyria-SBH. In two families, the phenotype was mild in both genders. In the first family, we found a tyr138his mutation that is predicted to result in abnormal folding in the small hinge region. In the second family, we found an arg178cys mutation at the initial portion of R2, in the putative beta-sheet structure. Carrier female subjects with normal MRI showed no somatic mosaicism or altered X-inactivation in lymphocytes, suggesting a correlation between mild mutations and phenotypes. In the two other families, with severely affected boys, we found arg76ser and arg56gly mutations within the R1 region that are predicted to affect DCX folding, severely modifying its activity. Both carrier mothers showed skewed X-inactivation, possibly explaining their mild phenotypes. Missense DCX mutations may manifest as non-syndromic mental retardation with cryptogenic epilepsy in female subjects and SBH in boys. Mutation analysis in mothers of affected children is mandatory, even when brain MRI is normal.

Methods and results: A questionnaire PQRS-Montreal 1.0 was developed in Montreal, Quebec using a standardized methodology that incorporated a new technique to reach consensus regarding the tool's contents. Five dimensions of care (i.e. ecological approach, client-centred approach, accessibility, quality of the service providers and continuity) and their corresponding standards were identified as pertinent to include in the tool and were subsequently validated by experts. A phase of item generation followed that led to the development of an 87-item prototype of the questionnaire. The questionnaire is to be administered during an interview and employs a 5-point rating scale. Discussion and conclusion: The implications for the use of PQRS-Montreal 1.0 in the accreditation process of head injury rehabilitation services are discussed, as well as plans for future quantitative research in the development of the tool.

J	Yamaguchi, N; Minassian, TR; Yamaguchi, S				Yamaguchi, N; Minassian, TR; Yamaguchi, S			Effects of PACAP(1-27) on the canine endocrine pancreas in vivo: interaction with cholinergic mechanism	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY AND PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						atropine; PACAP; PAC(1); muscarinic; interaction	CYCLASE-ACTIVATING POLYPEPTIDE; ADENYLATE-CYCLASE; INSULIN-SECRETION; CATECHOLAMINE SECRETION; INTESTINAL POLYPEPTIDE; HYPOGLYCEMIC STRESS; NEUROPEPTIDE PACAP; ANESTHETIZED DOGS; GLUCAGON-RELEASE; CELL-MEMBRANES	The aim of the present study was to characterize the effects of pituitary adenylate cyclase activating poly peptide (PACAP) on the endocrine pancreas in anesthetized dogs. PACAP(1-27) and a PACAP receptor (PAC(1)) blocker, PACAP(6-27), were locally administered to the pancreas. PACAP(1-27) (0.005-5 mug) increased basal insulin and glucagon secretion in a dose-dependent manner. PACAP(6-27) (200 mug) blocked the glucagon response to PACAP(1-27) (0.5 mug) by about 80%, while the insulin response remained unchanged. With a higher dose of PACAP(6-27) (500 mug), both responses to PACAP(1-27) were inhibited by more than 80%. In the presence of atropine with an equivalent dose (128.2 mug) of PACAP(6-27) (500 mug) on a molar basis, the insulin response to PACAP(1-27) was diminished by about 20%, while the glucagon response was enhanced by about 80%. The PACAP(1-27)-induced increase in pancreatic venous blood flow was blocked by PACAP(6-27) but not by atropine. The study suggests that the endocrine secretagogue effect of PACAP(1-27) is primarily mediated by the PAC(1) receptor, and that PACAP(1-27) may interact with muscarinic receptor function in PACAP-induced insulin and glucagon secretion in the canine pancreas in vivo.

Evidence from repetition priming of Mooney faces of familiar and unfamiliar persons	COGNITIVE BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						face perception; N170; modularity; top-down effect; penetrability; repetition	INFERIOR TEMPORAL CORTEX; HUMAN EXTRASTRIATE CORTEX; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; HUMAN FUSIFORM GYRUS; HUMAN BRAIN; DOMAIN SPECIFICITY; CONTRAST POLARITY; VISUAL-PERCEPTION; RECOGNITION; MEMORY	Impoverished images of faces, two-tone Mooney faces, severely impair the ability to recognize to whom the face pertains. However, previously seeing the corresponding face in a clear format helps fame-judgments to Mooney faces. In the present experiment, we sought to demonstrate that enhancement in the perceptual encoding of Mooney faces results from top-down effects, due to previous activation of familiar face representation. Event-related potentials (ERPs) were obtained for target Mooney images of familiar and unfamiliar faces preceded by clear pictures portraying either the same photo (same photo prime), or a different photo of the same person (different photo prime) or a new unfamiliar face (no-prime). In agreement with previous findings the use of primes was effective in enhancing the recognition of familiar faces in Mooney images; this priming effect was larger in the same than in different photo priming condition. ERP data revealed that the amplitude of the N170 face-sensitive component was smaller when elicited by familiar than by unfamiliar face targets, and for familiar face targets primed by the same than by different photos (a graded priming effect). Because the priming effect was restricted to familiar faces and occurred at the peak of the N170, we suggest that the early perceptual stage of face processing is likely to be penetrable by the top-down effect due to the activation of face representations within the face recognition system.

However, it is still unclear whether these activations reflect item- or task-related activities. In the present study, Event-Related Potentials (ERPs) were used to distinguish item-related activity from task-related activity in both encoding and retrieval processes. This activity was assessed with both verbal and non-verbal material. A recognition paradigm with words or random shapes was administered to 12 young participants. Memory elicited ERPs were compared to those evoked by control tasks that used similar material. The distribution of the N400 was found to be larger on left frontal than right frontal areas for verbal material, however, this was the case in the control and memory conditions as well. This finding likely reflects the sensitivity of this component to processing verbal material. The LPC amplitude was greater in the non-verbal encoding than the non-verbal control condition, whereas in retrieval it was larger than the control condition for both verbal and non-verbal material. Thus, item-related activity is determined by an interaction between properties of the material and the task instructions. Task-related activity was found for non-verbal material: compared to the control condition, the memory condition of non-verbal material elicited bilateral and right frontal activity in encoding and retrieval processes. No task-related effect was reported with the verbal material. Material differences in eliciting task-related effects are discussed in terms of their relation to elaborative and effortful processes.

J	Stip, E; Caron, J; Renaud, S; Pampoulova, T; Lecomte, Y				Stip, E; Caron, J; Renaud, S; Pampoulova, T; Lecomte, Y			Exploring cognitive complaints in schizophrenia: The subjective scale to investigate cognition in schizophrenia	COMPREHENSIVE PSYCHIATRY			English	Article							EXPERIENCED NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL DEFICITS; QUALITY-OF-LIFE; BASIC SYMPTOMS; NAIVE PATIENTS; RATING-SCALE; MEMORY; DISORDERS; INSIGHT; QUESTIONNAIRE; DYSFUNCTION	While it has become commonplace to test the various components of memory in schizophrenia with paper-and-pencil or in-lab tasks, very little data exist on the subjective complaints of patients regarding their memory. Few instruments have been designed to collect systematically the complaints of patients with schizophrenia. We present a work in progress on the Subjective Scale to Investigate Cognition in Schizophrenia (SSTICS), a 21-item, Likert-type scale that is simple and easy to use. It allows a quantitative approach to the subjective and cognitive dimensions of schizophrenia. Stip constructed the scale based on a questionnaire covering several cognitive domains: memory (working memory, explicit long-term memory), attention (divided, distractibility, alertness, sustained), language, and praxia. We evaluated the psychometric properties of the SSTICS in a population of 114 French-speaking patients in Montreal. Patients were recruited in the community and assessed with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-III-R (SCID), the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), and the Extrapyramidal Symptoms Rating Scale (ESRS). Cognition was measured using the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT) (long-term memory), Controlled Oral Word Association Test (verbal fluency), and Trails A and B. Preliminary analyses showed very good internal consistency for the global score (alpha = 0.88), and alphas varying from 0.57 to 0.72 for the subscales. Stability over time was very good. The principal components analysis accounted for a multiple structure. Correlations between subjective scores and objective cognitive assessment were significant for several domains. Validation of the SS-TICS needs to be completed through further exploration of the factorial structure and testing of the English version. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Patterning within the retinal neuroepithelium is regulated by cell intrinsic as well as cell extrinsic mechanisms. Although the identity of some of the signaling molecules that regulate retinal development is known, the function of many others, especially members of the Writ family, has yet to be characterized in the context of retinal development. We undertook a comprehensive in situ hybridization analysis to examine the expression of Wnt pathway components in the developing and adult mouse neural retina. Our findings confirm and extend previous expression studies in mice and other vertebrates, as we show that Wnt-3, -5a, -5b, and -7b are expressed in the neural retina and that there is a dynamic pattern of Wnt receptor (Mouse frizzled [Mfz]) and Wnt antagonist (Secreted-frizzied-related protein [Sfrp]) gene expression in the embryonic and perinatal neural retina. Moreover, we show that Wnt-13 is expressed in the pigment epithelium overlying the distal part of the eyecup and the ciliary margin and that Mfz-4, -6, and -7 are expressed in different regions within the ciliary margin. To determine where activation of canonical Wnt signaling is occurring in the retina, we examined reporter gene expression in TCF/Lef-LacZ mice and we demonstrate that the highest levels of R-gal activity are found in the ciliary margin, adjacent to and within the Wnt-13 expression domain, implicating Wnt-13 signaling in the development of the ciliary margin and its derivatives.

To explore the normal function of HIP1 in vivo, we created mice with targeted mutation in the HIP1 gene (HIP1(-/-)). HIP1(-/-) mice develop a neurological phenotype by 3 months of age manifest with a failure to thrive, tremor and a gait ataxia secondary to a rigid thoracolumbar kyphosis accompanied by decreased assembly of endocytic protein complexes on liposomal membranes. In primary hippocampal neurons, HIP1 colocalizes with GluR1-containing AMPA receptors and becomes concentrated in cell bodies following AMPA stimulation. Moreover, a profound dose-dependent defect in clathrin-mediated internalization of GluR1-containing AMPA receptors was observed in neurons from HIP1(-/-) mice. Together, these data provide strong evidence that HIP1 regulates AMPA receptor trafficking in the central nervous system through its function in clathrin-mediated endocytosis.

This study evaluates the effects of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and deep hypothermic circulatory arrest (DHCA) on cerebral protection using different steroid administration protocols. Methods: Eighteen (n = 6/group) 4 week-old piglets were divided in three groups. Methylprednisolone (30 mg/kg) was administered intravenously 4 h prior to CPB in Group 1, or added in pump prime in group II. Group III received no steroid. All animals were cooled to 15degreesC followed by 100 min of DHCA, then rewarmed over 40 min and sacrificed 6 h after CPB. Post-operative weight gain, bioelectrical impedance, colloid oncotic pressure (COP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were evaluated. Determination of cerebral trypan blue and immunohistochemical assays of transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta(1) and caspase-3 activities were performed. Results: Post-operative % weight gain (13.0 +/- 3.8 (I) versus 26.4 +/- 9.9 (II) versus 22.6 +/- 6.4 (III), P = 0.02): % bioimpedance reduction (14.5 +/- 8.0 (I) versus 38.3 +/- 13.3 (II) versus 30.5 +/- 8.0 (III), P = 0.003); mean COP (mmHg) (14.9 +/- 1.8 (I) versus 10.9 +/- 2.0 (II) versus 6.5 +/- 1.8 (III), P = 0.0001) and systemic IL-6 levels (pg/ml) (208.2 -1- 353.0 (I) versus 1562.1 +/- 1111.4 (II) versus 1712.3 +/- 533.2 (III), P = 0.01) were significantly different between the groups. Spectrophotometric analysis of cerebral trypan blue (ng/g dry weight) was significantly different between the groups (0.0053 +/- 0.0010 (I) versus 0.0096 +/- 0.0026 (II) versus 0.0090 +/- 0.0019 (III) P = 0.004). TGF-beta(1) scores were 3.3 +/- 0.8 (l) versus 1.5 +/- 0.8 (II) versus 1.5 +/- 0.5 (III), P < 0.05, groups I versus II and I versus III. Remarkable perivascular caspase-3 activity was observed in groups II and III. Conclusion: Different timing of steroid administration results in different inflammatory mediator response. Steroid in CPB prime is not significantly better than no steroid treatment, while systemic steroid pre-treatment significantly decreases systemic manifestation of inflammatory response and brain damage.

One established property of glutamine residues is their ability to act as an amine accepter in a transglutaminase-catalyzed reaction, resulting in a proteolytically resistant glutamyl-lysine cross-link. To examine underlying disease mechanisms we investigated the relationship between polyglutamine-expanded androgen receptor and transglutaminase. We found androgen receptor N-terminal fragments are a substrate for transglutaminase. Western blots of the proteins following incubation with transglutaminase show that several different epitopes of the AR appear to be lost. We propose that this is due to the transglutaminase cross-linking of the AR, which interferes with antibody recognition. Furthermore, HEK GFP(u)-1 cells expressing polyglutamine-expanded androgen receptor and transglutaminase exhibit ligand-dependent proteasome dysfunction; this effect was not observed in the presence of cystamine, a transglutaminase inhibitor. In addition, transglutaminase-mediated isopeptide bonds were detected in brains of SBMA transgenic mice, but not in controls, suggesting involvement of transglutaminase-catalyzed reactions in polyglutamine disease pathogenesis. Our hypothesis is that cross-linked AR cannot to be degraded by the proteasome and obstructs the proteasome pore, preventing normal function. Because of the central role the ubiquitin-proteasome degradation system plays in fundamental cellular processes, any alteration in its function could cause cell death, ultimately contributing to SBMA pathogenesis.

There exist only a few results in the literature and unfortunately, there does not exist any practical criterion. In this brief, the stability of an m-dimensional system is dealt as a minimization problem of the absolute value of its characteristic polynomial over the boundaries of its variables (i.e., on the m unit circles). This minimization problem is solved by using genetic algorithms (GAs). Using GAs we obtain, in general, better results than other methods of minimization (numerical techniques, neural networks, etc.). Numerical examples are presented.

Methods for achieving this goal have been proposed, that range from designing and introducing a bias into a learner to automatically learning the bias. Multitask learning methods fall into the latter category. When several related tasks derived from the same domain are available, these methods use the domain-related knowledge coded in the training examples of all the tasks as a source of bias. We extend some of the ideas presented in this field and describe a new approach that identifies a family of hypotheses, represented by a manifold in hypothesis space, that embodies domain-related knowledge. This family is learned using training examples sampled from a group of related tasks. Learning models trained on these tasks are only allowed to select hypotheses that belong to the family. We show that the new approach encompasses a large variety of families which can be learned. A statistical analysis on a class of related tasks is performed that shows significantly improved performances when using this approach.

J	Guerreiro, MM; Quesney, LF; Salanova, V; Snipes, GJ				Guerreiro, MM; Quesney, LF; Salanova, V; Snipes, GJ			Continuous electrocorticogram epileptiform discharges due to brain gliosis	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						electrocorticography; gliosis; cortical dysplasia; EEG; epileptiform discharges	EPILEPSY; DYSPLASIA; CORTEX	Cortical dysplasia is known to produce continuous epileptiform discharges (CEDs) on electrocorticogram (EcoG) and EEG recordings. The authors studied the incidence of CEDs on ECoGs and correlated this data with pathologic findings. Thirty ECoGs were reviewed that were per-formed on patients with parietal or occipital lobe epilepsy operated on since 1960. CED was classified as: (1) continuous or semicontinuous rhythmic spikes or sharp waves at frequencies ranging from 2 to 8 Hz, and (2) repetitive bursts of rhythmic polyspike activity lasting 2 to 10 s. All nontumoral pathologic specimens were reviewed. Epileptiform activity was classified using the following criteria: focal (one gyrus), regional (two gyri), lobar (three gyri), bilobar, or multilobar. Pathologic examination showed gliosis in eight specimens, focal cortical dysplasia in five specimens, tumoral lesions in eight specimens, and other pathology in nine specimens. CED was found in 11 ECoGs. In seven pathology specimens, significant gliosis was shown, and in the remaining four specimens, a dysplastic lesion was diagnosed. Epileptiform activity was widespread (lobar, bilobar, or multilobar) when gliosis or focal cortical dysplasia was present. Absence of epileptiform activity or a focal/regional distribution was found in tumors and other lesions. These data suggest that extensive gliotic lesions are highly epileptogenic and produce CEDs, which are morphologically undistinguishable from those produced by focal cortical dysplasia.

Patients and Methods: Patients were randomly assigned to 30 Gy of WBRT +/- 5 mg/kg/d MGd. Survival and time to neurologic progression determined by a blinded events review committee (ERC) were coprimary end points. Standardized investigator neurologic assessment and neurocognitive testing were evaluated. Results: Four hundred one (251 non-small-cell lung cancer) patients were enrolled. There was no significant difference by treatment arm in survival (median, 5.2 months for MGd v 4.9 months for WBRT, P = .48) or time to neurologic progression (median, 9.5 months for MGd v 8.3 months for WBRT, P = .95). Treatment with MGd improved time to neurologic progression in patients with lung cancer (median, not reached for MGd v 7.4 months for WBRT, P = .048, unadjusted). By investigator, MGd improved time to neurologic progression in all patients (median, 4.3 months for MGd v 3.8 months for WBRT, P = .018) and in lung cancer patients (median, 5.5 months for MGd v 3.7 months for WBRT, P = .025). MGd improved neurocognitive function in lung cancer patients. Conclusion: The overall results did not demonstrate significant differences by treatment arm for survival and ERC time to neurologic progression. Investigator neurologic assessments demonstrated an MGd treatment benefit in all patients. In lung cancer patients, ERC- and investigator-determined time to neurologic progression demonstrated an MGd treatment benefit. MGd may improve time to neurologic and neurocognitive progression in lung cancer. (C) 2003 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.

The cause of the loss remains unclear. We report that polyclonally activated T cells align along axons and soma of cultured human neurons leading to substantial neuronal death. This occurs in an allogeneic and syngeneic manner in the absence of added Ag, requires T cells to be activated, and is mediated through cell contact-dependent mechanisms involving FasL, LFA-1, and CD40 but not MHC class I. Activated CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cell subsets are equally neuronal cytotoxic. In contrast to neurons, other CNS cell types (oligodendrocytes and astrocytes) are not killed by T cells. These results demonstrate for the first time the high and selective vulnerability of human neurons to T cells, and suggest that when enough activated T cells accumulate in the CNS, neuronal cytotoxicity can result through Ag-independent non-MHC class I mechanisms.

Ovariectomized rats received chronic implants of silastic capsules containing oestrogen and progesterone followed by progesterone removal. In experiment 1, oxytocin antagonist (OTA) was administered to rats to investigate whether intranuclear oxytocin release was necessary for NADPH-d staining. In experiments 2a and b, rats received concurrent treatment with bromocryptine (0.5 mg/day) to suppress endogenous prolactin release, and either systemic prolactin (0.5 mg once daily), or prolactin (2 mug/mul), or vehicle infused twice a day into the third ventricle, or chronic oxytocin infusion (24 ng/day) for 3 days following progesterone removal. Brains were then processed for NADPH-d histochemistry. In experiment 3, the interaction of prolactin and oxytocin on oxytocin mRNA within the SON and PVN was examined. NADPH-d staining in the SON and PVN was reduced by the highest dose of the OTA, and by bromocryptine treatment. Central prolactin and oxytocin replacement completely restored NADPH-d staining in bromocryptine-treated rats. Finally, both bromocryptine and the OTA suppressed oxytocin mRNA expression and prolactin replacement restored expression levels to that of controls. Together, these data suggest that the increased capacity to produce nitric oxide in the SON and PVN during late pregnancy is dependent on prolactin stimulating oxytocin gene mRNA and hence intranuclear oxytocin release.

J	Klein, D				Klein, D			A positron emission tomography study of presurgical language mapping in a bilingual patient with a left posterior temporal cavernous angioma	JOURNAL OF NEUROLINGUISTICS			English	Article						functional neuroimaging; language; bilingualism; brain lesions	2ND LANGUAGE; CORTICAL REPRESENTATION; CEREBRAL ORGANIZATION; BRAIN; WORD; ACTIVATION; LATERALIZATION; GENERATION; HEMISPHERE; MANDARIN	In an attempt to gain a better understanding of how different languages are represented in the human brain, a French-English bilingual patient was studied with positron emission tomography (PET) before undergoing surgery for a left posterior temporal cavernous angioma. When a silent baseline was subtracted from the synonym generation and word repetition tasks in English and in French, peaks in the left posterior temporal region were observed just above and adjacent to the lesion. When word repetition was subtracted from synonym generation, the most significant cortical CBF increases were observed in the left inferior frontal gyrus in both languages. These findings suggest that at least at the single-word level, age of acquisition is not a significant factor in determining functional organization in the brain. Comparison of PET presurgical language mapping and electrical stimulation of the cortex under local anesthesia provided converging evidence to validate the PET findings. The functional imaging literature offers few instances of single-case reports on how the representation of specific linguistic abilities in each language may be related to the presence of a lesion in a bilingual speaker. Such studies offer another perspective for the understanding of the organization of language systems in the brain. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Methods: 34 PP MS patients were divided into two categories: low (< 3 cm(3), n = 18) or high (> 3 cm(3), n = 16) T2 lesion load (LL). An Index of Brain Atrophy (IBA) was calculated and HMRS metabolite ratios were derived from a central brain area centred at the corpus callosum. Results: Patient groups did not differ with regard to clinical characteristics and showed lower mean IBA and mean N-acetylaspartate: creatinine (NAA:Cr) ratios compared to healthy controls. Conclusion: PP patients with low and high brain T2LL have detectable brain atrophy and NAA:Cr reduction compared to healthy controls. In PP MS, T2 lesions alone are insufficient to explain the presence of brain atrophy and decrease in NAA:Cr.

In this study, we examine the effects of representative disease-causing mutations on the subcellular distribution of their corresponding PMP22- and P-0-enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) fusion proteins. In transiently transfected HeLa and 293 cells, we find that wild-type P-0-EGFP and PMP22-EGFP are efficiently synthesized and transported through the secretory pathway to the plasma membrane. The P-0-EGFP and PMP22-EGFP mutants can be classified into several groups: those that are transported to the plasma membrane as in the majority of P-0 mutants; those that are retained in the endoplasmic reticulum as in the majority of PMP22 mutants; and those that are a mixture of the two. In addition, several of these disease-causing mutations are associated with the development of abnormal intracellular cytoplasmic structures that we have previously identified as either intracellular myelin figures or aggresomes. Our studies indicate that different types of PMP22 and P-0 mutations are associated with specific intracellular chaperone proteins, including calnexin and BiP, and that these associations can be altered by glycosylation. These findings indicate that the various P-0 and PMP22 mutants may exert their pathogenic effects in different subcellular compartments and by different mechanisms in the mammalian cell.

J Neurophysiol 90: 271-290, 2003; 10.1152/ jn.01074.2002. Eye-head ( EH) neurons within the medial vestibular nuclei are thought to be the primary input to the extraocular motoneurons during smooth pursuit: they receive direct projections from the cerebellar flocculus/ventral paraflocculus, and in turn, project to the abducens motor nucleus. Here, we recorded from EH neurons during head-restrained smooth pursuit and head-unrestrained combined eye-head pursuit ( gaze pursuit). During head-restrained smooth pursuit of sinusoidal and step-ramp target motion, each neuron's response was well described by a simple model that included resting discharge bias), eye position, and velocity terms. Moreover, eye acceleration, as well as eye position, velocity, and acceleration error (error = target movement - eye movement) signals played no role in shaping neuronal discharges. During head-unrestrained gaze pursuit, EH neuron responses reflected the summation of their head-movement sensitivity during passive whole-body rotation in the dark and gaze-movement sensitivity during smooth pursuit. Indeed, EH neuron responses were well predicted by their head- and gaze-movement sensitivity during these two paradigms across conditions ( e. g., combined eye-head gaze pursuit, smooth pursuit, whole-body rotation in the dark, whole-body rotation while viewing a target moving with the head (i. e., cancellation), and passive rotation of the head- on-body). Thus our results imply that vestibular inputs, but not the activation of neck proprioceptors, influence EH neuron responses during head-on-body movements. This latter proposal was confirmed by demonstrating a complete absence of modulation in the same neurons during passive rotation of the monkey's body beneath its neck. Taken together our results show that during gaze pursuit EH neurons carry vestibular- as well as gaze-related information to extraocular motoneurons. We propose that this vestibular- related modulation is offset by inputs from other premotor inputs, and that the responses of vestibuloocular reflex interneurons (i. e., position-vestibular-pause neurons) are consistent with such a proposal.

J	Feindel, W				Feindel, W			Osler and the "medico-chirurgical neurologists": Horsley, Cushing, and Penfield	JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGERY			English	Editorial Material						Harvey Cushing; Victor Horsley; William Osler; Wilder Penfield; neuropathology; neurosurgical history	NEUROSURGERY; OSLER,WILLIAM	Sir Victor Horsley's lecture "On the Technique of Operations on the Central Nervous System," delivered in Toronto in 1906, set the stage for an appraisal of Sir William Osler as a protagonist for the emerging specialty of neurosurgery. During his time at McGill University from 1871 to 1884, Oster performed more than 1000 autopsies. His pathological reports covered the topics of cerebral aneurysm, apoplectic hemorrhage, vascular infarction, subdural hematoma, meningitis, multiple sclerosis, cerebral abscess, and brain tumor. He wrote about cerebral localization and anatomy and the relationships between the morphological characteristics of the brain and intelligence and criminality. During his continuing career at Philadelphia and Baltimore, Oster published widely on problems in clinical neurology, including monographs on cerebral palsies and chorea as well as chapters on disorders of the nervous system in the first five editions of his popular textbook, The Principles and Practice of Medicine. He became familiar with many of the outstanding figures in medical neurology of his time. Regarding neurosurgery, Osler commended the pioneer operation for a brain tumor in 1884 by Rickman Godlee and the surgery for epilepsy in 1886 by Horsley. In 1907, in discussing the state of brain surgery as reviewed by Horsley, William Macewen, and others, Osler made a plea for "medico-chirurgical neurologists, properly trained in the anatomical, physiological, clinical and surgical aspects of the subject." He played a significant role as a referring physician, mentor, and friend to his young colleague Harvey Cushing (later to become Osler's Boswell), who was breaking new ground in neurosurgery at Johns Hopkins Hospital. Beyond that Osler became an inspiring hero figure for his Oxford student Wilder Penfield, who a few decades later would establish a neurological institute at McGill University where medico-chirurgical neurology would flourish.

J	Nadeau, V; Lamoureux, D; Beuter, A; Charbonneau, M; Tardif, R				Nadeau, V; Lamoureux, D; Beuter, A; Charbonneau, M; Tardif, R			Neuromotor effects of acute ethanol inhalation exposure in humans: A preliminary study	JOURNAL OF OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH			English	Article						ethanol; human; vapors; blood; expired air; neuromotor functions; reaction time; tremor	2 DEVICES; PHARMACOKINETICS; METHYLMERCURY; SYSTEM; TREMOR; BREATH	Ethanol (ETOH) is added to unleaded gasoline to decrease environmental levels of carbon monoxide from automobiles emissions. Therefore, addition of ETOH in reformulated fuel will most likely increase and the involuntarily human exposure to this chemical will also increase. This preliminary study was undertaken to evaluate the possible neuromotor effects resulting from acute ETOH exposure by inhalation in humans. Five healthy non-smoking adult males, with no history of alcohol abuse, were exposed by inhalation, in a dynamic, controlled-environment exposure chamber, to various concentrations of ETOH (0, 250, 500 and 1,000 ppm in air) for six hours. Reaction time, body sway, hand tremor and rapid alternating movements were measured before and after each exposure session by using the CATSYS(TM) 7.0 system and a diadochokinesimeter. The concentrations of ETOH in blood and in alveolar air were also measured. ETOH was not detected in blood nor in alveolar air when volunteers were exposed to 250 and 500 ppm, but at the end of exposure to 1,000 ppm, blood and alveolar air concentrations were 0.443 mg/100m/ and 253.1 ppm, respectively. The neuromotor tests did not show conclusively significant differences between the exposed and non-exposed conditions. In conclusion, this study suggests that acute exposure to ethanol at 1,000 ppm or lower or to concentrations that could be encountered upon refueling is not likely to cause any significant neuromotor alterations in healthy males.

In this paper, a connectionist method that can be used for design recovery in conjunction with more traditional approaches is proposed for analyzing the informal information (comments and mnemonics) in programs. An approach based on artificial neural networks (ANNs) was chosen because of its property of being robust (capable of tolerating noisy inputs), because of its associative memory ability (capable of retrieving a concept given only the context of the input word that originally fired the concept), and because of its generalization power (ability to learn conceptually relevant micro-features of the domain). The proposed approach uses a combination of top down domain analysis (i.e., the creation of a concept hierarchy by a domain expert, to be used in the construction of the training set) and a bottom up approach (i.e., the analysis of the informal information using ANNs). A preprocessing system that extracts the relevant comments and identifier names and transforms them into an input for the ANNs has been developed. Feed-forward neural networks (FNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) were tried. RNN architectures are capable of learning sequences and are able to make use of the word ordering of the sentence. The networks were trained on part of the source code of an existing system and tested on a different portion of the system code. Test results, consisting of coverage and evaluation figures, are presented. They show a remarkably higher accuracy when ANNs, in general, are used as opposed to simple lexical methods. RNNs, in particular, also show higher coverage and accuracy than FNNs. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

In order to assess implicit memory performance for living and nonliving concepts, one group of neurologically intact individuals participated in a cross-form conceptual priming paradigm. In Block 1, pictures primed words while in Block 2 words were used to prime pictures. Across all phases of the experiment, subjects decided whether items represented something which was living or nonliving, and response times were recorded. Results revealed greater priming for living concepts across both blocks. Greater priming for living concepts may have occurred because of increased or prolonged conceptual activation of these concepts. Results are discussed in the context of theoretical accounts of the category-specific impairments observed in brain-damaged populations.

Here we report that extracellular signal-regulated kinase 3 (ERK3), unlike other MAP kinases, is an unstable protein that is constitutively degraded in proliferating cells with a half-life of 30 min. The proteolysis of ERK3 is executed by the proteasome and requires ubiquitination of the protein. Contrary to other protein kinases, the catalytic activity of ERK3 is not responsible for its short half-life. Instead, analysis of ERK1/ERK3 chimeras revealed the presence of two destabilization regions (NDR1 and -2) in the N-terminal lobe of the ERK3 kinase domain that are both necessary and sufficient to target ERK3 and heterologous proteins for proteasomal degradation. To assess the physiological relevance of the rapid turnover of ERK3, we monitored the expression of the kinase in different cellular models of differentiation. We observed that ERK3 markedly accumulates during differentiation of PC12 and C2C12 cells into the neuronal and muscle lineage, respectively. The accumulation of ERK3 during myogenic differentiation is associated with the time-dependent stabilization of the protein. Terminal skeletal muscle differentiation is accompanied by cell cycle withdrawal. Interestingly, we found that expression of stabilized forms of ERK3 causes G(1) arrest in NIH 3T3 cells. We propose that ERK3 biological activity is regulated by its cellular abundance through the control of protein stability.

The first such sequence change was the 677C --> T substitution in methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), but additional sequence changes have been identified in enzymes or transporters for folates. Two recently identified variants are the 1561C --> T (H475Y) mutation in glutamate carboxypeptidase II (GCPII) and the 80A --> G (H27R) change in the reduced folate carrier RFC-1. We examined a group of mothers of spina bifida offspring, and a group of control women, for the above polymorphisms to assess their impact on NTD risk as well as on homocysteine and nutrient (RBC folate, serum folate, and serum cobalamin) levels. The GCPII variant (in the heterozygous state) did not influence NTD risk or metabolite levels; homozygous mutant (YY) women were not observed in our study group. The homozygous mutant (RR) genotype for the RFC-1 gene was not associated with a significant difference in NTD risk (OR = 1.39. 95% CI = 0.55-3.54), but there was a borderline significant (p = 0.065) decrease in RBC folate levels, compared with the HH genotype. However, the combination of the RR genotype for RFC-1 and low RBC folate was associated with a significant 4.6-fold increase in NTD risk (OR = 4.6, 95% CI = 1.47-14.37). Since this small study is the first to demonstrate increased risk for women with the RFC-1 variant for having a child with a NTD, additional larger studies are required to confirm this change as another potential genetic modifier for spina bifida risk.

Here we propose a functional architecture for music processing that captures the typical properties of modular organization. The model rests essentially on the analysis of music-related deficits in neurologically impaired individuals, but provides useful guidelines for exploring the music faculty in normal people, using methods such as neuroimaging.

AP is of interest because it may reflect an atypical organization of sensory representations. Indications are that it depends on both genetic factors and exposure to musical training during childhood, supporting the idea of a sensitive period. Functional and structural neuroimaging studies suggest special roles for working memory and associative memory mechanisms in AP, and results from these studies indicate that there may be structural markers of AP in asymmetries of cortical areas. AP seems to depend on the nervous system's response to experiential, maturational and genetic factors, making it a good candidate model for understanding how these interactions play out in cognitive development generally.

The overexpression of peripherin induces degeneration of spinal motor neurons during aging in transgenic mice and in cultured neuronal cells derived from peripherin transgenic embryos. Here, we investigated whether peripherin is a contributor of pathogenesis in mice overexpressing a mutant superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1(G37R)) gene linked to familial ALS. This was done by the generation and analysis of SOD1(G37R) mice that either overexpress a peripherin transgene (G37R;TgPer mice) or lack the endogenous peripherin gene (G37R; Per(-/-) mice). Surprisingly, upregulation or suppression of peripherin expression had no effects on disease onset, mortality, and loss of motor neurons in SOD1(G37R) mice. These results provide compelling evidence that peripherin is not a key contributor of motor neuron degeneration associated with toxicity of mutant SOD1. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science (USA).

Reduction of glutamate uptake has been described in ammonia-exposed cultured astrocytes, synaptosomes, and in animal models of hyperammonemia. In the present study, we examine the effects of pathophysiological concentrations of ammonia on D-aspartate (a non-metabolizable analog of glutamate) uptake by cultured rat cerebellar granule neurons. Exposure of these cells to ammonia resulted in time-dependent (24% reduction at 24 h and 60% reduction at 5 days, P < 0.001) and dose-dependent (21, 37, and 57% reduction at 1, 2.5, and 5 mM for 5 days, P < 0.01) suppression of D-aspartate uptake. Kinetic analyses revealed significant decreases in the velocity of uptake (V-max) (37% decrease at 2.5 mM NH4Cl, P < 0.05 and 52% decrease at 5 mM NH4Cl, P < 0.001) as well as significant reductions in K-m values (25% reduction at 2.5 mM NH4Cl, P < 0.05 and 45% reduction at 5 mM NH4Cl, P < 0.001). Western blotting, on the other hand, showed no significant changes in the neuronal glutamate transporter EAAC1/EAAT3 protein, the only glutamate transporter currently known to be expressed by these cells. In addition, H-1 combined with C-13-NMR spectroscopy studies using the stable isotope [l-C-13]-glucose demonstrated a significant increase in intracellular glutamate levels derived from the oxidative metabolism of glucose, rather than from the deamidation of exogenous glutamine in cultured granule neurons exposed to ammonia. The present study provides evidence that the effects of ammonia on glutamate uptake are not solely an astrocytic phenomenon and that unlike the astrocytic glutamate transporter counterpart, EAAT3 protein expression in cultured cerebellar granule cells is not down-regulated when exposed to ammonia. Decrease of glutamate uptake in these cellular preparations may afford an additional regulatory mechanism aimed at controlling intracellular levels of glutamate and ultimately the releasable pool of glutamate in neurons.

This may be because lesion location also influences the extent and type of functional disability. We applied an automatic lesion-detection algorithm to 452 MRI scans of patients with relapsing-remitting MS to identify the regions preferentially responsible for different types of clinical deficits. Statistical parametric maps were generated by performing voxel-wise linear regressions between lesion probability and different clinical disability scores. There was a clear distinction between lesion locations causing physical and cognitive disability. Lesion likelihood correlated with the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) in the left internal capsule and in periventricular white matter mostly in the left hemisphere. Pyramidal deficits correlated with only one area in the left internal capsule that was also present in the EDSS correlation. Cognitive dysfunction correlated with lesion location at the grey-white junction of associative, limbic, and prefrontal cortex. Coordination impairment correlated with areas in interhemispheric and pyramidal periventricular white matter tracts, and in the inferior and superior longitudinal fascicles. Bowel and bladder scores correlated with lesions in the medial frontal lobes, cerebellum, insula, dorsal midbrain, and pons, areas known to be involved in the control of micturition. This study demonstrates for the first time a relationship between the site of lesions and the type of disability in large scale MRI data set in MS. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science (USA).

It is well known that the specific binding of [C-11]raclopride to dopamine D-2,D-3 receptors in living striatum is reduced by cocaine and amphetamines, revealing increased competition between endogenous dopamine and [C-11]raclopride for dopamine D-2,D-3 receptors. However. the sensitivity of [C-11]raclopride binding to nicotine-induced dopamine release is less well documented. In order to provide the basis for mapping effects of nicotine, we first optimized reference tissue methods for quantifying [C-11]ractopride binding sites in striatum of living pigs (n = 16). In the same animals, the rate of cerebral blood flow (CBF) was mapped using [150] water. Neither a low dose of nicotine (50 mu kg(-1), iv) nor a high dose of nicotine (500 mug kg(-1), iv) altered CBF in the pig brain, an important condition for calculating the binding of radioligands when using a reference tissue to estimate the free ligand concentration. The methods of Logan and of Lammertsma were compared using the cerebellum or the occipital cortex as reference tissues for calculating the binding potential (PB) of [C-11]raclolpfide in brain. Irrespective of the method used, the mean undrugged baseline pB in striatum (ca. 2.0) was significantly asymmetric, with highest binding in the left caudate and right putamen. Test-retest estimates of pB were stable. Subtraction of Logan pB maps revealed that the low dose of nicotine reduced the pB of [C-11]raclopride by 10% in a cluster of voxels in the left anteroventral striatum, but this effect did not persist after correction for multiple comparisons. The high dose of nicotine (n = 9) acutely reduced pB by 10% bilaterally in the ventral striatum; 3 h after the high nicotine dose, the reductions had shifted dorsally and caudally into the caudate and putamen. Evidently, nicotine challenge enhances the competition between endogenous dopamine for [C-11]raclopride binding sites with a complex temporal and spacial pattern in pig brain, initially presenting in the left ventral striatum.

The pursuit task demanded concurrent planning and execution of unpredictable movements, whereas the tracking task required a highly automated circular movement that could be planned in advance. PKU patients showed significantly poorer motor control in both tasks compared with control participants. Deficits were particularly observed for younger patients (age < 11 years). Differences between control participants and PKU patients were significantly greater in the pursuit task compared with the tracking task, indicating more serious deficits when a higher level of controlled processing is required. Correlations with historical phenylalanine levels indicated a later maturation of the level of control required by the pursuit task compared with the tracking task.

N-acetyl-aspartyl-glutamate (NAAG), an endogenous neuropeptide, blocks NMDA receptors and inhibits glutamate release by activating metabotropic mGluR3 receptors. NAAG is catabolized to glutamate and N-acetyl-aspartate by the astrocytic enzyme glutamate carboxypeptidase II (GCP II), Changes in GCP II activity may be critically linked to changes in glutamatergic neurotransmission especially at NMDA receptors. We examined whether GCP II function is altered by treatment with the noncompetitive antagonist and psychotomimetic drug phencyclidine (PCP) and with the neuroleptics haloperidol (HAL) and clozapine (CLOZ), in corticolimbic brain regions of the adult rat. Chronic exposure to PCP produced significant increases in GCP II protein expression and activity in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus (HIPP). This effect may be explained by a compensatory response to persistent blockade of NMDA receptors. In addition, chronic treatment with neuroleptics upregulated GCP II activity, but not protein expression, in the PFC. In contrast, GCP II activity was decreased after acute exposure to HAL or CLOZ and was not changed after acute PCP treatment. These findings provide support for a role of GCP II function in the control of glutamatergic neurotransmission and suggest that some of the therapeutic actions of neuroleptic drugs may be mediated through their effects on GCP II activity. These results demonstrate that psychotomimetic and neuroleptic drugs modulate GCP II function in brain regions that are widely involved in the neuropathology of schizophrenia.

Its main mechanism of action is thought to be a reduction in the inhibitory outflow from basal ganglia to cerebral cortex. However, recent animal experiments have led to the suggestion that high frequency stimulation of the STN also acts by promoting dopamine release. We tested this hypothesis by performing [C-11]raclopride PET on and off stimulation in six patients with PD and implanted STN stimulators. There was no difference in tracer binding in the striatum between the two testing conditions. We conclude that high frequency stimulation of the STN does not act by increasing dopamine release.

The purpose of this study was to assess the Go or Grow hypothesis using medulloblastoma cell lines in directional migration and invasion assays in monolayer and three-dimensional cultures. METHODS: Time-lapse videomicroscopy was used to continually monitor the directional migration, invasion, and mitosis of individual cells. The mitotic activity observed by time-lapse videomicroscopy was compared with staining for the proliferating cell nuclear antigen Ki-67. RESULTS: A positive correlation exists between the migratory/invasive and mitotic activities of the four medulloblastoma cell lines studied. Within individual cell lines, however, migration and invasion distances are not influenced by the number of cell divisions. Time-lapse videomicroscopy and Ki-67 staining revealed similar trends in mitotic activity between migrating and nonmigrating cells within cell lines. Analysis of cell velocities before, after, and between cell-divisions revealed an increase in cell velocity after cell divisions. CONCLUSION: In the models studied, four medulloblastoma cell lines do not defer cell proliferation for migration across an uncoated surface or invasion of a Type I collagen matrix, contrary to the Go or Grow hypothesis. Migrating and invading cells continue to proliferate and migrate/invade a cell line-dependent distance irrespective of the number of divisions that take place. These findings emphasize the need to evaluate the effect of future therapies on both biological events and, if possible, to identify intracellular signaling proteins that negatively regulate medulloblastoma migration/invasion and proliferation.

Thus far, handwriting recognition systems have been limited to small and medium vocabulary applications, since most of them often rely on a lexicon during the recognition process. The capability of dealing with large lexicons, however, opens up many more applications. This article will discuss the methods and principles that have been proposed to handle large vocabularies and identify the key issues affecting their future deployment. To illustrate some of the points raised, a large vocabulary off-line handwritten word recognition system will be described.

J	Chen, GY; Bui, TD; Krzyzak, A				Chen, GY; Bui, TD; Krzyzak, A			Contour-based handwritten numeral recognition using multiwavelets and neural networks	PATTERN RECOGNITION			English	Article						multiwavelets; multiresolution analysis; neural networks; shape representation	MULTIRESOLUTION	In this paper, we develop a handwritten numeral recognition descriptor using multiwavelets and neural networks. We first trace the contour of the numeral, then normalize and resample the contour so that it is translation- and scale-invariant. We then perform multiwavelet orthonormal shell expansion on the contour to get several resolution levels and the average. Finally, we use the shell coefficients as features to input into a feed-forward neural network to recognize the handwritten numerals. The main advantage of the orthonormal shell decomposition is that it decomposes a signal into multiresolution levels, but without down-sampling. Wavelet transforms with down-sampling can give very different coefficients when the input signal is shifted. This is the main limitation of wavelet transforms in pattern recognition. For the shell expansion, we prefer multiwavelets to scalar wavelets because we have two coordinates x and y for each point on the contour. If we extract features from x and y separately, just as Wunsch et al. did (Pattern Recognition 28 (1995) 1237), then we may not get the best features. In addition, we know that multiwavelets have advantages over scalar wavelets, such as short support, orthogonality, symmetry and higher order of vanishing moments. These properties allow multiwavelets to outperform scalar wavelets in some applications, e.g. signal denoising (IEEE Trans. Signal Process. 46 (12) (1998) 3414). We conducted experiments and found that it is feasible to use multiwavelet features in handwritten numeral recognition. (C) 2003 Pattern Recognition Society. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

Recently, NL1, a novel member of the family, has been identified and shown to be expressed in several tissues both as a membrane-bound and a secreted protein. As a further step to understand the physiological role(s) of NL1 in mouse, we mapped NL1 mRNA expression pattern in embryos and in young animals at postnatal days p1 and p3, and in adult nervous tissue, using in situ hybridization at the cellular level. No expression could be detected in embryos and young animals. In contrast, NL1 expression was evident in adult brain, pituitary gland and spinal cord. In the central nervous system (CNS), NL1 RNA was predominantly found in the ventro-posterior regions, which are mostly associated with vegetative functions. At the cellular level, NL1 RNA was non-uniformly distributed within subpopulations of neurons. In the spinal cord, specific signal was observed in the gray matter. Then, in order to identify putative relevant substrates for NL1, we studied its enzymatic activity towards peptides known to be co-expressed in the NL1-positive domains. Our study showed that NL1 degrades several of these peptides in vitro, the most readily degraded peptides being Bradykinin and Substance P. These results suggest that NL1 is likely to play a critical role in the central nervous system. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The second goal of this study was to assess whether there would be differences in both the pattern of cortisol secretion and emotional state in brain-damaged patients as a function of side of lesion, and localization (anterior vs posterior) of lesion. Eight patients with a left cortical lesion, six patients with a right cortical lesion, four patients with basal ganglia lesions (2 left and 2 right) and ten healthy volunteers were evaluated daily on measures of salivary cortisol levels and subjective feelings of joy and sadness at 0700, 1200, 1600 and 1900 hours over a 15-day period. Patients with cortical brain lesions presented higher cortisol levels and higher scores of sadness at the time of the morning peak (7:00 am), when compared to healthy volunteers and patients with basal ganglia lesions. Laterality of the lesion was not related to cortisol secretion, but frontal damage (anterior lesion) was associated with higher cortisol levels at the time of the morning peak (7:00 am) when compared to more posterior damage. There was no significant correlation between basal circulating levels of cortisol and emotional states in patients and healthy subjects. The results of this study suggest that hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis dysregulation is associated with unilateral injury particularly in frontal areas. These results, obtained in a human population, go along with recent animal studies reporting an implication of frontal regions in HPA activity. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

The reinstatement model is currently used in many laboratories to investigate mechanisms underlying relapse to drug seeking. Here, we review briefly the history of the model and describe the different procedures that have been used to study the phenomenon of reinstatement of drug seeking. The results from studies using pharmacological and neuroanatomical techniques to determine the neuronal events that mediate reinstatement of heroin, cocaine and alcohol seeking by acute priming injections of drugs, drug-associated cues and environmental stressors are summarized. In addition, several issues are discussed, including (1) the concordance between the neuronal mechanisms involved in drug-induced reinstatement and those involved in drug reward and discrimination, (2) the role of drug withdrawal states and periods in reinstatement of drug seeking, (3) the role of neuronal adaptations induced by exposure to drugs in relapse, and (4) the degree to which the rat reinstatement model provides a suitable preclinical model of relapse to drug taking. Conclusions.. The data derived from studies using the reinstatement model suggest that the neuronal events that mediate drug-, cue- and stress-induced reinstatement of drug seeking are not identical, that the mechanisms underlying drug-induced reinstatement are to some degree different from those mediating drug discrimination or reward, and that the duration of the withdrawal period following cocaine and heroin self-administration has a profound effect on reinstatement induced by drug cues and stress.

It is well established that stress induces reinstatement of drug seeking in an animal model of relapse. Here we studied the role of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) in foot-shock stress-induced reinstatement of cocaine seeking. Methods.. Groups of rats were trained to self-administer cocaine (0.5 mg/kg per infusion, i.v., 3 h/day for 9 days) and after ten drug-free days were exposed to extinction and reinstatement test sessions. Each 60 min of extinction was separated by a 30-min time-out period after which the lever and stimulus lights were reintroduced. Rats were given four 1-h extinction sessions on day 1 and then on subsequent days were given two to three 1-h extinction sessions that were followed by a 3-h test for reinstatement. Tests were run every 48 h. In one set of experiments, the effects of inactivation of the prelimbic (PL), infralimbic (IL) or OFC by tetrodotoxin (TTX, 5 ng/0.5 mul per side) on reinstatement induced by foot shock (5 min, intermittent, 1 mA) or priming injections of cocaine (20 mg/kg, i.p.) were determined. In a second set, the effects of infusions of the D1-like and D2-like dopamine receptor antagonists (SCH 23390 and raclopride) were studied using the same methods. Results.. TTX infusions into the PL cortex blocked both foot shock and cocaine-induced reinstatement. TTX into OFC attenuated foot-shock-induced, but not cocaine-induced reinstatement. Infusions into IL were ineffective. Infusions of SCH 22390 (0.25 mug/0.5 mul per side) into either PL or OFC blocked foot-shock-induced reinstatement, but infusions into PL had no effect on cocaine-induced reinstatement. Raclopride (5 mug/0.5 mul per side) had no effect on foot-shock-induced reinstatement in either PL or OFC or on cocaine-induced reinstatement when infused into PL. Neither TTX nor SCH23390 infusions into PL or OFC had any effect on lever pressing for sucrose. Conclusions.. These results suggest that the PL and OFC regions form part of the circuitry mediating the effects of foot shock stress on reinstatement of drug seeking and that the PL region may be a common pathway for cue, drug and foot-shock stress-induced reinstatement of drug seeking.

Lewis (LEW) and Fischer (F344) rats exhibit marked differences in appetitive and consummatory responses to numerous drugs, including psychostimulants. Neurotensin (NT) produces psychostimulant-like actions, which sensitize with repeated exposure, and neuroleptic-like actions; effects that are dependent on the site of microinjection. The aim of the present experiments was to assess the behavioral sensitivity of these two strains of rats to NT receptor activation. Methods. In expt 1, locomotor activity was assessed on alternate days following an ICV injection of NT, [d-Tyr(11)]neurotensin (d-NT; 18 nmol/10 mul), or vehicle (days 1, 3, 5, and 7) in independent groups of LEW and F344 rats. On day 14, locomotor activity was assessed in all rats following an injection of d-amphetamine (1 mg/kg, IP). In expt 2, activity was assessed following injection into the ventral tegmental area of NT, or d-NT, (2.5 mug/hemisphere) or into the nucleus accumbens (2.5 and 5.0 mug/hemisphere). Results. Repeated ICV injections of NT, or d-NT, produced differential behavioral effects in the two strains of rats on days 1-7; activity was initially suppressed in LEW, but less so in F344 rats, following NT. In F344, but not in LEW rats, d-NT produced a significant increase in activity. Neurotensin and d-NT sensitized LEW rats to amphetamine-induced ambulatory and non-ambulatory activity. Except for vertical activity, this effect was weaker or in the opposite direction in F344 rats. When injected into the ventral tegmental area, NT produced an increase in locomotor activity in both strains, an effect that was greater in F344 than LEW rats with d-NT. In the nucleus accumbens, NT marginally decreased activity in both strains, while d-NT produced a significant increase in F344 but not in LEW rats. Conclusions. These results provide empirical evidence that endogenous NT neurotransmission within limbic circuitry differs in F344 and LEW rats.

Eleven patients with acute schizophrenia never treated with neuroleptics were compared to 11 healthy controls. Sleep stages and phasic events (sleep spindles and rapid-eye-movements during REM sleep (REMs) were visually identified. Clinical symptoms were assessed using the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS). Compared to controls, patients with schizophrenia had difficulty initiating sleep, decreased stage 4 duration, reduced rapid eye movement (REM) sleep latency, and normal sleep spindles and REMs densities. Positive symptoms correlated negatively with REM sleep latency. The BPRS total score correlated negatively with REM sleep duration and REMs density. The present results indicate that first episode and neuroleptic-naive patients with schizophrenia have difficulties initiating, but not maintaining, sleep. These results also confirm that the duration of stage 4 and REM sleep latency are reduced in first episode and neuroleptic-naive patients with schizophrenia. The fact that measures of REM sleep correlate with clinical scales of schizophrenia suggests that REM sleep physiology shares common substrates with symptoms of this disease.

Accumulating evidence suggests an important role for the zinc finger transcription factor GATA-4 in hypertrophic agonist-induced cardiac hypertrophy. However, its role in stretch-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy is not known. We employed an in vitro mechanical stretch model of cultured cardiomyocytes and used rat B-type natriuretic peptide promoter as stretch-sensitive reporter gene. Stretch transiently increased GATA-4 DNA binding activity and transcript levels, which was followed by increases in the expression of B-type natriuretic peptide as well as atrial natriuretic peptide and skeletal alpha-actin genes. The stretch inducibility mapped primarily to the proximal 520 bp of the B-type natriuretic peptide promoter. Mutational studies showed that the tandem GATA consensus sites of the proximal promoter in combination with an Nkx-2.5 binding element are critical for stretch-activated B-type natriuretic peptide transcription. Inhibition of GATA-4 protein production by adenovirus-mediated transfer of GATA-4 antisense cDNA blocked stretch-induced increases in B-type natriuretic peptide transcript levels and the sarcomere reorganization. The proportion of myocytes with assembled sarcomeres in control adenovirus-infected cultures increased from 14 to 59% in response to stretch, whereas the values for GATA-4 antisense-treated cells were 6 and 13%, respectively. These results show that activation of GATA-4, in cooperation with a factor binding on Nkx-2.5 binding element, is essential for mechanical stretch-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy.

The IDE chip, positioned very close to the capillary outlet, served as an amplification/detection system. Emerging neurotransmitters at the IDE surface were oxidized at +1.1 V by seven electrodes of the array and then detected by the remaining electrode, poised at +0.0 V There was an amplification effect on the detecting electrode owing to the recycle between the reduced and oxidized forms of the optical isomers at the electrode surface. The detecting "amplification" current response was governed by the applied potential, the detecting electrode position, the number of adjacent electrodes used for recycling and the distance between the oxidative and reductive electrodes. The six chiral forms of the three neurotransmitters were resolved using 25 mM heptakis(2,6,di-o-methyl)-beta-cyclodextrin with a detection limit of -5 muM. The scheme detected a reduced compound at a reducing potential instead of conventional oxidation detection to alleviate electrode fouling and electroactive interferences. The concurrent oxidation/reduction detection of compounds also facilitated and ascertained peak identification as interfering compounds were unlikely to have the same oxidative/reductive characteristics and mobilities as the analytes of interrogation.

Rats were trained in a single session by presenting three paired tones and footshocks. Immediately after training, they were given microinjections Of D-amphetamine or vehicle into either dorsal hippocampus or dorsal striatum. Twenty-four hours later conditioned freezing (measured as cessation of movement by infrared motion detectors) to the experimental context and to the tone were measured separately. Compared to vehicle injections, amphetamine injections into dorsal hippocampus significantly increased conditioned freezing to the context but not to the tone. Injections into dorsal striatum increased conditioned freezing to both the context and the tone. These results converge with findings from lesion experiments suggesting that hippocampus is involved in aversive conditioning with contextual CSs only, and that dorsal striatum is involved in aversive conditioning with both contextual and discrete cue CSs. The functions of the these two structures in relation to that of the amygdala in the mediation of conditioned freezing are discussed. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

In the present study we examined whether these effects were mediated selectively via muOR. Using the same intermittent treatment regimen as for morphine, we found that methadone and etorphine, but not fentanyl, enhanced [D-Ala(2)]-deltorphin-mediated antinociception. However, continuous delivery of fentanyl for 48 hr resulted in augmented deltaOR-mediated antinociception when compared with saline-infused animals. Time course studies confirmed that a 48 hr treatment with morphine was necessary for the establishment of enhanced deltaOR-mediated antinociception. The observed increases in deltaOR agonist potency and deltaOR plasma membrane density were reversed fully 48 hr after discontinuation of morphine injections. Wild-type C57BL/6 mice pretreated with morphine for 48 hr similarly displayed enhanced deltaOR-mediated antinociception in a tonic pain paradigm. Accordingly, the percentage of plasma membrane-associated deltaOR in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, as assessed by immunogold electron microscopy, increased from 6.6% in naive to 12.4% in morphine-treated mice. In contrast, morphine treatment of muOR gene knock-out (KO) mice did not produce any change in deltaOR plasma membrane density. These results demonstrate that selective activation of muOR is critical for morphine-induced targeting of deltaOR to neuronal membranes, but not for basal targeting of this receptor to the cell surface.

Pcdhs are organized into three gene clusters (alpha, beta, and gamma). Within the a and gamma clusters, three exons encode the cytoplasmic domain for each Pcdh, making these domains identical within a cluster. Using an antibody to the Pcdh-gamma constant cytoplasmic domain, we find that all interneurons in cultured hippocampal neurons express high levels of Pcdh-gammas in a nonsynaptic distribution. In contrast, only 48% of pyramidal-like cells expressed appreciable levels of these molecules. In these cells, Pcdh-gammas were associated with a subset of excitatory synapses in which they may mediate presynaptic to postsynaptic recognition in concert with classical cadherins. Immunogold localization in hippocampal tissue showed Pcdh-gammas at some synapses, in nonsynaptic plasma membranes, and in axonal and dendritic tubulovesicular structures, indicating that they may be exchanged among synapses and intracellular compartments. Our results show that although Pcdh-gammas can be synaptic molecules, synapses form lacking Pcdh-gammas. Thus, Pcdh-gammas, and their relatives may be late additions to the classical cadherin-based synaptic adhesive scaffold; their presence in intracellular compartments suggests a role in modifying synaptic physiology or stability.

Here, we investigated the role of two endogenously produced growth factors, the neurotrophins brain-derived neurotrophic factor and neurotrophin-3 (NT-3), in the early progenitor-to-neuron transition. Cultured cortical progenitors express BDNF and NT-3, as well as their receptors TrkB (tyrosine kinase receptor 13) and TrkC. Inhibition of these endogenously expressed neurotrophins using function-blocking antibodies resulted in a marked decrease in the survival of cortical progenitors, accompanied by decreased proliferation and inhibition of neurogenesis. Inhibition of neurotrophin function also suppressed the downstream Trk receptor signaling pathways, P13-kinase (phosphatidyl inositol-3-kinase) and MEK-ERK (MAP kinase kinase- extracellular signal-regulated kinase), indicating the presence of autocrine-paracrine neurotrophin:Trk receptor signaling in these cells. Moreover, specific inhibition of these two Trk signaling pathways led to distinct biological effects; inhibition of P13-kinase decreased progenitor cell survival, whereas inhibition of MEK selectively blocked the generation of neurons, with no effects on survival or proliferation. Thus, neurotrophins made by cortical progenitor cells themselves signal through the TrkB and TrkC receptors to mediate cortical progenitor cell survival and neurogenesis via two distinct downstream signaling pathways.

To better understand the important variables that affect locomotion, we have described in detail the locomotory behavior of C elegans and identified a set of parameters that are sufficient to describe the animal's trajectory. A model of locomotion based on these parameters indicates that reversal frequency plays a central role in locomotion. We found that several variables such as humidity, gravidity, and mechanostimulation influence reversal frequency. Specifically, both gentle and harsh touch can transiently suppress reversal frequency. Thus, reversal behavior is a model for the integration of information from numerous modalities reflecting diverse aspects of the state of an organism.

Brain activity during self-induced sadness and happiness in professional actors	NEUROREPORT			English	Article						functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI); happiness; primary emotions; professional actors; sadness	FUNCTIONAL NEUROANATOMY; INTERSUBJECT VARIABILITY; AFFECTIVE STYLE; FMRI; PERSONALITY; ACTIVATION; ANATOMY; CORTEX; TASK	The question of whether distinct or similar neural substrates underlie primary emotions has not been resolved yet. To address this issue, we used fMRI to scan professional actors during self-induced states of sadness and happiness. Results demonstrated that, relative to an emotionally Neutral state, both the Sad and the Happy states were associated with significant loci of activation, bilaterally, in the orbitofrontal cortex, and in the left medial prefrontal cortex, left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, left anterior temporal pole, and right pons. These loci of activation were localized distinctly within these regions, that is, in different sub-regions. These results suggest that sadness and happiness may be associated with similar brain regions but distinct sub-regions and neural circuits.

We have determined the NMR solution structure of a mutant stem-loop I that mimics the active conformation of the cleavage site internal loop. This structure shares many similarities, but also significant differences, with the previously determined structures of the inactive internal loop. The active internal loop displays different base-pairing interactions and forms a novel RNA fold composed exclusively of sheared G-A base pairs. From chemical-shift mapping we identified two Mg2+ binding sites in the active internal loop. one of the Mg2+ binding sites forms in the active but not the inactive conformation of the internal loop and is likely important for catalysis. Using the structure comparison program MC-SEARCH, we identified the active internal loop fold in other RNA structures. In Thermus thermophilus 16S rRNA, this RNA fold is directly involved in a long-range tertiary interaction. An analogous tertiary interaction may form between the active internal loop of the substrate and the catalytic domain of the VS ribozyme. The combination of NMR and bioinformatic approaches presented here has identified a novel RNA fold and provides insights into the structural basis of catalytic function in the Neurospora VS ribozyme.

Since genetic deficiencies in folate-dependent homocysteine metabolism have been identified in NTD families, we investigated a common variant in betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase (BHMT), 742G --> A (R239Q), as a genetic modifier of NTD risk. Genotypes, nutrient levels, and plasma total homocysteine (tHey) were assessed in 54 patients with spina bifida, 57 mothers of patients, 93 control children, and 86 mothers of controls. The QQ genotype (present in 17% and 7% of the control and case mothers, respectively, and in 12% and 6% of the control and case children, respectively) was associated with a decreased risk of NTD (odds ratios of 0.52 (95% CI 0.13-2.05) for children and 0.37 (95% Cl 0.11-1.22) for mothers). The small sample size limited the statistical power of the analyses, but these decreases, although not statistically significant, are compatible with a protective effect. We did not observe statistically-significant genotype-dependent differences in plasma homocysteine, although women with the QQ genotype did have lower homocysteine; in children, the mean homocysteine level was higher in the QQ group. This inconsistency could be explained by the fact that age is a strong determinant of homocysteine in children and the QQ group was on average older than the other genotype groups. Our study suggests that the Q allele of the R239Q mutation may decrease risk of the condition. This warrants further investigation of its relationship with the development of NTD.

Our purpose was to explore the use of alginate as a new embolic agent that could deliver growth factors and improve results of endovascular treatment of aneurysms. METHODS: We first assessed the potential of alginate as a vector for growth factor delivery by using in vitro binding and elution studies. Lateral wall (n = 68) and bifurcation (n = 4) aneurysms were then constructed in six pigs and 36 dogs. We explored iodine-125 transforming growth factor-beta(1) in vivo alginate delivery in 16 canine aneurysms. We next assessed the effects of adding alginate to gelatin sponges on angiographic and pathologic results at 3 weeks (n = 4 each) in an established model used for the study of recanalization and recurrence. We then explored techniques to control endovascular alginate delivery without protection (n = 4), with the protection of a balloon (n = 4), and with the protection of a single coil (n = 12) at the aneurysm neck in 12 porcine aneurysms, four canine lateral wall aneurysms, and four canine bifurcation aneurysms. The stability of cross-linked alginate was studied after intraoperative injections in eight aneurysms. Finally, to determine the value of the material with or without growth factor in promoting aneurysm healing, we compared angiographic results and neointima formation 3 weeks after intraoperative embolization of canine lateral wall aneurysms with alginate blocks with or without platelet-derived growth factor-BB or transforming growth factor-beta(1) (n = 5 each). RESULTS: Growth factors rapidly eluted from alginate in vitro and in vivo. Alginate coating of sponges led to improved angiographic results and thick neointima formation. Intraoperative alginate block embolization did not lead to recurrence, and growth factors delivered with alginate did not show added benefits. Endovascular alginate embolization was complicated by carotid emboli, and the polymer was unstable once injected, causing delayed neurologic deficits. CONCLUSION: Growth factor delivery can be performed with alginate, but formulation changes and improved endovascular control are necessary before contemplating its use in intracranial aneurysms.

We therefore analyzed hTERT gene dosage in a group of medulloblastomas and other embryonal brain tumors using differential PCR. Amplification of the hTERT locus was detected in 15 of 36 (42%) tumors examined. To correlate gene amplification with message level, we used real-time quantitative PCR to measure hTERT mRNA in 50 embryonal brain tumors. hTERT mRNA was detected in all but one of these cases, and mRNA level correlated significantly with gene dosage (r = 0.82). Log-rank analysis of survival data revealed a trend toward poor clinical outcomes in patients with medulloblastomas containing high hTERT mRNA levels, but clinical follow-up was relatively short and the association was not statistically significant (P = 0.078). Comparative genomic hybridization was used to further analyze the tumor with the greatest bTERT gene dosage and mRNA level, a recurrent medulloepithelioma. bTERT was amplified in the recurrent tumor but not in the primary lesion, suggesting this locus can be involved in tumor progression. Our data indicate that bTERT gene amplification is relatively common in embryonal brain tumors, and that increased expression of hTERT MRNA may be associated with biologically aggressive tumor behavior.

SHR received, from the age of 4 wk, one of the two ACEI (lisinopril or zofenopril, 10 mg.kg(-1).day(-1)) or for comparison, the selective AT(1) antagonist (losartan, 20 mg.kg(-1).day(-1)) in their drinking water for a period of 4, 12, and 20 wk. Age-matched untreated SHR and Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY) were used as controls. B-2 receptor binding sites in most laminae were higher in SHR than in WKY from the age of 8 to 24 wk. Whereas B-1 receptor binding sites were significantly present in young SHR and WKY, they were barely detectable in adult rats. ACEI (16 and 24 wk) and AT(1) antagonist (24 wk) enhanced the number of B-2 without changing B-1 receptor binding sites. However, at 8 wk the three treatments significantly increased B-1 and decreased B-2 receptors in lamina I. It is concluded that 1) the higher density of B-2 receptors in the spinal cord of SHR is not due to hypertension, 2) kinin receptors are regulated differently by ACEI in neuronal and vascular tissues, and 3) aging may have a profound impact on levels of B-1 and B-2 receptors in the rat spinal cord.

The purpose of the study was to investigate the effect of modified neuroleptanesthesia (NLA) with fentanyl/midazolam on the catabolic responses during and after abdominal surgery. Methods. A total of 13 patients undergoing cystoprostatectomy received either modified NLA (n=7) or inhaled anesthesia with isoflurane (ISO, n=6). Glucose and urea production rates were assessed before, during and 1 day after the operation. Plasma concentrations of glucose, urea, lactate, insulin, glucagon and cortisol were also determined. Results. In contrast to isoflurane anesthesia, modified NLA prevented an increase in plasma glucose concentration and glucose production during (P<0.05), but not after surgery. There were no differences in perioperative urea production rates or plasma concentrations of urea, insulin, glucagon and lactate between the two groups. Modified NLA suppressed the intraoperative increase in plasma cortisol concentration as observed in the ISO group (P<0.05). Conclusion.

Brainstem structures responsible for the pathogenesis of RBD are also implicated in cortical activation. To verify the hypothesis that electroencephalogram (EEG) activation will be impaired in RBD, we performed quantitative analyses of waking and REM sleep EEG in 15 idiopathic RBD patients and 15 age- and gender-matched healthy subjects. During wakefulness, RBD patients showed a considerably higher theta power in frontal, temporal, and occipital regions with a lower beta power in the occipital region. The dominant occipital frequency was significantly lower in RBD. During REM sleep, beta power in the occipital region was lower in RBD. This study shows for the first time an impaired cortical activation during both wakefulness and REM sleep in idiopathic RBD, despite an absence of changes on sleep architecture compared with controls. EEG slowing in these patients may represent an early sign of central nervous system dysfunction, perhaps paralleled by subclinical cognitive deficits. The topographical distribution of EEG slowing and possible pathophysiological mechanisms are discussed in light of the known association between RBD and neurodegenerative disorders.

To do this we use a simple mathematical model. The model consists of two delay differential equations (DDE) where the nonlinear relation between the postsynaptic potential and the firing frequency of the neuron population arises from the stoichiometry of the transmitter-receptor kinetics. The parameters of the model refer to the hippocampal feedback system, and the modeling results are compared with corresponding experiments.

To date, this protein was mainly linked to brain, kidneys, and pancreas. Here, we demonstrate for the first time the existence of CaBP8k in the human placental trophoblasts of the human term placenta. Placental Ca2+ transfer from maternal to fetus is crucial for fetal development, although the biochemical mechanisms responsible for this process are largely unknown. In the current study, we have investigated the Ca-45(2+) uptake by human trophoblast cells in correlation with the expression CaBP28k. The expression of CaBP28k was determined by Northern blot analysis, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), immunochemistry, and Western blot analysis. Indeed, Northern blot analysis revealed the presence of a CaBP28k transcript in syncytiotrophoblasts, cytotrophoblast cells, and HEK-293 cells. This was further confirmed by RT-PCR analysis followed by sequencing. In addition, anti-CaBP28k labeling was associated with cytotrophoblast and syncytiotrophoblast tissues in placental tissue sections and in vitro cultured cells. The presence of CaBP28k protein in these cells was confirmed by Western blotting. Cytotrophoblast cells isolated from human term placenta showed differentiation into syncytiotrophoblasts in culture according to the increase in hCG secretion. Both Ca-45(2+) uptake and hCG secretion by trophoblasts increased gradually and were high at Day 4. Taken together, these data suggest that CaBP28k may play a role in Ca2+ transport or cell development in human trophoblast possibly trough Ca2+ buffering.

Critical sentences were manipulated such that they were either unbiased, or biased toward one of two meanings of sentence-final equibiased ambiguous words. Sentence primes were presented auditorily, followed after a short (0 ms) or long (750 ms) interstimulus interval (ISI) by the presentation of a first- or second-meaning related visual target, on which subjects made a lexical decision. At the short ISI, neither patient group appeared to be influenced by context, in sharp contrast to the performance of the NBD control subjects. LHD nonfluent aphasic subjects activated both meanings of ambiguous words regardless of context, whereas RHD subjects activated only the first meaning in unbiased and second-meaning biased contexts. At the long ISI, LHD nonfluent aphasic subjects failed to show evidence of, activation of either meaning, while RHD individuals activated first meanings in unbiased contexts and contextually appropriate meanings in second-meaning biased contexts. These findings suggest that both left (LH) and right hemisphere (RH) damage lead to deficits in using local contextual information to complete the process of ambiguity resolution. LH damage seems to spare initial access to word meanings, but initially impairs the ability to use context and results in a faster than normal decay of lexical activation. RH damage appears to initially disrupt access to context, resulting in an over-reliance on frequency in the activation of ambiguous word meanings. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science (USA).

In two sessions a month apart (T1 and T2),14 subjects were presented with a 3-tone oddball passively, then as a discrimination task. In EEG recordings (32 sites), Nd was calculated by subtraction of the event-related potential elicited by a non-attended stimulus from that after the same frequency-deviant as target. Putative generators in the 180-228 ms latency-range were modelled with brain electrical source analysis and mapped to the modified Montreal brain-atlas. Initial T1-analyses located bilateral Nd dipoles in the superior temporal gyrus (BA22) and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (BA8). Re-test allowed estimates of the temporal and spatial extension of activity. Peak activity occurred 14 ms later. Step-by-step analysis showed that the best spatial fit for the inverse-solutions extended 3-6 mm from the point sources, but for temporal lobe sources this increased 15 mm caudally. The right mid-frontal source (BA10) was rostral and ventral from that in the left superior frontal gyrus (BA8). T1 and T2 dipole strengths were well correlated. Nd measures of controlled attention localised to areas associated with sustained attention, problem-solving and working-memory. Temporal lobe sources were later and more posterior and medial than for automatic change-detection. Frontal Nd sources were more dorsal on the right and more rostral on the left than MMN dipoles reported for the right inferior frontal and left anterior cingulate. The sequence of information processing is reviewed.

In the present study, a pseudopeptide Y-1 receptor antagonist, homodimeric Ile-Glu-Pro-Dpr-Tyr-Arg-Leu-Arg- Tyr-CONH2 (GR231118), also induced Y-1 receptor internalization in human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells. 2 We demonstrated first that both specifically bound radiolabeled antagonist ([I-125] GR231118) and agonist ([I-125][Leu(31), Pro(34)] PYY) underwent receptor-mediated sequestration/internalization in transfected HEK293 cells. 3 Agonist-induced Y-1 receptor internalization was dependent on clathrin-coated pits and was regulated in part by Gi/o-protein activation as revealed by pertussin toxin sensitivity. In contrast, antagonist-induced sequestration of Y-1 receptors was partly dependent on clathrin-coated pits, but independent from Gi/o-protein activation. 4 Exposure to high concentrations of agonist or antagonist caused a 50 and 75% loss of cell surface binding, respectively. The loss caused by the agonist rapidly recovered. This phenomenon was blocked by monensin, an inhibitor of endosome acidification, suggesting that cell surface receptor recovery is due to recycling. In contrast to the agonist, GR231118 induced a long-lasting sequestration of Y-1 receptors in HEK293 cells. 5 Immunofluorescence labeling indicated that following 40 min of incubation with either the agonist or the antagonist, Y-1 receptors followed markedly different intercellular trafficking pathways. 6 Taken together, these findings provided evidence that a pseudopeptide Y-1 receptor antagonist can induce long-lasting disappearance of cell surface receptors through a pathway distinct from the classical endocytic/recycling pathway followed by stimulation with an agonist.

Endothelin-1 (ET-1) is a potent vasocontrictor and mitogenic peptide that is activated in heart failure. There is increasing experimental and clinical evidence in support of an important role of ET-1 in the pathophysiology of heart failure. Manipulation of the activity of ET-1, especially using endothelin receptor blockers, has allowed for the further elucidation of the role of this neurohormonal system and development of novel therapeutic strategies in heart failure. Published clinical studies of these agents to date have involved relatively small numbers of patients with severe heart failure, followed for a relatively short period of time, and have mainly examined surrogate endpoints. Large-scale trials that address to hard clinical outcomes are ongoing and their results forthcoming. A key question that remains concerns whether selective ETA or dual ETA-ETB receptor blockade will be more effective.

Cancers and cancer treatments produce multiple symptoms that collectively cause a symptom burden for patients. These symptoms include pain, wasting, fatigue, cognitive impairment, anxiety, and depression, many of which co-occur. There is growing recognition that at least some of these symptoms may share common biologic mechanisms. METHODS. In November 2001, basic, and clinical scientists met to consider evidence for a cytokine-immunologic model of symptom expression along with directions for future research. RESULTS. The characteristics of cytokine-induced sickness behavior in animal models have much in common with those of symptomatic cancer patients. Sickness behavior refers to a set of physiologic and behavioral responses observed in animals after the administration of infectious or inflammatory agents or certain proinflammatory cytokines. In some cases, these responses can be prevented by cytokine antagonists. A combination of animal and human research suggests that several cancer-related symptoms may involve the actions of proinflammatory cytokines. CONCLUSIONS. Based on the similarities between cancer symptoms and sickness behavior, the authors discussed approaches to further test the implications of the relationship between inflammatory cytokines and symptoms for both symptom treatment and symptom prevention.

Western blots reveal that the monoclonal antibodies recognize a single protein with a molecular weight of approximately 94 kDa, i.e., similar to that of the PER protein of the moth, Anterea pernii. Neurons and their processes are labeled both in the optic lobes and in the central brain. Processes occur in the accessory medulla, the medulla, and proximal lamina, in the central complex, in the non-glomerular neuropil, and in the retrocerebral complex, suggesting that PER-containing neurons form a widely distributed network. Neurons and processes were also labeled in the meso- and metathoracic ganglia. Four to six PER-immunoreactive (ir) neurons with processes in the accessory medulla were double labeled by an antibody against pigment-dispersion factor (PDF), a peptide that is implicated in circadian rhythmicity in Drosophila. In the central brain, projections of fibers labeled by the anti-PER and anti-PDF antibodies were mainly distinct, with overlap only in a few restricted regions.

Rats received amitriptyline (2 mg/kg per day) or saline via intraperitoneal osmotic minipumps for 21 days. Amitriptyline had no effect on any physiological parameters measured, or on free or total plasma tryptophan levels. However, amitriptyline exerted selective decreases of 15% and 17% (P < 0.001) in serotonin synthesis rates in the dorsal and median raphe nuclei, respectively. There was no reduction in any of the projection areas studied, including the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, thalamus, hypothalamus or striatum. The data suggest that chronic low doses of amitriptyline can lead to sustained 5-HT re-uptake inhibition selectively in the raphe nuclei, an effect compatible with tonic activation of 5-HT1A autoreceptors and inhibition of 5-HT synthesis. The failure of chronic amitriptyline treatment to affect 5-HT synthesis rate in the projection areas may ensure an adequate regulation of pain pathways implicated in migraine headache, an effect possibly related to amitriptyline anti-migraine efficacy.

Although severe hyperhomocysteinemia is found in a number of inborn errors of metabolism, mild hyperhomocysteinemia is of concern because of its prevalence in the general population and its effect on the incidence of disease states. A number of genes and common polymorphisms in these genes have been described that can influence total plasma homocysteine levels. Additionally, the power of mouse genetics has been employed to understand the genetic determinants of total plasma homocysteine levels. This review focuses on common polymorphisms and several relevant mouse models and their role in understanding the control of homocysteine levels.

The computed error range was also compared with the degree of disturbance of dipole modeling caused by adding background activity to the spike. Methods: The scalp fields generated by temporal, frontal and rolandic epileptic sources with spatial extent were simulated, and the corresponding 3-dimensional maps of residual variance (RV) were built by computing the RV for a single dipole at each point on a fine imaginary grid in the brain. Single dipole modeling was also performed for the simulated scalp fields after adding real background activity, Results: The brain volume corresponding to a small RV was compact for the frontal sources and the lateral and baso-mesial temporal sources, and large for the anterior and baso-lateral temporal sources. The distribution of dipoles estimated for spikes contaminated with background corresponded to that of the volume of small RV and to spike-amplitude. Estimates were improved by employing inferior temporal electrodes. Conclusions: When evaluating dipole models of epileptic spikes, error ranges can be estimated and they vary considerably from region to region. Significance: This study illustrates the variability of the error in dipole modeling of epileptic spikes. This variability is important when considering the clinical interpretation of modeling results. (C) 2003 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

J	Perlak, D; Jarema, G				Perlak, D; Jarema, G			The recognition of gender-marked nouns and verbs in Polish-speaking aphasic patients	CORTEX			English	Article						psycholinguistics; neurolinguistics; grammatical gender and numeral nouns; verbs; polish	GRAMMATICAL GENDER; INFLECTED NOUNS; LEXICAL ACCESS; MORPHOLOGY; NUMBER; LANGUAGE; REPRESENTATION; SPEAKERS; SYSTEM	In the present study, we investigated the on-line recognition of gender-marked lexical items by three aphasic patients and eighteen matched control participants, all native speakers of Polish. Polish is unique in that it allows investigating grammatical gender across the major categories of nouns and verbs. Patients and their controls were tested using a simple visual lexical decision paradigm in which gender, number and grammatical category were manipulated. Results show that, while response latencies were markedly slower for aphasic patients, gender did not yield differential results in either grammatical category, for both patients and control participants. Plural forms, on the other hand, showed significantly slower response latencies than singular forms in both brain-damaged and unimpaired participants, but only for nouns. We interpret these findings in terms of the inherent vs. contextual, i.e. underspecified, nature of gender and number in the two grammatical categories. This study suggests that while gender can be impaired in off-line performance in aphasia, on-line recognition patterns parallel the performance of non-brain-damaged individuals, confirming the preservation of access procedures in automatic word recognition.

J	Owens, T				Owens, T			The enigma of multiple sclerosis: inflammation and neurodegeneration cause heterogeneous dysfunction and damage	CURRENT OPINION IN NEUROLOGY			English	Article						axons; degeneration; inflammation; multiple sclerosis; oligodendrocytes	CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; EXPERIMENTAL AUTOIMMUNE ENCEPHALOMYELITIS; EXPERIMENTAL ALLERGIC ENCEPHALOMYELITIS; CD8(+) T-CELLS; INTERFERON-BETA; SPINAL-CORD; GLATIRAMER ACETATE; BRAIN ATROPHY; NITRIC-OXIDE; TNF-ALPHA	Purpose of review The demyelinating disease multiple sclerosis has an autoimmune inflammatory component, which has dominated the description of multiple sclerosis. A degenerative component to multiple sclerosis was always apparent, but was underappreciated until recently. Recent work has brought axonal pathology and brain atrophy into new focus. The purpose of this review is to highlight the relative roles played by the inflammatory and degenerative processes in multiple sclerosis pathology. Recent findings In the past year reports have been published to show that early disability and disease progression correlate with axonal damage, and that brain atrophy resulting from axonal loss is a feature of early multiple sclerosis, and is not restricted to the secondary progressive forms of the disease. Inflammatory mediators (CD8 T cells and antibodies) are implicated in axonal damage, and treatment with steroids or anti-inflammatory therapies reduce brain atrophy, pointing to the involvement of the inflammatory response in the initiation of degeneration. Reduced regenerative capability also contributes to degeneration, and inflammatory responses are shown to inhibit the growth and migration of precursor cells for oligodendrocytes. Summary Oligodendrocyte precursors are abundant in multiple sclerosis lesions, but fail to remyelinate. Oligodendrocyte growth and regeneration are probably compromised by the action of growth inhibitory signals and lack of growth stimuli. Inflammatory cells and mediators induce axonal loss as well as demyelination. The degenerative response is therefore an integral and early component of multiple sclerosis.

The Pitx3 homeobox gene is expressed in the MesDA system. We now show that only a subset of MesDA neurons express Pitx3 and that in Pitx3-deficient aphakia mice, this subset is progressively lost by apoptosis during fetal (substantia nigra, SN) and postnatal (ventral tegmental area) development, resulting in very low striatal DA and akinesia. Similar to human PD, dorsal SN neurons (which are Pitx3 negative) are spared in mutant mice. Thus, Pitx3 defines a pathway for survival of neurons that are implicated in PD and that are required for spontaneous locomotor activity.

The present positron emission tomography study demonstrated that area 11 in the right orbitofrontal region, which is directly linked to the medial temporal lobe, is a critical frontal area selectively activated when normal human subjects are engaged in encoding visually presented faces. Furthermore, better face recognition performance correlated with greater cerebral blood flow specifically in this orbitofrontal area.

Dipole localization errors are presented in all four cases, for varying dipole eccentricity and two different values of skull conductivity. Both conventional and reciprocal forward transfer matrices yielded inverse dipole solutions of comparable accuracy. Localization errors were low even for highly eccentric source dipoles on account of the nonlinear nature of the single-dipole solution and the,position constraint. In the presence of Gaussian noise, both conventional and reciprocal approaches were also found to be equally robust to skull conductivity errors.

Although hypokalemia was present in some of these events, we hypothesized that risperidone may have unsuspected electrophysiologic effects predisposing patients to proarrhythmia. In six isolated guinea pig hearts, risperidone elicited prolongation of cardiac repolarization: action potential duration increased from a baseline value of 128 ms +/- 5 to 147 ms +/- 5 (15%) with risperidone 1 muM during pacing at 250-ms cycle length, whereas the increase was only 10%, from 101 ms +/- 2 to 111 ms +/- 4, with pacing at a cycle length of 150 ins. In human ether-a-go-go (HERG)-transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells (n = 16), risperidone caused concentration-dependent block of the rapid component (I-Kr) of the delayed rectifier potassium current with an IC50 for tail block of 261 nM. Risperidone did not block I-KS. Risperidone exerts cardiac electrophysiologic effects similar to those of Class III antiarrhythmic drugs. These effects are observed at clinically relevant concentrations. Because risperidone is metabolized primarily by CYP2D6, these actions likely enhance risk for risperidone-related QT prolongation and proarrhythmia in specific patient subsets (e.g., poor metabolizers and those taking interacting drugs).

We isolated a human cDNA clone, human Mad4 (hMad4), encoding a polypeptide of 209 amino acid residues, exhibiting 90% identity with mouse Mad4. Northern blot analysis shows that hMad4 probe hybridizes to a 3.8 kb message; its expression is highest in quiescent human WI38 fibroblasts. Among tissues, hMad4 mRNA is most abundant in brain, lung, and muscle. Consistent with other members of the Mad family, hMad4 can repress the transactivation activity of Myc/Max heterodimerson an E-box chloramphenicol acteyl transferase (CAT) reporter plasmid; inhibition of both proliferation and clonogenic formation of hMad4-infected cells correlates with the in vitro reporter repression. Moreover, infection of young human fibroblasts induces a replicative senescence-like state. This phenotype was accompanied by s-beta-galactosidase and PAI-1 expression. These results suggest that hMad4 might be an important regulator of replicative senescence in human cells.

To obtain insight into the underlying mechanism(s), the authors investigated cell-specific pathways of [1-C-13] glucose metabolism by high-resolution multinuclear NMR-spectroscopy. Five-day treatment of neurons with 100-mumol/L MnCl2 led to 50% and 70% decreases of ATP/ADP and phosphocreatine-creatine ratios, respectively. An impaired flux of [1_13 C]glucose through pyruvate dehydrogenase, which was associated with Krebs cycle inhibition and hence depletion of [1-C-13]glutamate, [2-C-13]GABA, and [C-13]glutathione, hindered the ability of neurons to compensate for mitochondrial dysfunction by oxidative glucose metabolism and further aggravated neuronal energy failure. Stimulated glycolysis and oxidative glucose metabolism protected astrocytes against energy failure and oxidative stress, leading to twofold increased de novo synthesis of [3-C-13] lactate and fourfold elevated [4-C-13] glutamate and [C-13] glutathione levels. Manganese, however, inhibited the synthesis and release of glutamine. Comparative NMR data obtained from cocultures showed disturbed astrocytic function and a failure of astrocytes to provide neurons with substrates for energy and neurotransmitter metabolism, leading to deterioration of neuronal antioxidant capacity (decreased glutathione levels) and energy metabolism. The results suggest that, concomitant to impaired neuronal glucose oxidation, changes in astrocytic metabolism may cause a loss of intercellular homeostatic equilibrium, contributing to neuronal dysfunction in manganese neurotoxicity.

In the rat brain, bupropion suppresses NE neuron firing activity via the activation of alpha(2)-adrenoceptors and increases that of 5-HT neurons through an indirect action on NE neurons. Twenty-five healthy young male volunteers, with no previous history of psychiatric disorders, were randomized to one of four 7-day regimens: placebo, bupropion (150 mg) once daily, bupropion (150 mg) twice a day, and methylphenidate SR (20 mg daily). To assess the activity of the NE reuptake process, the blood pressure response to intravenous tyramine was determined. A decrease in the systolic pressure response to tyramine was considered evidence of NE reuptake inhibition. Effects on 5-HT reuptake were assessed by measuring whole blood 5-HT concentration, with a decrease serving as an index of 5-HT reuptake blockade. The Profile of Mood States (POMS) scale was used to assess behavioral and psychological changes. Neither bupropion nor methylphenidate altered the tyramine pressor response, in contrast to previous data that demonstrated decreases were obtained with NE reuptake inhibitors. Neither drug modified 5-HT concentrations. However, POMS scores revealed that bupropion at a dosage of 150 mg/day increased composedness, agreeability, and energy, whereas 300 mg/day improved only attention. In contrast, methylphenidate improved only energy. These data provide no evidence that bupropion acts as an inhibitor of NE or 5-HT reuptake in healthy humans. Presumably it enhances synaptic availability of NE by increasing release. Yet, because its behavioral profile is different from that of methylphenidate, it may not share all the biochemical properties of psychostimulants.

IL-1 is a key proinflammatory cytokine in the brain, but the role of IL-18 in the CNS is not yet clear. The objective of this study was to investigate the actions of IL-18 on mouse glial cells. IL-18 induced intracellular expression of IL-1alpha and proIL-1beta, and release of IL-6 from mixed glia. Treatment of lipopolysaccharide-primed microglia with adenosine triphosphate (ATP), an endogenous secondary stimulus, induced IL-1beta and IL-18 release. Although deletion of the IL-18 gene did not affect IL-1beta expression or release in this experimental paradigm, IL-1beta knockout microglia released significantly less IL-18 compared to wild-type microglia. In addition, ATP induced release of mature IL-1beta from IL-18-primed microglia. These data suggest that IL-18 may contribute to inflammatory responses in the brain, and demonstrate that, in spite of several common features, IL-18 and IL-1beta differ in their regulation and actions.

Recent evidence shows that these cells detect and modulate neurotransmission in an activity-dependent fashion. Through G-protein signalling and Ca2+ released from internal stores they can decrease or increase neurotransmitter release, respectively. Thus, they help to establish the level of neurotransmission associated with activity dependent short-term synaptic plasticity. We discuss evidence implicating perisynaptic Schwann cells as being active partners in neurotransmission at the neuromuscular junction, with emphasis on the modulation of short-term plasticity and potential implications for long-term changes.

These P2X receptors have been widely thought to be P2X(2+3) receptors. However, we have recently found that P2X receptor-mediated modulation of sensory transmission in lamina V is not inhibited by trinitrophenyl-adenosine triphosphate (TNP-ATP), a potent antagonist of P2X(1), P2X(3) homomers, and P2X(2 + 3) heteromers. To provide direct evidence for the presence of TNP-ATP-resistant P2X receptors on primary afferent fibers, we examined alpha,beta-methylene-ATP (alphabetameATP)-evoked currents and their sensitivity to TNP-ATP in rat dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons. alphabetameATP evoked fast currents, slow currents, and mixed currents that contained both fast and slow current-components. Fast currents and fast current components in the mixed currents were both completely inhibited by 0.1 muM TNP-ATP (n = 14). Both slow currents and slow-current components in the mixed currents showed broad spectrum of sensitivity to 1 muM TNP-ATP, ranging from complete block (TNP-ATP-sensitive) to little block (TNP-ATP-resistant). TNP-ATP-resistant currents evoked by 10 muM alphabetameATP could be largely inhibited by 10 muM iso-pyridoxalphosphate-6-azophenyl-2',4'-disulphonic acid. Cells with P2X currents that were highly resistant to TNP-ATP were found to be insensitive to capsaicin. These results suggest that TNP-ATP-resistant P2X receptor subtypes are expressed on capsaicin-insensitive Abeta-afferent fibers and play a role in modulating sensory transmission to lamina V neurons.

Despite referral of visceral pain to cutaneous areas, individuals regularly distinguish cutaneous and visceral pain and commonly have contrasting behavioral reactions to each. Our study addresses this dilemma by directly comparing human neural processing of intensity-equated visceral and cutaneous pain. Seven subjects underwent fMRI scanning during visceral and cutaneous pain produced by balloon distention of the distal esophagus and contact heat on the midline chest. Stimulus intensities producing nonpainful and painful sensations, interleaved with rest periods, were presented in each functional run. Analyses compared painful to nonpainful conditions. A similar neural network, including secondary somatosensory and parietal cortices, thalamus, basal ganglia, and cerebellum, was activated by visceral and cutaneous painful stimuli. However, cutaneous pain evoked higher activation bilaterally in the anterior insular cortex. Further, cutaneous but not esophageal pain activated ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, despite higher affective scores for visceral pain. Visceral but not cutaneous pain activated bilateral inferior primary somatosensory cortex, bilateral primary motor cortex, and a more anterior locus within anterior cingulate cortex. Our results reveal a common cortical network subserving cutaneous and visceral pain that could underlie similarities in the pain experience. However, we also observed differential activation patterns within insular, primary somatosensory, motor, and prefrontal cortices that may account for the ability to distinguish visceral and cutaneous pain as well as the differential emotional, autonomic and motor responses associated with these different sensations.

In an attempt to standardize culturing methods for all neuronal cell types in the embryo, we evaluated a commercial medium without serum and used similar times for trypsinization and tested different surfaces for plating. In 1 day, using one method and a single medium, it is possible to produce robust E17 cultures of dorsal root ganglia (DRG), cerebellum, and enteric plexi. Allowing the endogenous glial cells to repopulate the cultures saves time compared with existing techniques, in which glial cells are added to cultures first treated with antimitotic agents. It also ensures that all the cells present in vivo will be present in the culture. Myelination commences after approximately 2 weeks in culture for dissociated DRG and 3-4 weeks in cerebellar cultures. In enteric cultures, glial wrapping of the enteric neurons is seen after 3 weeks (2 weeks in ascorbic acid), suggesting that basal lamina production is important even for glial ensheathment in the enteric nervous system. No overgrowth of fibroblasts or other nonneuronal cells was noted in any cultures, and myelination of the peripheral nervous system and central nervous system cultures was very robust.

Since several peripheral influences could be involved in sleep-wake regulation and the genesis of rhythmic jaw movements, the authors have reviewed the relevant literature to facilitate understanding of mechanisms possibly involved in SB genesis. Various animal and human studies indicate that during either wakefulness or anesthesia, orofacial sensory inputs (eg, from periodontium, mucosa, and muscle) could influence jaw muscle activity. However, the role of these sensory inputs in jaw motor activity during sleep is unclear. Interestingly, during sleep, the jaw is usually open due to motor suppression; tooth contact most likely occurs in association with sleep arousal. Recent physiologic evidence supports an association between sleep arousal and SB; a sequential change from autonomic (cardiac) and brain cortical activities precede SB-related jaw motor activity. This suggests that the central and/or autonomic nervous systems, rather than peripheral sensory, factors, have a dominant role in SB genesis. However, some peripheral sensory factors may exert an influence on SB through their interaction with sleep-wake mechanisms. The intent of this review is to integrate various physiologic concepts in order to better understand the mechanisms underlying the genesis of SB.

Methods: Seventeen young (18-38 years) and 9 older healthy individuals (67-83 years), as well as 5 patients 2 to 20 months following surgery (37-61 years), were studied. They sidestepped laterally with eyes closed toward memorized targets located 1.25 m to their right or left. They stopped when they judged that they were in front of the target. The position of head and body markers was recorded in three dimensions with a six-camera Vicon 512 system (Oxford Metrics Ltd., Oxford, UK). Navigation errors were (1) distance error, the distance between the end target and a perpendicular line drawn from the sternum to the plane of targets, and (2) deviation, the angle formed between the line joining the initial and end targets and the line joining the subject's shoulders. Results: Mean distance error was 20.9 +/- 22.0 cm in patients, 29.6 +/- 30.3 cm in young healthy subjects, and -1.7 +/- 18.4 cm in older subjects (p < .01 compared with young subjects). Mean deviation was symmetric and 8&DEG; and -3&DEG; in healthy young and older subjects, respectively. In contrast, patients had a significantly larger deviation when navigating toward the side of their lesion than the intact side (13&DEG; &PLUSMN; 9&DEG; versus 3&DEG; &PLUSMN; 9&DEG;; P < .01). Conclusions: Our results suggest that patients with vestibular deficits have impaired ability to control body rotations when walking sideways without vision toward the side of their vestibular lesion.

We used two different HCMV genome modification strategies to test this hypothesis in acutely infected cells. We report the following: (i) the CREs do not govern basal levels of MIE promoter activity at a high or low multiplicity of infection (MOI) in human foreskin fibroblast (HIFF)- or NTera2-derived neuronal cells; (ii) serum and virion components markedly increase MIE promoter-dependent transcription at a low multiplicity of infection (MOI), but this increase is not mediated by the CREs; (iii) forskolin stimulation of the cAMP signaling pathway induces a two- to threefold increase in MIE RNA levels in a CRE-specific manner at a low MOI in both HFF- and NTera2-derived neuronal cells; and (iv) the CREs do not regulate basal levels of HCMV DNA replication at a high or low MOI in HFF. Their presence does impart a forskolin-induced increase in viral DNA replication at a low MOI but only when basal levels of MIE promoter activity are experimentally diminished. In conclusion, the 19-bp-repeat CREs add to the robust MIE promoter activity that occurs in the acutely infected stimulated cells, although the CREs' greater role may be in other settings.

Evidence suggests that HE is the consequence of the accumulation in brain of neurotoxic and/or neuroactive substance including ammonia, manganese, aromatic amino acids, mercaptans, phenols, short-chain fatty acids, bilirubin and a variety of neuroactive medications prescribed as sedatives to patients with liver failure. Brain ammonia concentrations may attain levels in excess of 2 mM, concentrations which are known to adversely affect both excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission as well as brain energy metabolism. Manganese exerts toxic effects on dopaminergic neurones. Prevention and treatment of HE continues to rely heavily on the reduction of circulation ammonia either by reduction of gut production using lactulose or antibiotics or by increasing its metabolism using L-ornithine-L-aspartate. No specific therapies have so far been designed to reduce circulation concentrations of other toxins. Liver assist devices offer a potential new approach to the reduction of circulating neurotoxins generated in liver failure. In this regard, the Molecular Absorbents Recirculating System (MARS) appears to offer distinct advantages over hepatocyte-based systems.

The safety and efficacy of early steroid withdrawal were determined in patients treated with either tacrolimus or microemulsion cyclosporin A (micro-CsA). The primary outcome was the proportion of patients who were steroid-free 1 year posttransplantation. From the seven Canadian adult liver transplant centers, 143 patients were randomly allocated oral treatment with either tacrolimus (n = 71) or micro-CsA (n = 72), together with corticosteroids and azathioprine. Eligibility criteria for steroid withdrawal included freedom from acute rejection for a minimum of 3 months, and prednisone less than or equal to0.15 mg/kg/d. In eligible patients, the daily steroid dose was reduced by 2.5 mg each month until complete discontinuation was achieved. At 1 year after transplantation, 75% of the tacrolimus patients and 63% of the micro-CsA patients were steroid-free (P =.20). Of all of the patients who became eligible for steroid withdrawal, steroid discontinuation was achieved in over 80%. One-year patient survival was 97% with tacrolimus and 89% with micro-CsA (P =.052). Graft survival was 97% and 86%, respectively (P =.017). The overall incidence of acute rejection during the first year was 35% with tacrolimus and 43% with micro-CsA (P =.26). There was no difference in survival, acute rejection, or rate of steroid withdrawal when adjusting for hepatitis C. All acute rejection episodes experienced during steroid withdrawal were steroid-responsive. Steroid-resistant rejection occurred in 5.6% of the tacrolimus and 9.7% of the micro-CsA patients. One patient, in the micro-CsA group, experienced refractory rejection. Chronic rejection was not observed in either group. The toxicity profiles were similar. Postoperative serum creatinine levels were similar, and dialysis was required in less than 10% of patients in each group. Infectious complications were similar in both groups. Neurotoxicity was a serious adverse event in 13% and 10% of patients receiving tacrolimus and micro-CsA, respectively. Early steroid withdrawal is safe and effective after liver transplantation using either tacrolimus plus azathioprine or micro-CsA plus azathioprine immunoprophylaxis.

Since fingerpads serve as a coupling element between the hand and the objects, the investigation of the dynamic coupling between fingertip and subjects could provide important information for the understanding of the pathomechanics of these neural and vascular diseases. In the present study, the nonlinear and time-dependent force responses of fingertips during dynamic contact have been investigated experimentally and theoretically. Four subjects (2 male and 2 female) with an average age of 24 years participated in the study. The index fingers of right and left hands of each subject were compressed using a flat platen via a micro testing machine. A physical model was proposed to simulate the nonlinear and time-dependent force responses of fingertips during dynamic contact. Using a force relaxation test and a fast loading test at constant loading speed, the material/structural parameters underlying the proposed physical model could be identified. The predicted rate-dependent force/displacement curves and time-histories of force responses of fingertips were compared with those measured in the corresponding experiments. Our results suggest that the force responses of fingertips during the dynamic contacts are nonlinear and time-dependent. The physical model was verified to characterize the nonlinear, rate-dependent force-displacement behaviors, force relaxations, and time-histories of force responses of fingertips during dynamic contact.

In the present study the effectiveness of such immunization with myelin was compared to that of a combination of two axon growth inhibitors in myelin, Nogo-66 (the 66-amino-acid inhibitory region of Nogo-A) and myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG). The effectiveness of two adjuvants, IFA and aluminum hydroxide (Alum), was also compared, the latter being one that can be used in humans. In addition, larger dorsal overhemisections were made at the lower thoracic level, which resulted in a larger scar. These studies were carried out in SJL/J mice, a mouse strain that is susceptible to autoimmune experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE). None of the immunized mice developed EAE. Long-distance axon regeneration and sprouting of the corticospinal tract was seen in myelin and Nogo-66/MAG immunized mice. Alum was as effective or better than IFA as the adjuvant. Overall, the robustness of axon growth and sprouting was greater in mice immunized with myelin. The abundance of this growth was less than in our earlier work in which smaller lesions were made, pointing to the possible influence of inhibitors in the scar. This work shows, however, that axon growth inhibitors in myelin can be selectively blocked using this immunization approach to promote long-distance axon regeneration in the spinal cord.

We mapped a third locus associated with ADH, HCHOLA3 at 1p32, and now report two mutations in the gene PCSK9 (encoding proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9) that cause ADH. PCSK9 encodes NARC-1 (neural apoptosis regulated convertase), a newly identified human subtilase that is highly expressed in the liver and contributes to cholesterol homeostasis.

Subjects were scanned in the following four conditions: (1) contour-defined animals with natural movements (running), (2) motion-defined animals in which the contours were removed and dots were placed on the limbs and moving parts (BM; running); (3) drifting static animal shapes (contours); and (4) drifting dots. The results demonstrate that the perception of BM involves the superior frontal gyrus, the precuneus, the fusiform, the lingual and the medial temporal gyri, the inferior parietal lobe, the hippocampal and parahippocampal areas, and the cerebellum. In addition, the anterior cingulate cortex and the amygdala were significantly activated. The perception of contour-defined shapes produced significant elevation of rCBF in some areas similar to the BM condition, namely the fusiform, medial occipital, medial temporal, and lingual gyri. Only the occipital pole and the inferior temporal cortex were specifically activated by contour-defined shapes. These results are congruent with previous findings that the dorsal visual pathway is important for the perception of BM. They further support psychophysical results showing that contour and BM cues for motion-defined animal shapes are processed by independent channels. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science (USA).

Importantly, there is little consistency among the results of these studies. Hypothesizing that individual differences may account for the discrepancies among these investigations, we conducted two functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies to identify the neural circuitry underlying this basic emotion. In these two methodologically identical studies, two different groups (n = 10 for each study) of the first of these studies, sadness was correlated with significant loci of activation in the anterior temporal pole and insula (P < 0.05, corrected). In the second study, however, sadness was correlated with significant activation in the orbitofrontal and medial prefrontal cortices (P < 0.05, corrected). In addition, individual statistical parametric maps revealed a marked degree of interindividual variability in both Study 1 and Study 2. These results strongly support the view that individual differences may be responsible for the inconsistencies found in the literature regarding the neural substrates of sadness and of other basic emotions. These findings also suggest that individual data should be reported in addition to group data, because they provide useful information about the variability present in the subjects investigated and, thus, about the typicality and generalizability of the results.

Several quantitative trait loci (QTL) have been identified for cocaine-induced locomotor activation using the AXB/BXA recombinant inbred series of strains derived from the A/J (A) and C57BL/6J (136). The aim of the present study was to conduct an independent analysis of cocaine-induced activation in the AcB/BcA recombinant congenic strains. The AcB/BcA RC series consists of 37 inbred strains derived from reciprocal backcrosses between the A and 136, followed by systematic inbreeding. Locomotor activity was measured in a computerized open-field apparatus following intraperitoneal administration of saline and cocaine (20 mg/kg). Linkage maps constructed with 625 informative microsatellite markers were used to identify chromosomal regions associated with cocaine difference scores. Significant (P < 0.00001) regions were identified on chromosomes 1 (13-25.7 and 36.9-58.5 cM), 5 (1-28 and 84-86 cM), 6 (7-26.35 cM), 7 (9.4-27.8 cM), 9 (9-28 cM), 13 (21-37 cM), 16 (36-66 cM), 17 (22.5-24.5 cM) and 18 (45-48 cM). Multiple regression analysis demonstrated that a subset of four markers, including D5Mit1 82 (24 cM), D5Mit409 (84 cM), D7Mit83 (26.5 cM) and D13Mit54 (35 cM), accounted for 90% of the genetic variance in cocaine difference scores. The results of the present study provide confirmation for a number of QTL on chromosomes 1, 5, 6, 9,16 and 17 which were previously identified in the recombinant inbred AXB/BXA and BXD strains that share a common B6 ancestor.

Intracerebral implantation of engineered cells encapsulated in a semipermeable polymer membrane constitutes one way to deliver bioactive substances unable to cross the blood-brain barrier while avoiding the need for long-term immuno suppression. Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) has shown trophic effects on DA neurons but effective and sustained delivery within the brain parenchyma remains problematic. The long-term efficacy and late complications of a xenotransplant approach utilizing GDNF-expressing encapsulated baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells were examined. Each of five MPTP-lesioned parkinsonian cynomolgus monkeys received five devices containing active or inert cells grafted bilaterally in the striatum in a two-stage procedure 9 months apart and animals were sacrificed 4 months later for analyses. No definite motor benefit was observed, DA levels were comparable between GDNF- and control cell-implanted striata, and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) immunoreactivity in the substantia nigra showed no consistent recovery. Cell viability and GDNF synthesis in the explanted devices were negligible. The brain tissue surrounding all implants showed an intense immune reaction with prominent "foreign body" inflammatory infiltrates. Membrane biophysics, the cell type used, and the extended period of time the devices remained in situ may have contributed to the negative outcome and should be addressed in future investigations using this approach.

Our previous studies showed that besides linear addition of MLRs, other phenomena, mainly related to the adaptive properties of neural sources, interact in a complex way to generate the SSRs recorded from the temporal cortex of awake rats. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of the inhalational general anesthetic, isoflurane, on MLRs and SSRs at several repetition rates (30-60 Hz) recorded from the temporal cortex of rats. Auditory evoked potentials were obtained by means of epidural electrodes in the awake condition and during anesthesia at three isoflurane concentrations (0.38, 0.76 and 1.13 vol.% in oxygen). MLR latency significantly increased during anesthesia in a concentration-dependent manner, while MLR amplitude, even when significantly attenuated with respect to the mean awake baseline value, failed to correlate with isoflurane concentration. SSRs decreased in amplitude and increased in phase during anesthesia in a concentration- dependent manner and the anesthetic-induced decrease of SSR amplitude appeared to be higher than the corresponding MLR attenuation. SSR prediction curves synthesized,by linear addition of MLRs failed to predict SSRs in both amplitude and phase. Moreover, phase discrepancies proved to be higher during anesthesia. Our results suggest that MLRs and SSRs recorded from the temporal cortex of the rat exhibit differential sensitivity to isoflurane and that isoflurane could enhance the role of rate-dependent effects in SSR generation.

There are significant gender differences in schizophrenia with male and female individuals differing in the age of onset, course and outcome of the disorder. In order to assess whether the behavioral effects of nVH lesions extend to or are different in female rats, we investigated spontaneous locomotion, grooming, social interactions and spatial memory in male and female rats post-pubertally at postnatal day (P) 56 following bilateral ibotenic acid of the ventral hippocampus at P7. The spontaneous locomotor activity in a novel environment of both male and female nVH lesioned rats was significantly enhanced compared to their respective sham-operated controls. In tests of social interactions, the number of encounters was significantly decreased in female lesioned rats, whereas the male nVH lesioned. rats showed a significantly reduced duration of active social interactions. Furthermore, Morris water maze test showed a deficit of spatial learning/memory in only male lesioned rats with significant decrease in the latency to find hidden platform. These results suggest that while nVH lesions affect post-pubertal behavior in both sexes of rats, the males appear to be affected to a greater extent than the females underscoring the influence of sex differences in the development of behaviors in the nVH lesioned animals.

NFH-LacZ transgenic mice could be distinguished from controls in the SHIRPA neurological battery by the appearance of action tremor and hindlimb clasping and a lower body weight. Despite normal exploratory activity and spatial learning, NFH-LacZ transgenic mice were deficient in stationary beam, coat-hanger, and rotorod tests of motor coordination. These results are concordant with neuropathological findings in spinal motoneurons and the cerebellum and indicate that despite the absence of paralysis, these transgenic mice may serve as an experimental model of the early stage of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

ChAT-immunoreactive cell bodies and their emerging processes, located at birth in the lateral part of neostriatum, progressively pervaded the whole region, to give rise to an extremely dense axonal network. As visualized and measured in single thin sections, at postnatal (P) ages P8, P16, and P32, the intrinsic and relational features of ChAT-immunostained profiles of axon varicosities in the lateral and medial parts of neostriatum were similar to those previously described in the adult. At the three postnatal ages, the immunoreactive profiles were comparable in shape, size, and vesicular content, and displayed one or more mitochondria with increasing frequency (from 10% at P8 to 29% at P32). The proportion which showed a synaptic junction was low at the three ages (8-16%), indicating an average synaptic incidence of 22% for whole varicosities after stereological extrapolation. The observed junctions were relatively small, mostly symmetrical, and made with dendritic spines or branches. The frequency of synapses on spines versus branches increased with age, from 20% at P8 to almost 60% at P32. Thus, the relational features of the neostriatal ACh innervation were similar to adult as soon as it appeared, as previously observed to be the case in the developing cerebral cortex. The diffuse mode of transmission may therefore be characteristic of both ACh interneurons (neostriatum) and projection neurons (cerebral cortex) in the CNS, and could be determining their functional properties during development as well as at maturity.

Absent in metazoans, this pathway is an attractive target for nontoxic herbicides and drugs. Escherichia coli expresses two shikimate dehydrogenase paralogs, the NADP-specific AroE and a putative enzyme YdiB. Here we characterize YdiB as a dual specificity quinate/shikimate dehydrogenase that utilizes either NAD or NADP as a cofactor. Structures of AroE and YdiB with bound cofactors were determined at 1.5 and 2.5 Angstrom resolution, respectively. Both enzymes display a similar architecture with two alpha/beta domains separated by a wide cleft. Comparison of their dinucleotide-binding domains reveals the molecular basis for cofactor specificity. Independent molecules display conformational flexibility suggesting that a switch between open and closed conformations occurs upon substrate binding. Sequence analysis and structural comparison led us to propose the catalytic machinery and a model for 3-dehydroshikimate recognition. Furthermore, we discuss the evolutionary and metabolic implications of the presence of two shikimate dehydrogenases in E. coli and other organisms.

We investigated a possible role of the gene involved in WFS (WFS1) in the neurobiology of suicide and the potential modulatory effect on traits associated to suicidal behavior. Genetic variation at WFS1 (H611R, R456H, and I333V) was investigated in Ill suicide victims and 129 normal controls. Possible effects on psychopathology and behavioral traits were investigated in a subsample of suicide cases (N = 31) for whom phenotyping was carried out by means of structured psychiatric interviews and questionnaires adapted for psychological autopsies. We found a significantly higher frequency of the 611R/611R genotype in suicide completers as compared to controls (chi(2) = 19.21, df=2, P = 0.001). Suicide completers with this genotype had higher scores on measures of impulsivity (t = -3.15, df = 15.3, P = 0.006); novelty seeking (NS) (t = -3.35, df = 13.8, P = 0.005); and conversely, lower scores of persistence (t = 2.4, df = 16.6, P = 0.028). Scores of impulsivity and NS remained higher in subjects with the associated genotype after adjusting for age, gender, and psychopathology. These results suggest a role for WFS1 in the pathophysiology of impulsive suicide, and are consistent with previous clinical reports suggesting an increased risk of suicidal behavior in WFS homozygotes and heterozygotes. However, these findings are preliminary and should be confirmed in independent samples. (C) 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

J	Glenn, MJ; Nesbitt, C; Mumby, DG				Glenn, MJ; Nesbitt, C; Mumby, DG			Perirhinal cortex lesions produce variable patterns of retrograde amnesia in rats	BEHAVIOURAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						perirhinal cortex; water maze; retrograde amnesia; spatial memory; consolidation; rats	POSTRHINAL CORTICES; FORNIX TRANSECTION; NEUROTOXIC LESIONS; OBJECT RECOGNITION; SPATIAL MEMORY; HIPPOCAMPAL-FORMATION; PLACE MEMORY; CONSOLIDATION; PROJECTIONS; MONKEY	Two experiments examined the contribution of the perirhinal cortex (PRh) to retrograde memory for the location of a platform in a water maze. In a previous study, we found that electrolytic lesions of the PRh produced retrograde amnesia, without a temporal gradient, for water-maze problems acquired 4 weeks and 2 days before surgery [Behav. Brain. Res. 114 (2000) 119]. In Experiment 1, we used the same mixed design as in our previous report (time of learning was a within-subjects factor), but PRh lesions were made by aspiration. Contrary to our earlier report, these PRh rats displayed good retention of both platform locations. Combined, these findings indicate that the lesion method may contribute importantly to the pattern of deficits observed. Experiment 2 was conducted similar to Experiment 1, except that a completely between-subjects design was used (time of learning was a between-subjects factor). Rats that received PRh lesions approximately 2 days after the last training session displayed impaired retention of the platform's location, whereas rats that received PRh lesions 4 weeks after training did not. This finding of a temporally graded retrograde amnesia is consistent with our earlier report, and further suggests that the involvement of the PRh in the retention of water-maze problems is time-limited. However, also consistent with our earlier report, the PRh-lesioned rats in Experiment 2 that displayed a retention deficit rapidly reacquired the task. This finding, combined with the negative findings in Experiment 1, suggests that the contribution of the PRh to retrograde memory for platform locations is subtle and may not be due to impaired spatial memory abilities. Additionally, the conflicting results of Experiments 1 and 2 underscore the importance of the design employed in studies of retrograde amnesia in animals. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

We addressed whether glioma cells use the astrocyte environment to modulate matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2), a proteolytic enzyme implicated in the invasiveness of glioma cells. We found that astrocytes in culture produce significant amounts of the pro-form of MMP-2 but undetectable levels of active MMP-2. However, after coculture with the U251N glioma line, astrocyte pro-MMP-2 was converted to the active form. The mechanism of pro-MMP-2 activation in glioma - astrocyte coculture was investigated and was found to involve the urokinase- type plasminogen activator (uPA) - plasmin cascade whereby uPA bound to uPA receptor ( uPAR), leading to the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin. The latter cleaved pro-MMP-2 to generate its active form. Furthermore, key components (i.e., uPAR, uPA, and pro-MMP-2) were contributed principally by astrocytes, whereas the U251N glioma cells provided plasminogen. In correspondence with this biochemical cascade, the transmigration of U251N cells through Boyden invasion chambers coated with an extracellular matrix barrier was increased significantly in the presence of astrocytes, and this was inhibited by agents that disrupted the uPA - plasmin cascade. Finally, using resected human glioblastoma specimens, we found that tumor cells, but not astrocytes, expressed plasminogen in situ. We conclude that glioma cells exploit their astrocyte environment to activate MMP-2 and that this leads to the increased invasiveness of glioma cells.

Material and methods - The three-dimensional kinematics of the upper limb were quantified during unconstrained reaching movements in seven healthy individuals and in 15 stroke patients. Nine patients were followed-up. Individual observations were correlated with anatomical and functional brain imaging described elsewhere (Feydy et al. Stroke 2002;33 :1610). Results - Healthy subjects used mainly elbow extension and shoulder flexion, scaled to movement distance. Patients with hemiparesis because of stroke used different patterns of joint recruitment with different scaling rules. Patients with the greatest impairment compensated by recruiting extra degrees of freedom, particularly trunk bending. Improvement was because of a restoration towards a normal movement pattern (recovery) and/or to a reinforcement of compensation, which led to a poorer outcome. Conclusion - Individual behavioural data are necessary to discuss the mechanisms of functional improvement following stroke with respect to recovery and/or compensation.

The locations of acute time-loss injuries or neurologic injures were coded as head and neck, upper extremity (shoulder to hand), or lower extremity (hip to foot). Poisson regression-based generalized estimating equations were used to estimate rate ratios and 95% confidence intervals. Injury rates were higher during games as compared with practice periods (for the head and neck, rate ratio (RR) = 9.75 (95% confidence interval (CI): 7.50, 12.67); for upper extremities, RR = 5.76 (95% CI: 4.46, 7.45); and for lower extremities, RR = 7.06 (95% CI: 6.03, 8.25)). In dry-field game situations, head and neck injury rates were 1.59 times higher on artificial turf than on natural grass (95% CI: 1.04, 2.42). Lower extremity game injury rates were higher on artificial turf than on natural grass under both dry (RR = 1.83, 95% CI: 1.35, 2.48) and wet (RR = 2.31, 95% CI: 1.18, 4.52) field conditions. Injury rates increased with every additional year of participation. Past injury increased the rate of subsequent injury. The effect of an artificial field surface may be related to infrequent use. Risk factors for injury included participation in a game, playing on artificial turf, being a veteran player, and having a past injury.

J	Arora, RC; Armour, JA				Arora, RC; Armour, JA			Adenosine A(1) receptor activation reduces myocardial reperfusion effects on intrinsic cardiac nervous system	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY-REGULATORY INTEGRATIVE AND COMPARATIVE PHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						myocardium; ventricular neurons	NEURONAL-ACTIVITY; GANGLION NEURONS; ARRHYTHMIAS; MECHANISMS; ANALOGS; INJURY; ATP	The intrinsic cardiac nervous system is the final common integrator of regional cardiac function. The ischemic myocardium modifies this nervous system. We sought to determine the role that intrinsic cardiac neuronal P-1 purinergic receptors play in transducing myocardial ischemia and the subsequent reperfusion. The activity generated by ventricular neurons was recorded concomitant with cardiac hemodynamic variables in 44 anesthetized pigs. Regional ventricular ischemia was induced by briefly occluding (30 s) the ventral interventricular coronary artery distal to the arterial blood supply of identified ventricular neurons. Adenosine (100 muM) was administered to these neurons via their local arterial blood supply during or immediately after transient coronary artery occlusion. Occlusion was also performed following local administration of adenosine A(1) [8-cyclopentyl-1,3- dipropylxanthine (DPCPX)] or A(2) [3,7-dimethyl-1-propargylxanthine (DMPX)] receptor blocking agents. The activity generated by ventricular neurons was modified by transient coronary artery occlusion and the subsequent reperfusion (| Delta | 112 +/- 14 and 168 +/- 34 impulses/min, respectively; P < 0.01 vs. preischemic states). Locally administered adenosine attenuated neuronal responses to reperfusion (-75%; P < 0.01 compared with normal reperfusion) but not ischemia. The neuronal stabilizing effects that adenosine elicited during reperfusion persisted in the presence of DMPX but not DPCPX. It is concluded that activation of neuronal adenosine A(1) receptors stabilizes the intrinsic cardiac nervous system during reperfusion.

Patients with an anterior temporal excision are known to have impairments in memory for facts and the question arises as to whether they are also impaired in source memory. The present study compared memory for facts and their source in patients with a unilateral frontal cortical or an anterior temporal excision in a situation in which both types of information were encoded explicitly. Patients with a unilateral frontal cortex or a temporal lobe excision watched videos of a game show and were instructed to attend to both the trivia facts and their source (the identity of the speaker or the relative time of presentation). Patients with a frontal cortex excision were not impaired on either fact or source memory. This was true even when a subgroup of patients with an excision involving the dorsolateral frontal cortex was examined. In contrast, patients with a left temporal lobe excision were impaired in both fact and identity source memory and right temporal lobe patients were impaired in identity source memory. All patients performed similarly to normal controls in temporal source memory. The present results are consistent with the view that source information is part of an associative network of information about an episode and that the medial temporal region is critical for both source and content memory. Furthermore, if source information is encoded explicitly, the frontal cortex does not appear to be necessary for its retrieval. Instead, it is proposed that the frontal cortex plays a metacognitive role in memory retrieval.

Control animals received an intracerebral collagenase injection followed by intraperitoneal (IP) saline injection. Sham operated animals received saline only (IC, IP). Forty-eight hours following the surgeries, the brains were removed from the euthanized animals. Cerebral hemispheres were separated and the 4 coronal sections (antero-posterior plane) were weighed. Each slice was dried for 24 h (100degreesC) and weighed again to establish brain water content. In hematoma-induced saline treated rats, significant differences in brain water content were observed when compared to sham operated animals. Rats treated with 1 mg/kg dexamethasone had a significant brain water content decrease; however, no significant differences were observed with higher doses of dexamethasone. In conclusion, low doses of dexamethasone seem to be beneficial for the treatment of cerebral trauma.

The current dose-optimizing Phase II study evaluated the effect of weekly paclitaxel and gemcitabine on the response rate and survival of patients with non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) using dose modifications that permitted optimal treatment intensity. METHODS. Forty-five patients (40 with TNM Stage IV and 5 with TNM Stage IIIB NSCLC) were treated with gemcitabine at 1000 mg/m(2) via a 30-minute intravenous (i.v.) infusion and with paclitaxel at 100 mg/m(2) via a 60-minute i.v. infusion. The first 3 patients received chemotherapy on Days 1, 8, and 15 every 4 weeks; the next 42 patients, participating in the Phase 11 trial, received chemotherapy on Days 1 and 8 every 3 weeks. RESULTS. The 3 patients who received paclitaxel and gemcitabine on Days 1, 8, and 15 every 4 weeks tolerated the treatment poorly. One patient died suddenly after Day 15 treatment during the first cycle, and the other 2 patients discontinued the treatment because of unacceptable toxicity before the third cycle of chemotherapy. The next 42 patients, 40 of whom were evaluable, entered this trial between May 2000 and April 2001. They received paclitaxel at 100 mg/m(2) i.v. followed by gemcitabine at 1000 mg/m(2) i.v. on Days 1 and 8 every 3 weeks. Two patients (5%) achieved complete response, 20 (50%) achieved partial response, and 8 (20%) had stable disease. Median survival (MS) was 9.8 months; and 1-year survival was 35%. The 32 patients with performance status (PS) 0 or 1 had an MS of 11 months; the 8 patients with PS 2 had an MS of 3 months. Toxicity (especially hematologic toxicity, neuropathy, and alopecia) was minimal. CONCLUSION. A weekly paclitaxel and gemcitabine regimen that incorporated the authors' dose modifications resulted in good efficacy with minimal toxicity. Cancer 2003;97:2242-7. (C) 2003 American Cancer Society.

The expression of constitutive NOS, endothelial NOS (eNOS) and neuronal NOS (nNOS), were assessed in kidney of the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) and the normotensive Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rat by Western blot analysis and immunocytochemistry. Neuronal NOS expression was observed in the cortex and eNOS was detected only in the inner medulla of both WKY and SHR. In SHR, expression of eNOS was attenuated to 35.1 +/- 10.8%, while expression of nNOS was only 57.5 +/- 5.7% of the levels seen in WKY rat. Immunocytochemical studies revealed decreased staining of nNOS in the macula densa, collecting ducts and in the glomerulus of SHR compared to WKY rat. Endothelial NOS immunoreactivity was restricted to vascular structures of the inner intima cells and smooth muscle cells, and was markedly reduced in the vasculature of SHR. The decreased renal blood flow observed in SHR may be linked to a diminished expression of eNOS and nNOS, underscoring the importance of these enzymes in the pathophysiology and maintenance of genetic hypertension.

J	Khan, YU; Gotman, J				Khan, YU; Gotman, J			Wavelet based automatic seizure detection in intracerebral electroencephalogram	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						epilepsy; automatic seizure detection; electroencephalogram; discrete wavelet transform	ORGANIZING NEURAL-NETWORK; EEG; SYSTEM; ONSET	Background: Automatic seizure detection is often used during long-term monitoring, and is particularly important during intracerebral investigations. Existing methods make many false detections, particularly in intracerebral electroencephalogram (EEG) because of frequent large amplitude rhythmic activity bursts that are non-epileptiform. Objective: To develop a seizure detection method for intracerebral monitoring that is as sensitive as existing methods but has fewer false detections. Methods: To capture the rhythmic nature of seizure discharges, we developed a wavelet-based method, examining how different frequency ranges fluctuate compared to the background. In particular, the system remembers rhythmic bursts occurring commonly in the background to avoid detecting them as seizures. Results: The method was evaluated on test data from 11 patients, including 229 h and 66 seizures, and its performance compared to the method of Gotman (Electroencephalogr clin Neurophysiol 76 (1990) 317). Detection sensitivity was unchanged at close to 90%, but false detections were reduced from 2.4 to 0.3/h. Conclusions: Perfect sensitivity is unlikely because the morphology of seizure discharges is so variable. Nevertheless, the 87% sensitivity obtained in the combined training and testing data is quite high. We reduced the average false alarm rate to one per 3 h of recording, or 6 per 24-h period. Given how rapidly one can decide visually that a detection is erroneous, false detections should not cause any burden to the reviewer. Significance: In intracerebral EEG it is possible to detect seizures automatically with high sensitivity and high specificity. (C) 2003 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

Formulated in a clinical context, in reaction to the psychoanalytic interpretation of addiction as a pleasure seeking pathology, Khantzian's hypothesis holds that schizophrenic patients use psychoactive substances to relieve their symptoms. Properly understood, this conjecture presupposes that, with the relief of certain target symptoms, substance use would no more be a necessity. But in reality, the use of psychoactive substances usually leads to a general deterioration of the patients' condition. Pharmacodependent schizophrenic patients relapse more often, they are more frequently hospitalized, they show more violent behaviors, and they are more frequently homeless. In particular, the positive symptoms of these patients are generally exacerbated by the psychoactive drugs - with the possible exception of opiates. This observation is in lign with the fact that psychostimulants (cocaine, amphetamines), anesthesic dissociatives (PCP, ketamine) as well as hallucinogens (cannabis, LSD) are all known to exert psychotomimetic effects. As for negative symptoms, the reality is more complex. Preliminary results certainly suggest that stimulants (minor or major) relieve these symptoms, but in the case of the other psychoactive substances, empirical evidence remains fragmentary. Still, the properties of psychoactive substances invite to pay close attention, among the negative symptoms, to the cognitive deficits, the social inaptitudes and the hedonic deficits of these patients. Unsatisfied with the self-medication hypothesis, an increasing number of researchers hypothesize that schizophrenic patients abuse drugs in hope to relieve the negative affects (stress, depression) that commonly accompany their symptomatology. Intesrestingly, increasing data link these negative manifestations and substance abuse among schizophrenic patients. But these same data do not elucidate whether these manifestations are primary or secondary to drug abuse. For the moment, these findings must be replicated. Furthermore, it remains to be clarified what negative affect is involved here. Is it stress, anxiety or, as commonly thought, depression ? Other paths aim in the direction of personality traits and dissociation. The first path is suggested by recent studies demonstrating that pharmacodependent schizophrenic patients differ from non-abusing schizophrenics in that their personality is characterized by traits such as sensation seeking and impulsivity. As for the secondpath, it is suggested by a recurrent observation in addictive medicine practice, that is : alcohol, cannabis, ketamine, LSD, opiates, PCP, all these substances can induce dissociative states (depersonalization, derealization, etc.). Surprisingly, most of the hypotheses advanced so far have been formulated without reference to neuroscience. However, from a biological perspective, substance abuse among schizophrenic patients appears paradoxical: while the positive symptoms of schizophrenia might involve an hyperactivity of the reward system, the drugs of abuse all seem to increase dopamine release in that same system. That very paradox further casts some doubt on the self-medication hypothesis. And it opens an alternative : schizophrenic patients might be biologically vulnerable to the rewarding effects of drugs abuse. On the therapeutic level finally, the authors argue that "polypharmacy" medications such as clozapine and quetiapine, known to act on the reward system preferentially to the extrapyramidal system and known to dissociate fastly from the dopamine-D-2 receptor, could simplify clinical intervention.

This paper describes the changes in the pattern of rhythmical mastication elicited by stimulation of the sensorimotor cortex during inhibition or excitation of neurons in this nucleus and adjacent parts of nucleus reticularis gigantocellularis (Rgc) in the anaesthetized rabbit. Masticatory movements and electromyographic (EMG) activity of the masseter and digastric muscles produced by cortical stimulation were recorded before, during and after injections of a local anaesthetic (lidocaine) or excitatory amino acid N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) into nPontc and Rgc through a microsyringe with attached microelectrode to record neuronal activity. Lidocaine inhibited local neurons and modified the motor program, and the effects varied with the site of injection. Most injections into the ventral half of nPontc increased cycle duration, digastric burst duration and burst area. The action of lidocaine in dorsal nPontc was more variable, although burst duration and area were often decreased. The effects on the muscle activity were always bilateral. Lidocaine block of the rostromedial part of Rgc had no effect on movements or on EMGs. Injections of NMDA excited local neurons and when injected into ventral nPontc, it completely blocked mastication. Dorsal injections either had no effect or increased cycle frequency, while decreasing burst duration and area. No increases in EMG burst duration or area were observed with NMDA. Our findings suggest that neurons of ventral nPontc tonically inhibit other parts of the central pattern generator during mastication, while dorsal neurons have mixed effects. We incorporated these findings into a new model of the masticatory central pattern generator.

Through ascending projections to the cortex, these arousal systems stimulate cortical activation, characterized by high frequency gamma and low frequency rhythmic theta activity, and through descending projections to the spinal cord, they stimulate muscle tonus along with sensory-motor responsiveness and activity. They are comprised of neuronal aggregates within the brainstem reticular formation, thalamus, posterior hypothalamus and basal forebrain, and they utilize multiple different neurotransmitters. Within the brainstem, neurons of the reticular formation, which predominantly utilize glutamate as a neurotransmitter, stimulate cortical activation by exciting the widespread projecting neurons of the nonspecific thalamo-cortical projection system, which similarly utilize glutamate, and neurons of the ventral extra-thalamic relay systems located in the posterior hypothalamus and basal forebrain, many of which also utilize glutamate. In addition, these systems have descending projections by which they can enhance or modulate muscle tonus and activity. Articulating with these are cholinergic neurons of the ponto-mesencephalic tegmentum and basal forebrain that promote cortical activation during waking and also during rapid eye movement sleep (REMS), in association therein with muscle atonia. Dopaminergic ventral mesencephalic neurons stimulate a highly motivated and positively rewarding state during waking and may also do so during REMS. In contrast, noradrenergic locus coeruleus neurons promote an aroused waking state and prevent REMS as well as slow wave sleep (SWS). Serotonergic raphe neurons promote a seemingly quiet or satiated waking state, which though exclusive of REMS, can actually be conducive to SWS. Histaminergic neurons of the posterior hypothalamus act like noradrenergic neurons in enforcing waking and are joined by neurons in the region that contain orexin, a neuropeptide recently shown to maintain waking and in absentia to be responsible for narcolepsy, or the inability to maintain wakefulness. These multiple arousal systems are grossly redundant, since no one system is absolutely necessary for the occurrence of waking; yet they are differentiated, since each plays a special role in waking and sleep. During SWS, they are submitted to an inhibitory influence arising in part at least from particular GABAergic neurons co-distributed with many neurons of the arousal systems and also concentrated within the basal forebrain and adjacent preoptic region.

Objective: To assess the impact of this drug plan. on the use of three classes of medications: inhaled corticosteroids, neuroleptics and anticonvulsants. Methods: From the computerized drug databases of the Regie de l'assurance maladie du Quebec (RAMQ), we selected three random samples of Quebec residents receiving social assistance, between August 1992 and June 1997 and aged 64 years or less: 55 890 users of inhaled corticosteroids, 29 461 users of neuroleptics and 44 916 users of anticonvulsants. We also obtained data for individuals privately insured by the Commission de]a construction du Quebec (control group). Comparison of the monthly consumption of medications before and after the new drug plan was done using time series models. Results: For individuals receiving social assistance and using inhaled corticosteroids, we observed a statistically significant decrease of 37% of the monthly consumption for the 11 months following the new drug plan. For neuroleptics and anticonvulsants, we observed a non significant decrease of 9 and 10%, respectively. No decrease in drug consumption was observed in the control group. Conclusion: Inhaled corticosteroids was the only class of medications that was found to decrease significantly after the implementation of the drug insurance plan.

Severe MTHFR deficiency results in marked hyperhomocysteinemia and homocystinuria. Patients display developmental delay and a variety of neurological and vascular symptoms. Cloning of the human cDNA and gene has enabled the identification of 29 rare mutations in homocystinuric patients and two common variants [677C>T (A222V) and 1298A>C (E429A)] with mild enzymatic deficiency. Homozygosity for 677C>T or combined heterozygosity for both polymorphisms is associated with mild hyperhomocysteinemia. In this communication, we describe four novel mutations in patients with homocystinuria: two missense mutations (471C>G, 1153M; 1025T>C, M338T), a nonsense mutation (1274G>A, W421X), and a 2bp deletion (1553delAG). We expressed the 1025T>C mutation as well as two previously reported amino acid substitutions [983A>G (N324S) and 1027T>G (W339G)] and observed decreased enzyme activity at 10%, 36%, and 21% of control levels, respectively, with little or no effect on affinity for 5 methyltetrahydrofolate. One of these mutations, 983A>G (N324S), showed flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) responsiveness in vitro. Expression of these mutations in cis with the 677C>T polymorphism, as observed in the patients, resulted in an additional 50% decrease in enzyme activity. This report brings the total to 33 severe mutations identified in patients with severe MTHFR deficiency. (C) 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

So far, the most promising results, that we report here, have been obtained with clozapine. To a lesser extent, quetiapine and olanzapine, both clozapine analogues, have also shown promising results. Further to these observations, the present paper critically reviews the advantages associated with clozapine, quetiapine and olanzapine, and their relevance to the treatment of addiction among schizophrenic patients. Six characteristics seem to distinguish clozapine, quetiapine and olanzapine from the first-generation antipsychotics: (1) acting preferentially on the reward system, these second-generation antipsychotics (mainly clozapine and quetiapine) induce almost no extrapyramidal symptoms; (2) quickly dissociating from D-2, theses drugs (mainly clozapine and quetiapine) seem not to induce dysphoria, unlike conventional antipsychotics like haloperidol;(3) these drugs (mainly clozapine) seem more effective in the treatment of negative symptoms than conventional antipsychotics; (4) because of a diversified activity on several serotoninergic and noradrenergic receptors, these drugs positively alter mood, which does not seem to be the case with conventional antipsychotics, except for flupenthixol; (5) these drugs have a positive impact on cognition, which is not the case with the first-generation antipsychotics; (6) unlike conventional antipsychotics, these drugs seem to have a moderate affinity for 5-HT3, the receptor on which ondansetron, an anti-craving medication, acts.

Two subjects in whom hypnotic deafness was induced resembled the patient. In contrast, patients with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) showed a significantly delayed return of EMG to baseline, compared with normals and schizophrenics following administration of auditory startle stimuli. Blood pressure (BP) of GAD patients was also slower to return to baseline than that of normals and schizophrenics. BP recorded continuously during seven consecutive tests revealed a striking difference between GAD patients and controls. While the controls' BP generally decreased during the session, pressure of the GAD patients remained at their initial levels. These data are interpreted in relation to allodynamic autonomic regulation as affected by vagal blockade. which appeared to decrease in controls while remaining undiminished in GAD patients. It is suggested that intrusions of uncontrollable worry in GAD patients, and their consequent overuse of certain rostral neural pathways involved in preparation for action prolonged their vagal blockade. A GAD case with typically high frontalis EMG is presented. Frontalis EMGs may provide an exceptionally sensitive indication of neural activity of relevance to GAD. EMG gradients in normal subjects draw attention to Sperry's motoric brain concept, whose influence is strong throughout the paper. Sperry's principle states that the main function of the brain is that of moving the animal in ways that are advantageous for satisfying basic needs and avoiding dangers. Also, with a focus on the motoric brain, some discoveries resulting from brain-recording experiments in freely moving rats are described. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Because interleukin-18 (IL-18) shares many structural and functional similarities with IL-1. the authors tested the hypothesis that IL-18 contributes directly to ischemic brain damage in mice exposed to focal. reversible (15-minute or 30-minute) middle cerebral artery occlusion. IL-18 expression was not induced acutely by middle cerebral artery occlusion, and deletion of the IL-18 gene (IL-18 knockout mice) did not affect infarct volume. The present results suggest that IL-18 does not contribute to acute ischemic brain damage.

However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms that mediate human B cell interaction with the specialized brain endothelial cells comprising the blood-brain barrier (BBB). We studied the molecular mechanisms that regulate the migration of normal human B cells purified ex vivo, across human adult brain-derived endothelial cells (HBECs). We found that B cells migrated across HBECs more efficiently than T cells from the same individuals. B cell migration was significantly inhibited by blocking Abs to the adhesion molecules ICAM-1 and VLA-4, but not VCAM-1, similar to the results previously reported for T cells. Blockade of the chemokines monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and HA, but not RANTES or IFN-gamma-inducible protein-10, significantly inhibited B cell migration, and these results were correlated with the chemokine receptor expression of B cells measured by flow cytometry and by RNase protection assay. Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1, a natural inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinases, significantly decreased B cell migration across the HBECs. A comprehensive RT-PCR comparative analysis of all known matrix metalloproteinases and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases in human B and T cells revealed distinct profiles of expression of these molecules in the different cell subsets. Our results provide insights into the molecular mechanisms that underlie human B cell migration across the BBB. Furthermore, they identify potential common, and unique, therapeutic targets for limiting CNS B cell infiltration and predict how therapies currently developed to target T cell migration, such as anti-VLA-4 Abs, may impact on B cell trafficking.

The profile of induction of mPGES-1 (50- to 80-fold) in the primary paw was similar to that of COX-2 by both RNA and protein analysis. Quantitative PCR analysis indicated that induction of mPGES-1 at day 15 was within 2-fold that of COX-2. Increased PGES activity was measurable in membrane preparations of inflamed paws, and the activity was inhibitable by MK-886 to greater than or equal to90% with a potency similar to that of recombinant rat mPGES-1 (IC50=2.4 muM). The RNA of the newly described mPGES-2 decreased by 2- to 3-fold in primary paws between days 1 and 15 postadjuvant. The cPGES/p23 and COX-1 were induced during AIA, but at much lower levels (2- to 6-fold) than mPGES-1, with the peak of cPGES/p23 expression occurring later than that of COX-2 and PGE, production. Prostacyclin (measured as 6-keto-PGF(1alpha)) was transiently elevated on day 1, and prostacyclin synthase was down-regulated at the RNA level after day 3, suggesting a diminished role of prostacyclin during the maintenance of chronic inflammation in the rat AIA. These results show that mPGES-1 is up-regulated throughout the development of AIA and suggest that it plays a major role in the elevated production of PGE(2) in this model.

Plasma HDL-LpE had a particle size ranging from 9 nm to 18.5 nm in diameter and was characterized by two-dimensional nondenaturing gradient gel electrophoresis as having either gamma-, prebeta(1)-, prebeta(2)-, or alpha-electrophoretic mobility. HDL-LpE was also present in the medium of cultured human hepatoma cell lines and monocyte-derived macrophages. The majority of apoE3 was found as a monomeric form in HDL-LpE and floated at density d > 1.21 g/ml. Plasma levels of HDL-LpE in normolipidemic, CETP-deficient, and ABCA1-deficient subjects were 0.72 +/- 0.15 mg/dl (n = 12),1.77 +/- 0.75 mg/dl (n = 3), and 0.55 +/- 0.11 mg/dl (n = 3), respectively. The ratio of HDL-apoE containing apoA-I to HDL-LpE was significantly higher 4 h after a fat load, representing a 35 +/- 9% increase (n = 3). Isolated plasma HDL-LpE3 was as effective as apoE3, reconstituted HDL particles, or apoA-I in promoting cellular cholesterol efflux. These results demonstrate that 1) plasma HDL-LpE may have hepatogenous and macrophagic origins; 2) HDL-LpE was preserved even with large reductions in apoA-I-containing lipoproteins; 3) HDL-LpE was active in the transfer of apoE to triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, and 4) HDL-LpEs efficiently take up cell-derived cholesterol.

Part 1 reveals a dissociation in performance between impaired short-term memory and preserved long-term memory. Part 2 examines an alternative explanation of I.R.'s performance under a processing view of memory that rejects the notion of dual stores. The results indicate that the patient's performance on immediate serial recall of short lists was influenced by the semantic properties of items. In contrast, the patient did not use phonological properties. A similar pattern was found in supraspan tasks, in which I.R. demonstrated excellent recall. of lexico-semantic material, but impaired memory for phonological information. These data suggest that there is a disruption of memory for phonological features with preserved memory for lexico-semantic features, irrespective of the short-term/long-term memory distinction.

Drosophila larvae crawl over a plain substrate by performing repetitive waves of forward peristalsis alternated by brief episodes of head swinging and turning. To identify sets of central and peripheral neurons required for the spatial or temporal pattern of larval locomotion, we blocked neurotransmitter release from defined populations of neurons by targeted expression of tetanus toxin light chain (TeTxLC) with the GAL4/UAS system. One hundred fifty GAL4 lines were crossed to a UAS-TeTxLC strain and a motion-analysis system was used to identify larvae with abnormal movement patterns. Five lines were selected that show discrete locomotor defects (i.e., increased turning and pausing) and these defects are correlated with diverse sets of central neurons. One line, 4C-GAL4, caused an unusual circling behavior that is correlated with approximately 200 neurons, including dopaminergic and peptidergic interneurons. Expression of TeTxLC in all dopaminergic and serotonergic but not in peptidergic neurons, caused turning deficits that are similar to those of 4C-GAL4/TeTxLC larvae. The results presented here provide a basis for future genetic studies of motor control in the Drosophila larva. (C) 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

We have previously shown that overexpression of the transcription factor p53 can induce oligodendrocyte apoptosis. We investigated the mechanism of p53-induced apoptosis using primary cultures of central nervous system-derived adult human oligodendrocytes. Adenovirus-mediated p53 overexpression resulted in up-regulation of the death receptors Fas, DR4 and DR5 with subsequent caspase-mediated apoptosis of the oligodendrocytes. The oligodendrocytes were protected from p53-induced cell death by blocking signaling through Fas and/or tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) receptors. Although lower levels of p53 did not induce apoptosis, the increase in death receptor expression was sufficient to render the oligodendrocytes susceptible to apoptosis in the presence of exogenous Fas ligand and TRAIL. These ligands are present in the inflammatory milieu of active MS lesions. In situ analysis of active MS lesions revealed increased p53 expression in oligodendrocytes in lesions that featured oligodendrocyte apoptosis and cell loss. Our data provide evidence for a novel role for p53 in the pathogenesis of MS.

However, many of the stimuli used in these studies have little ethological relevance for maternal protection of the litter in a threatening environment. The question that arises is whether the relevance of the stressor to the infant is critical in the 'gating' of the neuroendocrine response. We hypothesized that the presence of pups with their mothers at the time of exposure to an intruder or a predator odour is an effective way to increase the emotional salience of the psychological stressor, thus eliminating the stress hyporesponsiveness in lactating females. We first compared neuroendocrine responses [corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) mRNA in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN) and central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA), plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and corticosterone] between early (EL, PPD3-5), late (LL, PPD 15) lactating and virgin (V) females to a male intruder in the home cage. We next investigated the effect of pups' presence at the time of stressor exposure on the magnitude of the hormonal response to a male intruder in the home cage or to a predator odour (fox urine) in a novel environment. In the male intruder paradigm, levels of CRF mRNA expression in the PVN and CeA were lower in LL compared to EL or V females and plasma ACTH and corticosterone secretion was not as elevated in LL compared to EL females. Aggression towards the intruder was high in EL females in the presence of their pups and a positive correlation was found with the integrated ACTH response. Aggression rapidly declined after pup separation (2.5 h or 48 h) or in LL nursing females. In EL females, the presence of the pups with their mothers (EL+pups) at the time of stress significantly increased plasma ACTH and corticosterone responses to either male intruder or predator odour compared to EL females without their pups for 2.5 h or 48 h (EL-pups). Plasma ACTH response to fox urine in EL+pups females was comparable to that of virgin females, suggesting that increasing the salience of emotionally relevant stimuli by keeping the pups present in the cage could eliminate the hyporesponsiveness detected for EL females without their pups. These studies indicate the critical role of the pups in modulating the maternal response to stressors that represent a threat for the litter. We hypothesize that the amygdala, because of its ability to process olfactory stimuli and stimuli with affective properties, might play an essential role in 'gating' the neuroendocrine response to stress during lactation.

This device maintained the limb in the horizontal plane such that hand motion was generated only by flexor and extensor motions at the shoulder and elbow. The study describes the kinematic and kinetic features of the shoulder, elbow, and hand during reaching movements from a central target to peripheral targets located on the circumference of a circle: the center-out task. While subjects made reaching movements with relatively straight smooth hand paths and little variation in peak hand velocity, there were large variations in joint motion, torque, and power for movements in different spatial directions. Unlike single-joint movements, joint kinematics and kinetics were not tightly coupled for these multijoint movements. For most movements, power generation was predominantly generated at only one of the two joints. The present analysis illustrates the complexities inherent in multijoint movements and forms the basis for understanding strategies used by the motor system to control reaching movements and for interpreting the response of neurons in different brain regions during this task.

The higher rate of low birth weight in developing countries is primarily due to intrauterine growth restriction rather than preterm birth. Much of the excess intrauterine growth restriction is caused by short maternal stature, low prepregnancy body mass index and low gestational weight gain (due to low energy intake). No important contribution has been established for micronutrient intake, nor have different fetal growth trajectories been demonstrated to reflect the timing of exposure to nutritional or other etiologic factors. Infant mortality has declined substantially over time both in developed and developing countries despite no decline (and even an increase) in low birth weight. Several developed countries have reported a temporal increase in fetal growth in infants born at term, a reduction in stillbirth rates and prevention of neural tube defects. More progress is required, however, in understanding the etiology and prevention of preterm birth.

Results: The study group consisted of 9 women and 2 men, with a mean +/- SD age of 50+/-15 years (range, 26-73 years). Seven patients were symptomatic, 3 of whom presented with visual complaints. Four patients presented primarily with endocrine dysfunction (2) or headaches (2). The duration of symptoms varied from 1 to 12 months (mean +/- SD, 6.0+/-4.5 months). Formal visual field testing revealed bitemporal hemianopsia in 6 and a right-sided visual field deficit in 2. The tumor appeared as a well-defined, relatively homogeneously (6) or heterogeneously (1) enhancing suprasellar mass on contrast infusion. Tumor size varied from 1.5 to 6.0 cm (mean +/- SD, 3.1+/-1.6 cm). At surgery, the mass was noted to be firm and vascular, and in at least 3 patients these features prevented gross total resection. Only 1 patient who had undergone biopsy of his, lesion received adjuvant radiation therapy. Followup was obtained, in all but 1 patient. Nine of these 10 patients are alive and are either free of disease or have had no disease progression. Follow-up in these 9 patients varied from 1 to 16 years (mean +/- SD, 6.5+/-6.3years). Conclusions: A granular cell tumor is generally a surprise finding in that it is seldom considered in the differential diagnosis of contrast-enhancing, demarcated sellar region masses. Granular cell tumors are benign and slow growing with no pronounced tendency for, invasion or recurrence. Because of the indolent growth of granular cell tumors, the, surgical goal of tumor decompression is a reasonable therapeutic approach.

It has been hypothesized that blockade of D2 receptors by antipsychotics is responsible for the induction of c-fos, but the mechanism has not been determined. Using cultured ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopaminergic neurons as a model, we report that nanomolar concentrations of haloperidol cause a time-dependent increase in Fos expression in dopaminergic neurons. Surprisingly, this induction was not mimicked by sulpiride, a selective D2 receptor antagonist, and was not blocked by Rp-cAMPS, an antagonist of protein kinase A (PKA), thus suggesting that D2 receptors and the cAMP cascade are not required. The induction of Fos expression was blocked by tetrodotoxin, BAPTA and KN-93, thus showing that it is activity- and calcium-dependent and requires the activation of a calmodulin-dependent kinase (CaMK). Together, these results suggest that haloperidol induces Fos expression in dopaminergic neurons through a D2 receptor-independent increase in intracellular calcium, leading to CaMK activation.

J	Shevell, MI; Majnemer, A; Morin, I				Shevell, MI; Majnemer, A; Morin, I			Etiologic yield of cerebral palsy: A contemporary case series	PEDIATRIC NEUROLOGY			English	Article							INTRAPARTUM ASPHYXIA; DEVELOPMENTAL DELAY; CHILDREN; BIRTH; PREDICTION; TERM; RISK	Cerebral palsy is an established symptom complex that results from heterogeneous etiologies. Our understanding of the relative contribution of underlying etiologies to the occurrence of cerebral palsy is largely derived from studies lacking systematic neurologic evaluation or the application of contemporary imaging modalities. Throughout a 10-year inclusive period, the case records of all consecutive patients diagnosed with cerebral palsy in a single pediatric neurology practice were reviewed with reference to clinical features and diagnostic yield. A total of 217 cases of cerebral palsy were identified (129 male, 88 female): 77 (35.5%) spastic quadriplegic, 68 (31.3%) spastic hemiplegic, 39 (18%) spastic diplegic, five (2.7%) spastic monoplegic, 12 (5.5%) mixed, 12 (5.5%) ataxic-hypotonic, two (0.9%) dyskinetic, two (0.9%) Worster-Drought syndrome. Overall etiologic yield was 82.0%, varying according to type of cerebral palsy: 50% dyskinetic, 59% diplegia, 80% monoplegia, 80.9% hemiplegia, 90.9% quadriplegia, 91.7% ataxic hypotonia, and 100% mixed/Woster-Drought. The top five etiologic entities identified were periventricular leukomalacia, 24.9%; intrapartum asphyxia, 21.7%; cerebral dysgenesis, 17.1%; intracranial hemorrhage, 12.9%; and vascular, 9.7%. Although a single etiology was apparent in 144 (66.4%) of the cases, multiple etiologies were believed to be contributory in 34 (15.6%) of the cases. The etiologic profile varied according to such features as the type of cerebral palsy, gestational age, and the source (high-risk neonatal population or not) of the patients. Features of the child's cerebral palsy, such as microcephaly, neonatal difficulties, prior or coexisting epilepsy, and high-risk source, were found to be predictive of eventual etiologic yield. This contemporary evaluation of cerebral palsy etiologic yield suggests that it is much higher than previously reported and varies, depending on key clinical features. (C) 2003 by Elsevier Inc.

J	Pepin, A; Norman, KE; Barbeau, H				Pepin, A; Norman, KE; Barbeau, H			Treadmill walking in incomplete spinal-cord-injured subjects: 1. Adaptation to changes in speed	SPINAL CORD			English	Article						spinal cord injury; gait; speed; treadmill walking	SPASTIC PARETIC SUBJECTS; FUNCTIONAL CLASSIFICATION; INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS; H-REFLEX; LOCOMOTION; GAIT; RECOVERY; HYPERTONIA; EMG; CAT	Walking in spinal-cord-injured (SCI) subjects is usually achieved at a lower speed than in normal subjects. Study design/methods: Time and distance parameters, angular displacements of lower limbs and electromyographic (EMG) activity were measured for seven normal and seven SCI subjects at several walking speeds. Analyses of variance were used for comparing groups and speeds. Objectives: First, to measure the adaptability of SCI subjects' walking pattern to different speeds (0.1-1.0m/s), and to compare it to that of normal subjects. Second, to characterize SCI subjects' walking pattern as compared to that of normal subjects at a matched treadmill speed (0.3 m/s). Setting: University-Based Human Gait Laboratory, Montreal, Canada. Results: SCI subjects' pattern adapted to a limited range of speeds. Longer cycle duration, flexed knee at foot contact, increased hip joint flexion at foot contact and during swing, and altered coordination of hip and knee joints were found for the SCI group. At all speeds, duration of muscle activity was longer in the SCI group and the increase in amplitude of soleus EMG activity at higher speeds was not specific to push-off. The importance of matching the walking speed of SCI and normal subjects in order to differentiate the features that are a consequence of SCI subjects' reduced walking speed rather than a direct consequence of the injury is demonstrated. Conclusions: All SCI subjects could adapt to a narrow range of speeds and only three could reach the maximal tested speed. This limited maximal speed seems to be a consequence of SCI subjects having reached their limit in increasing stride length and not being able to increase stride frequency further. This limitation in increasing stride frequency is likely because of the altered neural drive.

Stride length and frequency were measured at different walking speeds under three different conditions: preferred, highest possible and lowest possible stepping frequencies. Objective: To determine which factors are limiting the maximal walking speed in spinal-cord-injured (SCI) individuals. Setting: University-Based Human Gait Laboratory, Montreal, Canada. Results: It is shown that maximal stride frequency was the predominant limiting factor of the maximal treadmill-walking speed in SCI subjects. These results were explained in the light of the forced hybrid mass-spring pendulum model. At all speeds, SCI subjects spent longer time in stance, swing and double support phases. The relative time spent in single support is greater at higher walking speed and the difficulty to reduce double support time is a limiting factor. Conclusions: A better understanding of the factors limiting the maximal speed in SCI subjects should help developing rehabilitation interventions oriented towards increasing the control and the capacity of walking. Rehabilitation strategies should put the emphasis on improving the capacity to produce rapid alternate rhythmical stepping movements of the lower limbs.

With some notable exceptions outside the primate order, such as the classic work on echo-locating bats, owls and birdsong, the auditory cortex has been overlooked: only a few investigators were involved in understanding the structure and function of the monkey auditory cortex, and even fewer had the means to study its human counterpart. This situation has undergone a dramatic change in the past decade or so. Spurred on by advances in primate neurophysiology and neuroanatomy, and especially by developments in functional neuroimaging, substantial progress is now being made into understanding how the human auditory cortical system works.

VISUAL COGNITION			English	Article							DOMAIN SPECIFICITY; OCCIPITOTEMPORAL CORTEX; RESPONSE PROPERTIES; OBJECT RECOGNITION; ATTRACTIVE FACES; TEMPORAL CORTEX; PERCEPTION; AREA; PROSOPAGNOSIA; MODULARITY	"Is face perception special?" has become one of the most frequently asked questions among cognitive scientists. This issue has generated considerable debate and produced diversified rather than unified answers around the polarized "yes-no" positions. The ongoing confusion in this field now calls for a theoretical synthesis. The goal of this paper is to review and examine the conceptual basis of the contradictory claims and to offer a unified scheme for experimental inquiry. We argue that most differences in the stated claims can be traced to conceptual rather than empirical determinants. Assessment discrepancies arise prior to empirical investigations because of the use of unfounded assumptions. The key to resolving the current controversy will largely depend upon settling some conceptual issues. We propose to replace the commonly adopted approach of assessing a single criterion with one where the question is addressed along multiple dimensions that include comparison of face and object perception in terms of their innate specification, localization, and domain specificity using developmental, neuropsychological, and neurophysiological measures.

Methods: Between 1990 and 2000, 31 patients (11 men; mean +/- SD age 34.3 +/- 11.7 years) with nonlesional intractable TLE were consecutively selected on the basis of the absence or paucity of IEA (<1/h) on serial scalp EEG recording; these were defined as "oligospikers." The clinical and laboratory characteristics of oligospikers were compared with those of a group of 27 age-matched control subjects (10 men; mean +/- SD age 38.5 +/- 11 years), randomly selected from a pool of patients with nonlesional TLE with frequent IEA. Results: Oligospikers showed a later age at seizure onset (mean SD 19.1 +/- 14.4 versus 10.2 +/- 7.4 years; p = 0.004), lower monthly frequency of complex partial seizures (median 6 versus 12; p = 0.035), lower incidence of secondarily generalized tonic-clonic seizures (10 versus 81%; p < 0.001), and no status epilepticus (0 versus 22%) than control subjects. Also, hippocampal. atrophy (HA) was less commonly found in oligospikers (55 versus 96%; p = 0.001). However, there were no differences between the two groups in the frequency of family history of epilepsy, risk factors, febrile convulsions, and type of medication. Twenty-three (74%) oligospikers and 25 (93%) control patients underwent either a selective amygdalohippocampectomy or corticoamygdalohippocampectomy. Excellent surgical outcome (Engel's Class Ia) was found in 14 of 23 (61%) oligospikers and 17 of 25 (67%) control patients. Conclusions: This study identified a subgroup of patients with nonlesional intractable TLE with no or few IEA. Oligospikers have a later age at seizure onset, less frequent and less severe seizures, besides a lower incidence of HA. The similarity of etiologic factors compared with patients with frequent IEA suggests that the rarity of spikes could reflect a disease not really distinct but less severe, even though still intractable and incapacitating enough to consider surgery. In spite of the absence or paucity of IEA, oligospikers have excellent surgical outcome.

Methods: Thalamic volume measurements were carried out using high-resolution MRI in 40 patients with pharmacologically intractable temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), 16 patients with extratemporal lobe epilepsy (ETE), and 17 with idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE). Thalamic volumes of patients were compared with those of 21 neurologically normal control subjects. Volumes were correlated with duration of epilepsy. The effect of prolonged febrile seizures and generalized seizures on thalamic volumes was examined. Results: Compared with normal control subjects, patients with TLE had a reduction in thalamic volume ipsilateral to the seizure focus. Thalamic volumes in patients with ETE and IGE were not significantly different from those of normal control subjects. In TLE patients, thalamic volumes ipsilateral to the seizure focus were negatively correlated with duration of epilepsy. Patients with a history of prolonged febrile seizures had more severe thalamic atrophy ipsilateral to the seizure focus than those without febrile seizures. Conclusions: Thalamic atrophy ipsilateral to the seizure focus is found in TLE but riot in other forms of focal epilepsy or IGE. In TLE, thalamic atrophy is correlated with duration of disease. Patients with a history of prolonged febrile seizures had smaller thalamic volumes ipsilateral to the seizure focus than those without.

Neurons of synaptojanin 1-deficient mice display an increase in clathrin-coated vesicles and delayed reentry of recycling vesicles into the fusion-competent vesicle pool, but no defects in early steps of endocytosis [3, 4]. Here we show that inhibition of synaptojanin 2 expression via small interfering (si) RNA causes a strong defect in clathrin-mediated receptor internalization in a lung carcinoma cell line. This inhibitory phenotype is rescued by overexpression of wildtype synaptojanin 2, but not of wild-type synaptojanin I or mutant synaptojanin 2 that is deficient in 5'-phosphatase activity. In addition, electron-microscopic analysis shows that synaptojanin 2 depletion causes a decrease in clathrin-coated pits and vesicles. These results suggest a role for synaptojanin 2 in clathrin-coated pit formation and imply that lipid hydrolysis is required at an early stage of clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Taken together, our results also indicate that synaptojanin 2 is functionally distinct from synaptojanin 1.

J	Wong, EV; David, S; Jacob, MH; Jay, DG				Wong, EV; David, S; Jacob, MH; Jay, DG			Inactivation of myelin-associated glycoprotein enhances optic nerve regeneration	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						MAG; CALI; optic nerve explants; nerve regeneration; retinal neurons; myelin	NEURITE GROWTH-INHIBITORS; ASSISTED LASER INACTIVATION; AXONAL REGENERATION; ANTIBODY; SYSTEM; MICE; DEFICIENT; OUTGROWTH; RECOVERY; RECEPTOR	CNS regeneration in higher vertebrates is a long sought after goal in neuroscience. The lack of regeneration is attributable in part to inhibitory factors found in myelin (Caroni and Schwab, 1988a). Myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG) is an abundant myelin protein that inhibits neurite outgrowth in vitro (McKerracher et al., 1994; Mukhopadhyay et al., 1994), but its role in regeneration remains controversial. To address this role, we performed nerve crush on embryonic day 15 chick retina-optic nerve explants and then acutely eliminated MAG function along the nerve using chromophore-assisted laser inactivation ( CALI). CALI of MAG permitted significant regrowth of retinal axons past the site of lesion containing CNS myelin in contrast to various control treatments. Electron microscopy of the site of nerve crush shows abundant regenerating axons crossing the gap. When crushed optic nerve was retrogradely labeled at the nerve stump, no labeling of retinal neurons was observed. In contrast, labeling of CALI of MAG-treated crushed optic nerve showed significant retinal labeling (89 +/- 16 cells per square millimeter), a value indistinguishable from that seen with non-crushed nerve (98 +/- 13 cells per square millimeter). These findings implicate MAG as an important component of the myelin-derived inhibition of nerve regeneration. The acute loss of MAG function can promote significant axon growth across a site of CNS nerve damage.

Via quantitative trait locus mapping followed by a candidate gene strategy using both mutant mice and pharmacological tools, we now demonstrate that the melanocortin-1 receptor (Mc1R) gene mediates K-opioid analgesia in female mice only. This finding suggested that individuals with variants of the human Mc1R gene, associated in our species with red hair and fair skin, might also display altered kappa-opioid analgesia. We found that women with two variant MC1R alleles displayed significantly greater analgesia from the kappa-opioid, pentazocine, than all other groups. This study demonstrates an unexpected role for the MOR gene, verifies that pain modulation in the two sexes involves neurochemically distinct substrates, and represents an example of a direct translation of a pharmacogenetic finding from mouse to human.

HGF binds to and activates Met receptor tyrosine kinase. The signaling receptor complex for GDNF typically includes both GDNF family receptor alpha1 (GFRalpha1) and Ret receptor tyrosine kinase. GDNF can also signal independently of Ret via GFRalpha1, although the mechanism has remained unclear. We now show that GDNF partially restores ureteric branching morphogenesis in ret-deficient mice with severe renal hypodysplasia. The mechanism of Ret-independent effect of GDNF was therefore studied by the MDCK cell model. In MDCK cells expressing GFRalpha1 but no Ret, GDNF stimulates branching but not chemotactic migration, whereas both branching and chemotaxis are promoted by GDNF in the cells coexpressing Ret and GFRalpha1, mimicking HGF/Met responses in wild-type MDCK cells. Indeed, GDNF induces Met phosphorylation in several ret-deficient/GFRalpha1-positive and GFRalpha1/Ret-coexpressing cell lines. However, GDNF does not immunoprecipite Met, making a direct interaction between GDNF and Met highly improbable. Met activation is mediated by Src family kinases. The GDNF-induced branching of MDCK cells requires Src activation, whereas the HGF-induced branching does not. Our data show a mechanism for the GDNF-induced branching morphogenesis in non-Ret signaling.

Y., Cafferty, P. W., Sobue, K., Agarwal-Mawal, A., Neufield, K. D., and Paudel, H. K. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277,11933-11940). In this study, we find that when purified brain microtubules are subjected to Superose 12 gel filtration column chromatography, the dimeric scaffold protein 14-3-3xi coelutes with the tau phosphorylation complex components tau and GSK3beta. From gel filtration fractions containing the tau phosphorylation complex, 14-3-3xi, GSK3beta, and tau co-immunoprecipitate with each other. From extracts of bovine brain, COS-7 cells, and HEK-293 cells transfected with GSK3beta, 14-3-3xi co-precipitates with GSK3beta, indicating that GSK3beta binds to 14-3-3xi. From HEK-293 cells transfected with tau, GSK3beta, and 14-3-3xi in different combinations, tau co-immunoprecipitates with GSK3beta only in the presence of 14-3-3xi. In vitro, similar to10-fold more tau binds to GSK3beta in the presence of than in the absence of 14-3-3xi. In transfected HEK-293 cells, 14-3-3xi stimulates GSK3beta-catalyzed tau phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner. These data indicate that in brain, the 14-3-3xi dimer simultaneously binds and bridges tau and GSK3beta and stimulates GSK3beta-catalyzed tau phosphorylation.

The Txl-2 open reading frame codes for a protein of 330 amino acids consisting of two distinct domains: an N-terminal domain typical of thioredoxins and a C-terminal domain belonging to the nucleoside-diphosphate kinase family, separated by a small interface domain. The Txl-2 gene spans similar to28 kb, is organized into 11 exons, and maps at locus 3q22.3-q23. A splicing variant lacking exon 5 (Delta5Txl-2) has also been isolated. By quantitative real time PCR we demonstrate that Txl-2 mRNA is ubiquitously expressed, with testis and lung having the highest levels of expression. Unexpectedly, light and electron microscopy analyses show that the protein is associated with microtubular structures such as lung airway epithelium cilia and the manchette and axoneme of spermatids. Using in vitro translated proteins, we demonstrate that full-length Txl-2 weakly associates with microtubules. In contrast, Delta5Txl-2 specifically binds with very high affinity brain microtubule preparations containing microtubule-binding proteins. Importantly, Delta5Txl-2 also binds to pure microtubules, proving that it possesses intrinsic microtubule binding capability. Taken together, Delta5Txl-2 is the first thioredoxin reported to bind microtubules and might therefore be a novel regulator of microtubule physiology.

There is growing and consistent evidence suggesting that genetic factors play an important role in the predisposition to suicide. Based on several lines of evidence supporting a reduced serotonergic neurotransmission in subjects who committed suicide, we investigated variation at genes that code for serotonin receptor 1B (5-HTR1B), 1Dalpha (5-HTR1Dalpha), 1E (5-HTR1E), 1F (5-HTR1F), 2C (5-HTR2C), 5A (5-HTR5A), and 6 (5-HTR6) in a total sample of 106 suicide completers and 120 normal controls. No differences were observed in allelic or genotypic distributions between groups for any of the loci investigated. Moreover, further analysis according to suicide method or psychopathology also failed to reveal differences between groups. Our results do not support a substantial role of these serotonergic receptors in suicide completion. (C) 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Platelet-activating factor (PAF) is generated during oxidant stress. We studied the vasomotor mode of actions of PAF on periventricular (PV) microvessels of fetal (approximate to75% of term), newborn (1-3 days), and adult pigs. PAF constricted PV microvessels from fetal (29.27 +/- 2.6%) and newborn (22.14 +/- 3.2%) pigs but was ineffective in adults (<2.5%). Specific [H-3] PAF binding was greater in fetus and newborn than in adults; a concordant developmental PAF-induced inositol phosphate formation was observed. PAF-induced vasoconstriction was abrogated by thromboxane A(2) (TXA(2)) synthase and receptor inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, and by removal of endothelium; vasoconstriction to TXA(2) mimetic U-46619 did not differ with age. Immunoreactive TXA(2) synthase expression and PAF-evoked TXA(2) formation revealed a fetus> newborn>adult profile. Thus the greater PAF-induced PV microvascular constriction in younger subjects seems attributable to greater PAF receptor density and mostly secondary to TXA(2) formation from endothelium. The resulting decrease in blood flow may contribute to the increased vulnerability of the PV brain regions to oxidant stress-induced injury in immature subjects.

Because evidence suggests that multiple pathways may contribute to ALS pathogenesis, we tested in a mouse model of ALS (SOD1(G37R) mice) a combination approach consisting of three drugs for distinct targets in the complex pathway to neuronal death: minocycline, an antimicrobial agent that inhibits microglial activation, riluzole, a glutamate antagonist, and nimodipine, a voltage-gated calcium channel blocker. The efficacy of this three-drug cocktail was remarkable when administered in the diet from late presymptomatic stage (8-9 months). It delayed the onset of disease, slowed the loss of muscle strength, and increased the average longevity of SOD1(G37R) mice by 6 weeks. The protective effect of the treatment was corroborated by the reduced immunodetection signals for markers of gliosis and neurodegeneration in the spinal cord of SOD1(G37R) mice. These results indicate that such three-drug combination may represent an effective strategy for ALS treatment.

Homocysteine remethylation to methionine is catalyzed by folate-dependent methionine synthase, or by betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase (BHMT), which utilizes betaine as the methyl donor. Since genetic variants in folate-dependent remethylation have been reported to increase risk for cardiovascular disease and other common disorders, we screened BHMT for sequence changes that might alter risk for coronary artery disease (CAD). A variant in exon 6-R239Q-was identified. The frequency of this change was examined in 504 individuals who had undergone coronary angiography and were stratified into controls (those with no or mild disease) and cases (those with significant [> 50% reduction in luminal diameter stenosis] 1-, 2-, 3vessel disease). Although this variant did not affect plasma homocysteine, the QQ genotype was present in higher frequency in those with no or mild disease, compared with those with significant disease (11 vs. 6%), suggesting that it may decrease risk of CAD; a statistically-significant decrease was seen in the older subjects (13 vs. 7%). Multivariate analysis for the entire group revealed an odds ratio of 0.48 (95% CI: 0.21-1.06) for the QQ genotype; this association was similar in the younger (OR = 0.36; 95% CI: 0.09-1.41) and older subjects (OR = 0.42; 95% CI: 0.15-1.18). Our study suggests that the Q allele of the R239Q mutation may decrease the risk of CAD and that this variant warrants additional investigation of its relationship with the development of CAD as well as other homocysteine-dependent disorders.

Clinical features: A 66-yr-old diabetic female with no cardiovascular disease was anesthetized for a partial mastectomy. While in the postanesthesia care unit, she suffered two episodes of asystole after iv metoclopramide 10 mg, The first episode lasted ten seconds and corrected spontaneously while the second episode, lasting less than one minute required closed chest massage and atropine iv 0.8 mg. The cardiac investigation that followed was inconclusive for ischemia and the patient did not experience any other episodes of dysrhythmia. No formal investigation was done to disclose diabetic autonomic neuropathy. However, based on the results of dipyridamole myocardial single photon emission computed tomography, if diabetic autonomic neuropathy was present, it was very mild. Conclusion: The patient sustained two episodes of asystole after iv metoclopramide 10 mg in the immediate postoperative period in the absence of any predisposing cardiac history or medication. Diabetes, even without overt autonomic neuropathy, may have been a predisposing factor for sinus arrest after iv metoclopramide.

The purpose of this study was to assess at rest the effects of 30% oxygen inhalation on dyspnea, breathing pattern, neuromuscular inspiratory drive based on measurement of mouth occlusion pressure (P-0.1), and dynamic hyperinflation (DH), as reflected by changes in inspiratory capacity (IC). Methods: Ten patients with stable CAO receiving long-term oxygen were studied at rest, before and after 5, 15, and 25 min of oxygen administration. Severity of dyspnea was rated using the visual analog scale (VAS). Breathing pattern parameters, P-0.1, IC, and tidal expiratory flow limitation (EFL), were measured sequentially. Results: Eight patients exhibited EFL under baseline condition. During 30% oxygen breathing, the VAS score significantly decreased, associated with a concurrent increase of IC (11%). There was also a significant reduction of minute ventilation and tidal volume (11% and 12%, respectively), which was due to a significant decrease of mean inspiratory flow. Although not significantly, P-0.1 decreased by 13%. Finally, two patients reverted from EFL to no EFL. Conclusion: Patients with CAO receiving long-term oxygen may benefit from hyperoxic breathing at rest, since it decreases the ventilation and the degree of DH, with concurrent improvement of dyspnea sensation.

Method: The CHI patients were compared to 12 normal controls with a neuropsychological test battery, a script recitation task and a realistic simulation of complex multitask ADL (planning and preparing a meal). Results: Though the CHI patients were significantly slow on one test and subject to interference on an attention test with parametric testing, the groups did not differ on any neuropsychological test with non parametric testing. However, the CHI patients manifested marked anomalies in the meal preparation task. While small sequences of actions were easily produced, large action sets could not be correctly executed. Conclusion: An outstanding deficit in strategic planning and prospective memory appears to be an important underpinning of the impairment of ADL observed in CHI patients with frontal lobe lesions.

Emerging themes regarding the function and regulation of these enzymes include the following: targeted and non-targeted chromatin deacetylation; their collaboration with each other and with other chromatin regulators to promote transcriptional repression and silencing; deacetylation of transcription factors and other non-histone proteins; and regulation by subcellular compartmentalization and subunit association. Histone deacetylases are important targets for drugs with potential therapeutic value in the treatment of cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, cardiac hypertrophy and other human diseases.

The weight of the evidence from randomized controlled trials of estrogen and cognition in women shows that this hormone preferentially protects verbal memory in postmenopausal women, whereas findings from observational studies are less consistent and show a more diffuse effect of estrogen on a range of cognitive functions. There is fairly consistent evidence from epidemiological studies that ERT significantly reduces the risk of Alzheimer's disease ( AD) in women. On the other hand, findings from controlled treatment trials of women diagnosed with probable AD failed to show that physiological doses of ERT ameliorate existing deficits in cognitive functioning and/or prevent further deterioration in memory that inevitably occurs in these women over time. Finally, an accumulating body of evidence is beginning to suggest that the immediate postmenopausal period may constitute a critical window for treatment with ERT that maximizes its potential to protect against cognitive decline with aging and/or to reduce the risk of AD.

In this study, we investigated several factors as the possible mechanism for this effect, including age at convulsions. Methods: Rats were injected with PTZ on postnatal day (P) 18-20 or >P60, and neuronal activity was recorded intra- and extracellularly from CA3 5-10 or >40 days later. In additional experiments, convulsions were triggered by kainate or were blocked by pentobarbital. Hippocampal (a) acetylcholine (ACh) innervation density was measured by immunocytochemistry, and ACh and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) contents were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-electrospray ionization. Results: The excitatory effect of eserine was the most consistent in slices from rats PTZ-treated when immature and after the long interval, whereas the reverse was true in rats treated as adults. This effect was dependent on the occurrence of a seizure and was less prevalent when the seizure had been provoked by kainate. Adult animals PTZ-treated at P20 did not differ from control in (a) poly- or monosynaptic GABA(A) and GABA(B) CA3 inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs); (b) density of ACh innervation; or (c) tissue content of ACh and GABA. Conclusions: A PTZ-induced generalized seizure in immature rat provokes endogenous ACh-induced interictal-like discharges in adult hippocampal CA3. This effect is only transiently observed if the seizure was induced in adult. It does not appear to be related to a change in GABAergic inhibition, in density of ACh innervation, or in ACh or GABA content.

The present investigation examined whether the mid-ventrolateral prefrontal cortex is selectively involved in active memory retrieval in situations in which mnemonic traces are embedded in ambiguous relations and automatic recollection cannot lead to successful retrieval. Thirteen subjects participated in this event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging experiment. Throughout the scanning session, trials belonging to an experimental and a control condition were administered in a pseudorandom fashion. During the encoding phase of any particular trial, subjects were presented with a stimulus-complex that was a combination of a face and a spatial location on the screen. In the experimental active retrieval condition, a question cue following the encoding phase instructed the subjects to retrieve selectively one of the two aspects of the encoded stimulus-complex, i.e. the face or the location. In the control condition, the question cue that followed the encoding phase instructed the subjects simply to recall the initially presented stimulus-complex, so as to be able to make a decision during the test phase based on simple stimulus familiarity. The comparison of the signal obtained during the retrieval phase of these two conditions yielded an increase in activity selective to the right mid-ventrolateral prefrontal region. These results therefore establish a specific link between the mid-ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and active retrieval mechanisms.

Treatment of microglia with supernatants from allo-antigen and myelin basic protein-specific Th1 cell lines augmented expression of cell surface molecules MHC class II, CD80, CD86, CD40, and CD54, enhanced the functional antigen-presenting cell capacity of microglia in a mixed lymphocyte reaction, and increased cytokine/chemokine secretion (TNFalpha, IL-6, and CXCL10/IP-10). These Th1-induced effects were not reproduced by interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) alone and were only incompletely blocked by anti-IFN-gamma antibody. Th2 cell supernatant treatments did not alter costimulatory/adhesion molecule expression or induce cytokine/chemokine production by microglia. Th2 treatment, furthermore, failed to reduce the induction observed in response to Th1 supernatants. Neither Th1 nor Th2 supernatants induced production of the neurotrophin molecules, nerve growth factor, or brain-derived neurotrophic factor. Our results suggest that soluble molecules released by Th1 and not Th2 cells that infiltrate the CNS can stimulate resident microglia to acquire enhanced effector and accessory cell functions; the Th1-induced effects were not downregulated by Th2 supernatant-mediated bystander suppression.

Upon detecting that the categorization of a new input pattern is ambiguous, the input is postponed for a predefined time, after which it is reexamined and categorized for good. This approach is shown to improve the categorization performance over purely sequential processing, while yielding a shorter input response time, or latency, than batch processing. In order to examine the response time of processing schemes, the latency of a typical implementation is derived and compared to lower bounds. Gaussian and softmax models are derived from reject option theory and are considered for detecting ambiguity and triggering pattern postponement. The average latency and Rand Adjusted clustering score of reordered, sequential, and batch processing are compared through computer simulation using two unsupervised competitive learning neural networks and a radar pulse data set.

Method: Neuropsychological and psychological tests, a symptom self-report questionnaire and haematological and cardiac measurements were gathered from 41 exposed workers and 42 unexposed workers in a chemical production plant yearly for 3 years. Results: The exposed workers presented significantly more acute symptoms of exposure (headache, vertigo, nausea, fatigue, cardiac palpitations, irritated or red eyes) than did the unexposed workers. However, only one chronic symptom was repeatedly and more significantly reported, namely trembling of the hands. No psychological or neuropsychological tests (reaction time, psychomotor, cognitive, chromatopsia, Profile of Mood States) differentiated the two groups. However, acute effects of exposure on plasma creatinine and on systolic pressure were noted. Low creatinine levels in the plasma of exposed workers correlated significantly with impairment of mood on the Profile of Mood States test, but not with any other measure. We recommend that workers exposed to sodium azide be assessed with tremometry, clinically and in a future field study.

Changes in relaxation-mental ease and absorption, produced by standard hypnotic procedures, are further associated with changes in brain activity within structures critically involved in the basic representation of the body-self and the regulation of states of consciousness. The combination of experiential and modern brain imaging methods offers a unique perspective on hypnotic phenomena and provides new observations consistent with the proposition that hypnosis is an altered state of consciousness.

We examined 12 self-reported disease conditions including diabetes mellitus (types I or 2), nephrolithiasis, hypertension, heart attack, rheumatoid arthritis, thyroid disease, breast cancer, inflammatory bowel disease, neuromuscular disease, Paget's disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Multivariate linear and logistic regression analyses were performed to determine whether there were associations among these disease conditions and bone mineral density of the lumbar spine, femoral neck, and trochanter, as well as prevalent vertebral deformities. Bone mineral density measurements were higher in women and men with type 2 diabetes compared with those without after appropriate adjustments. The differences were most notable at the lumbar spine (+0.053 g/cm(2)), femoral neck (+0.028 g/cm(2)), and trochanter (+0.025 g/cm(2)) in women, and at the femoral neck (+0.025 g/cm(2)) in men. Hypertension was also associated with higher bone mineral density measurements for both women and men. The differences were most pronounced at the lumbar spine (+0.022 g/cm(2)) and femoral neck (+0.007 g/cm(2)) in women and at the lumbar spine (+0.028 g/cm(2)) in men. Although results were statistically inconclusive, men reporting versus not reporting past nephrolithiasis appeared to have clinically relevant lower bone mineral density values. Bone mineral density differences were -0.022, -0.015, and -0.016 g/cm(2) at the lumbar spine, femoral neck, and trochanter, respectively. Disease conditions were not strongly associated with vertebral deformities. In summary, these cross-sectional population-based data show that type 2 diabetes and hypertension are associated with higher bone mineral density in women and men, and nephrolithiasis may be associated with lower bone mineral density in men. The importance of these associations for osteoporosis case finding and management require further and prospective studies.

MANF selectively protects nigral dopaminergic neurons, versus GABAergic or serotonergic neurons. The discovery of MANF marks a more systematic approach in the search for astrocyte-derived, secreted proteins that selectively protect specific neuronal phenotypes. Compared to glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) , MANF was more selective in the protection of dopaminergic neurons at lower (0.05-0.25 ng/mL) and middle (0.5-2.5 ng/mL) concentrations: MANF>GDNF>BDNE GDNF was more selective at higher concentrations (25-50 ng/ml): GDNF>MANF>BDNF. Two domains in MANF of 39-AA and 109-AA respectively, and eight cysteines are conserved from C. elegans to man. MANF is encoded by a 4.3 Kb gene with 4 exons, and is located on the short arm of human chromosome 3. The secondary structure is dominated by alpha-helices (47%) and random coils (37%). Studies to determine the localization of MANF in the brains of rat, monkey, and man, as well as the receptor, signaling pathways, and biologically active peptide mimetics are in progress. The selective, neuroprotective effect of MANF for dopaminergic neurons suggests that it may be indicated for the treatment of Parkinson's disease.

In contrast, the overexpression of human neurofilament heavy (NF-H) proteins provoked the formation of massive perikaryal IF protein accumulations with no loss of motor neurons. To further investigate the toxic properties of IF protein inclusions, we generated NF-L null mice thatco-express both peripherin and NF-H transgenes. The axonal count in L5 ventral roots from 6 and 8-month-old transgenic mice showed that NF-H overexpression rescued the peripherin-mediated degeneration of motor neurons. Our analysis suggests that the protective effect of extra NF-H proteins is related to the sequestration of peripherin into the perikaryon of motor neurons, thereby abolishing the development of axonal IF inclusions that might block transport. These findings illustrate the importance of IF protein stoichiometry in formation, localization and toxicity of neuronal inclusion bodies.

They were significantly (p < 0.05) increased in the frontal (50%) and parietal (40%) cortices, superior olive (over 30%), and the substantia nigra (30%) in the OBX rats as compared to the sham operated animals. There were also increases in 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) synthesis in some limbic areas: the cingulate (32%), the medial forebrain bundle (58%), the hippocampus (13-25%) and the thalamus (22-40%). The largest increase in 5-HT synthesis after OBX was observed in the sensory-motor cortex (67%). 5-HT synthesis rates were significantly decreased in the dorsal and medial raphe nuclei, but there was no significant change the ventral tegmental area and the locus coeruleus following OBX. These results indicate that olfactory bulbectomy causes an imbalance in 5-HT synthesis in some projection areas by disproportionally increasing 5-HT synthesis rates in specific brain regions and making more 5-HT available for neurotransmission. This imbalance in 5-HT synthesis and the subsequent elevation of tissue 5-HT may be responsible for the creation of non-physiological circuitry which may, in part, be reflected in the symptoms resembling human depression.

In this study we evaluated the molecular mechanisms that regulate passage of ex vivo peripheral blood-derived monocytes across this barrier and the effects of such migration on the properties of both the HBECs and the monocytes. Our results indicate that monocytes can migrate across HBECs in the absence of inflammatory conditions, at rates exceeding those of lymphocytes. Monocyte migration could be significantly inhibited by the addition of blocking antibodies to intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1, very late antigen (VLA)-4 integrin, and monocyte chemoattractant protein (CCL-2/MCP-1), or treatment with tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP-1). Following monocyte migration there was a significant increase in permeability of soluble molecules and an enhanced rate of T cell migration across HBECs. The enhanced permeability could he partially presented with anti-TNF-alpha antibody. The migration process did not induce the upregulation of either co-stimulatory molecules or chemokine receptors on the monocytes. These studies emphasize the functional role of monocyte-endothelial interactions in permitting target access of a CNS-directed cell-mediated immune response.

J	Kourrich, S; Chapman, CA				Kourrich, S; Chapman, CA			NMDA receptor-dependent long-term synaptic depression in the entorhinal cortex in vitro	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article							HIPPOCAMPUS IN-VIVO; METABOTROPIC GLUTAMATE RECEPTORS; LOW-FREQUENCY STIMULATION; FREELY MOVING RAT; GUINEA-PIG BRAIN; DENTATE GYRUS; AREA CA1; SENSORIMOTOR CORTEX; ADULT HIPPOCAMPUS; PYRAMIDAL CELLS	The entorhinal cortex receives a large projection from the piriform ( primary olfactory) cortex and, in turn, provides the hippocampal formation with most of its cortical sensory input. Synaptic plasticity in this pathway may therefore affect the processing of olfactory information and memory encoding. We have recently found that long-term synaptic depression (LTD) can be induced in this pathway in vivo by repetitive paired-pulse stimulation but not by low-frequency (1 Hz) stimulation with single pulses. Here, we have used field potential recordings to investigate the stimulation parameters and transmitter receptors required for the induction of LTD in the rat entorhinal cortex in vitro. The effectiveness of low-frequency stimulation (900 pulses at 1 or 5 Hz) and repeated delivery of pairs of stimulation pulses (30-ms interpulse interval) was assessed. Only repeated paired-pulse stimulation resulted in lasting LTD, and a low-intensity paired-pulse stimulation protocol that induces LTD in vivo was only effective in the presence of the GABA(A) receptor antagonist bicuculline (50 muM). LTD could also be induced in normal ACSF, however, by increasing the number of pulse-pairs delivered and by increasing the stimulation intensity during LTD induction. The induction of LTD was blocked by constant bath application of the N-methyl-D-aspartate ( NMDA) glutamate receptor antagonist D-2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate (50 muM), indicating that LTD is dependent on NMDA receptor activation. However, LTD was not blocked by the group I/II mGluR antagonist (RS)-alpha-ethyl-4-carboxyphenylglycine (500 muM) or by bicuculline (50 muM). The induction of LTD in the entorhinal cortex in vitro is therefore dependent on intense stimulation that recruits activation of NMDA receptors, but does not require concurrent activation of mGluRs or inhibitory synaptic inputs.

The TUC proteins are expressed in newly born neurons in the developing nervous system and have been implicated in semaphorin signaling and neuronal polarity. Here, we identify several new variants of the TUC family, each of which is expressed during distinct periods of neural development. We cloned and characterized TUC-4b, a variant of TUC-4a that includes a unique N-terminal extension. The functional relevance of this N-terminal domain is demonstrated by the finding that overexpression of TUC-4b, but not TUC-4a, results in increased neurite length and branching. Furthermore, whereas TUC-4a is expressed throughout life, TUC-4b is expressed exclusively during embryonic development. TUC-4b is localized to SV2 (synaptic vesicle protein 2)-positive vesicles in the central domain of the growth cone, suggesting a potential role in growth cone vesicle transport. Furthermore, TUC-4b interacts with the SH3A (Src homology 3A) domain of intersectin, an endocytic-exocytic adaptor protein. Together, these data suggest that TUC-4b can regulate neurite extension and branching through a mechanism that may involve membrane transport in the growth cone.

Pathological symptom attributions, personality traits, and depression have all been hypothesized to contribute to illness worry. Methods: We compared 45 chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) and 40 multiple selerosis(MS) outpatients using a battery of psychometric instruments comprising the 12-item Illness Worry scale, the Symptom Interpretation Questionnaire (SIQ), the NEO Five-Factor Inventory (NEO-FFI), and a modified version of the SCL-90R Depression scale. Results: There was no difference between the two diagnostic groups on neuroticism, depressive symptoms, as well as the three scales of the SIQ. On the illness worry index, the CFS group had significantly higher scores than the MS group. This difference was due to items tapping vulnerability to illness and the perception that others are not taking their illness seriously. Somatic attributional style, neuroticism, depressive symptoms, And age were all significant predictors of illness worry in both CFS and MS patients. Conclusions: Somatic attributions, neuroticism, and depression all contribute to illness worry in chronic illness. However, these factors do not account for the higher levels of illness worry in CFS as opposed to MS, which may be due to other specific cognitive and social interactional processes.

Nevertheless, many patients are still alive with their prosthesis in place. We evaluated the ability of transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) to detect cloth tear in 9 asymptomatic patients operated on with a cloth-covered Starr-Edwards aortic valve at our institution. An echogenic mobile structure attached to the prosthesis, suggestive of a tear, was detected in 5 patients (55%). A tear was diagnosed in a sixth patient when TEE was repeated during follow-up because of neurologic symptoms. in all cases, transthoracic echocardiography failed to detect any abnormality. Two patients had symptoms develop and underwent reoperation; cloth tear was more extensive than suspected by TEE. Cloth tear is a frequent finding that can he detected by TEE in asymptomatic patients with cloth-covered Starr-Edwards aortic prosthesis. TEE is recommended in these patients and reoperation should be considered as soon as symptoms appear.

Using a positional cloning approach, we have mapped and isolated the gl locus from a similar to1.5 cM genetic interval. The gl locus was identified in a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) contig by functional genetic complementation in transgenic mice. Genomic sequence analysis revealed that the gl mutation is a deletion resulting in complete loss of function. The unique similar to3 kb wild-type transcript is expressed primarily in osteoclasts and melanocytes as well as in brain, kidney, thymus and spleen. The gl gene is predicted to encode a 338-amino acid type I transmembrane protein that localizes to the intracellular compartment. Mutation in the human GL gene leads to severe recessive osteopetrosis. Our studies show that mouse Gl protein function is absolutely required for osteoclast and melanocyte maturation and function.

Its deeper layers contain a retinotopically organized motor map in which each site is thought to encode a specific gaze saccade vector. Here we show that this fundamental assumption in current models of collicular function does not hold true during horizontal multi-step gaze shifts in darkness that are directed to a goal and composed of a sequence of gaze saccades separated by periods of steady fixation. At the start of a muiti-step gaze shift in cats, neural activity on the SC's map was located caudally to encode the overall amplitude of the gaze displacement, not the first saccade in the sequence. As the gaze shift progressed, the locus of activity moved to encode the error between the goal and the current gaze position. Contrary to common belief, the locus of activity never encoded gaze saccade amplitude, except for the last saccade in the sequence.

The proposed scheme belongs to a class of structure level adaptation algorithms that adds both new hidden units and new hidden layers one at a time when it is determined to be needed. Using this strategy, a FNN may be constructed having as many hidden layers and hidden units as required by the complexity of the problem being considered. Simulation results applied to regression problems are included to demonstrate the performance capabilities of the proposed scheme. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Perisynaptic Schwann cells, which are glial cells at the neuromuscular junction, have proven to be an exceptionally useful model for studying these roles. Recent studies have shown that they detect and reciprocally modulate synaptic efficacy in an activity-dependent manner in the short term. In addition, perisynaptic Schwann cells guide reinnervating nerve sprouts after deinnervation, and many important parameters of this are dependent on synapse activity. Thus, it is hypothesized that perisynaptic Schwann cells are key integrators in a continuum of synaptic efficacy, stability, and plasticity at the neuromuscular junction, which is important for maintaining and restoring synaptic efficacy.

Treatment of high-grade gliomas has been frustrating, with less than 5% of patients surviving 5 years after a diagnosis of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) and fractionated strereotactic radiotherapy (F-SRT) provide means to either escalate the dose in primary treatment or to palliate recurrences. Because of their lower alpha/beta ratios and more focal nature, low-grade gliomas (LGG) are more attractive targets for stereotactically focused radiation. Results of available phase I-II data are reviewed for both low and high-grade gliomas. In the case of high-grade gliomas disappointing preliminary phase III data from RTOG 93-05 are discussed. Toxicity of SRS is discussed. Acute treatment toxicity of significance is unusual and generally self-limited. Occasionally an exacerbation of existing symptoms occurs. Late complications attributable to SRS are usually defined as necrosis within the treatment volume. The rate of necrosis can be hard to define in high-grade gliomas as tumor cells are often present in surgical specimens. New strategies in the application of stereotactic radiation are touched upon, these include: changes in planning and fractionation, concurrent use of chemotherapy, use of radiation modifiers and biologic agents. After reviewing the current data for high-grade gliomas, it appears that any apparent improvement in outcome seen in phase I-II trials is attributable to patient selection. The best evidence available does not support the use of SRS for primary high-grade gliomas. The somewhat limited experience in LGG also indicates a lack of benefit for patients treated with stereotactic radiosurgery or F-SRT. For a very select group of patients with small recurrent lesions, F-SRT may represent a safe, reasonable treatment.

Several single and paired basic residues are present within its primary amino acid sequence comprising cleavage sites for prohormone convertases. In this study, SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells were stably transfected with the prohormone convertase PC2 to analyse the proteolytic processing of endogenous chromogranin A and, in particular, the formation of the chromogranin-A-derived peptide GE-25. Our analyses revealed a significant change in the pattern of proteolytic conversion of chromogranin A in cells expressing PC2. Mock-transfected control cells contained mainly the intact chromogranin A molecule and hardly any shorter products were found. On the other hand, PC2-transfected cells showed extensive processing of chromogranin A, resulting in significantly lower amounts of the intact precursor and especially high levels of the free peptide GE-25.

The extent of copper-catalyzed rHCaBP S-nitrosation depends on the ratio of protein to GSNO and on the reaction time, and NO-transfer is prevented when copper chelators are present. CuZnSOD is an efficient catalyst of rHCaBP S-nitrosation, and the mechanism of CuZnSOD-catalyzed S-nitrosation involves reduction of the active-site Cu-II by a number of the five free thiols in rHCaBP, giving rise to thiyl radicals. The (CuZnSOD)-Zn-I formed catalyzes the reductive cleavage of GSNO present in solution to give GSH and release NO. rHCaBP thiyl radicals react with NO to yield the S-nitrosoprotein. (CuZnSOD)-Zn-II is also reduced by GSH in a concentration-dependent manner up to 5 mM but not at higher GSH concentrations. However, unlike the rHCaBP thiyl radicals, GS(.) radicals dimerize to GSSG faster than their reaction with NO. The data presented here provide a biologically relevant mechanism for protein S-nitrosation by small S-nitrosothiols. S-nitrosation is rapidly gaining recognition as a major form of protein posttranslational modification, and the efficient S-nitrosation of CaBP by CuZnSOD/GSNO is speculated to be of neurochemical importance given that CaBP and CuZnSOD are abundant in neurons.

Data on symptom severity (PANSS), mothers' personality (NEO-PI), subjective burden (SBAS), and Expressed Emotion (CFI) were gathered from 41 schizophrenia outpatients and their mothers. Approximately one quarter of the variance in Critical Comments (CCs) and Emotional Overinvolvement (EOI) was explained using path analysis. Mothers' CCs were associated with more severe excitement in the patient, with lower Neuroticism, and greater burden in the mother. Higher EOI was explained by greater Conscientiousness and burden in the mother; patient depression had a weak indirect effect on maternal EOI. These results characterize the high EE mother as low in neuroticism and high in conscientiousness with a particular sensitivity to excitement and depression in the patient.

This role is subserved by cholinergic neurons but also requires the participation of other noncholinergic neurons. Noncholinergic neurons include gamma-amino butyric acidergic (GABAergic) neurons, some of which project in parallel with the cholinergic cells to the cerebral cortex, others of which project caudally or locally. With the original aim of distinguishing different subgroups of GABAergic neurons, we examined immunostaining for the calcium binding proteins (CBPs) parvalbumin (Parv), calbindin (Calb), and calretinin (Calret) in the rat. Although the CBP+ cell groups were distributed in a coextensive manner with the GABAergic cells, they were collectively more numerous. Of cells retrogradely labeled with cholera toxin (CT) from the prefrontal or parietal cortex, Parv(+) and Calb(+) cells, but not Calret(+) cells, represented substantial proportions (similar to35-45% each) that collectively were greater than that of GABAergic projection neurons. From dual immunostaining for the CBPs and glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), it appeared that the vast majority (>90%) of the Parv(+) group was GAD(+), whereas only a small minority (<10%) of the Calb(+) or Calret(+) group was GAD(+). Significant proportions of Calb(+) (>40%) and Calret+ (>80%) neurons were immunopositive for phosphate-activated glutaminase, the synthetic enzyme for transmitter glutamate. The results suggested that, whereas Calret(+) cells predominantly comprise caudally or locally projecting, possibly glutamatergic BF neurons, Parv(+) cells likely comprise the cortically projecting GABAergic BF neurons and Calb(+) cells the cortically projecting, possibly glutamatergic BF neurons that would collectively participate with the cholinergic cells in the modulation of cortical activity.

L1 is proteolytically processed at two distinct sites within the extracellular domain, leading to the generation of different fragments. In this report, we present evidence that the proprotein convertase PC5A is the protease that cleaves L1 in the third fibronectin type III domain, whereas the proprotein convertases furin, PC1, PC2, PACE4, and PC7 are not effective in cleaving L1. Analysis of mutations revealed Arg(845) to be the site of cleavage generating the N-terminal 140-kDa fragment. This fragment was present in the hippocampus, which expresses PC5A, but was not detectable in the cerebellum, which does not express PC5A. The 140-kDa L1 fragment was found to be tightly associated with the full-length 200-kDa L1 molecule. The complex dissociated from the membrane upon cleavage by a protease acting at a more membrane-proximal site of full-length L1. This proteolytic cleavage was inhibited by the metalloprotease inhibitor GM 6001 and enhanced by a calmodulin inhibitor. L1-dependent neurite outgrowth of cerebellar neurons was inhibited by GM 6001, suggesting that proteolytic processing of L1 by a metalloprotease is involved in neurite outgrowth.

Mouse peripherin is unique compared with other nIF proteins in that three peripherin isoforms are generated by alternative splicing. Here, the properties of the peripherin splice variants Per 58, Per 56, and Per 61 have been investigated in transfected cell lines, in primary motor neurons, and in transgenic mice overexpressing peripherin or overexpressing SOD1G37R. Of the three isoforms, Per 61 proved to be distinctly neurotoxic, being assembly incompetent and inducing degeneration of motor neurons in culture. Using isoform-specific antibodies, Per 61 expression was detected in motor neurons of SOD1(G37R) transgenic mice but not of control or peripherin transgenic mice. The Per 61 antibody also selectively labeled motor neurons and axonal spheroids in two cases of familial ALS and immuno-precipitated a higher molecular mass peripherin species from disease tissue. This evidence suggests that expression of neurotoxic splice variants of peripherin may contribute to the neurodegenerative mechanism in ALS.

Indeed, a chronic incapacity to suppress negative emotion might be a key factor in the genesis of depression and anxiety. Regarding the neural underpinnings of emotional self-regulation, a recent functional neuroimaging study carried out by our group has revealed that the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and anterior cingulate cortex are involved in voluntary suppression of sexual arousal. As few things are known, still, with respect to the neural substrate underlying volitional self-regulation of basic emotions, here we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to identify the neural circuitry associated with the voluntary suppression of sadness. Methods: Twenty healthy female subjects were scanned during a Sad condition and a Suppression condition. In the Sad condition, subjects were instructed to react normally to sad film excerpts whereas, in the Suppression condition, they were asked to voluntarily suppress any emotional reaction in response to comparable stimuli. Results: Transient sadness was associated with significant loci of activation in the anterior temporal pole and the midbrain, bilaterally, as well as in the left amygdala, left insula, and right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) (Brodmann area [BA] 47). Correlational analyses carried out between self-report ratings of sadness and regional blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal changes revealed the existence of positive correlations in the right VLPFC (BA 47), bilaterally, as well as in the left insula and the affective division of the left anterior cingulate gyrus (BA 24/32). In the Suppression condition, significant loci of activation were noted in the right DLPFC (BA 9) and the right orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) (BA 11), and positive correlations were found between the self-report ratings of sadness and BOLD signal changes in the right OFC (BA 11) and right DLPFC (BA 9). Conclusions: These results confirm the key role played by the DLPFC in emotional self-regulation. They also indicate that the right DLPFC and right OFC are components of a neural circuit implicated in voluntary suppression of sadness. (C) 2003 Society of Biological Psychiatry.

Thus, AMF internalization requires a caveolae-mediated endocytic pathway. Similarly, we show here that endocytosis of cholera toxin (CTX) in NIH-3T3 fibroblasts is inhibited by adenoviral expression of the dynamin-1 K44A mutant but only partially by expression of the clathrin hub. Treatment with methyl-beta-cyclodextrin and overexpression of caveolin-1, but not the clathrin hub, selectively diminishes CTX endocytosis to the Golgi apparatus but not to endosomes. CTX is therefore targeted via a caveolin-1-regulated caveolae-mediated pathway to the Golgi. Disruption of Golgi-, caveosome- or endosome-mediated trafficking with brefeldin A, nocodazole or a 20degreesC temperature block, respectively, inhibit CTX endocytosis to the Golgi but do not affect AMF delivery to the endoplasmic reticulum. Following an incubation of only five minutes in the presence of the clathrin hub, AMF and CTX are not cointernalized, and AMF is delivered to the AMF-R-positive smooth ER. The internalization of both ligands is nevertheless sensitive to the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein, confirming that they are both internalized via caveolae/raft pathways. Two distinct caveolae-mediated endocytic pathways therefore exist, including a novel direct pathway to the ER from the plasma membrane.

However, the spindle afferents of jaw-closing muscles behave as if action potential traffic along their central axons is phasically regulated during rhythmic jaw movements. In this paper, we used brainstem slices containing the cell bodies, stem axons, and central axons of these sensory afferents to show that GABA applied to the descending central ( caudal) axon often abolished antidromic action potentials that were elicited by electrical stimulation of the tract containing the caudal axons of the recorded cells. This effect of GABA was most often not associated with a change in membrane potential of the soma and was still present in a calcium-free medium. It was mimicked by local applications of muscimol on the axons and was blocked by bath applications of picrotoxin, suggesting activation of GABA(A) receptors located on the descending axon. Antidromic action potentials could also be blocked by electrical stimulation of local interneurons, and this effect was prevented by bath application of picrotoxin, suggesting that it results from the activation of GABA(A) receptors after the release of endogenous GABA. We suggest that blockage is caused mainly by shunting within the caudal axon and that motor command circuits use this mechanism to disconnect the rostral and caudal compartments of the central axon, which allows the two parts of the neuron to perform different functions during movement.

After our recent report that a deregulation of Cdk5 activity by p25 may contribute to pathogenesis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), we further examined the possible involvement of other Cdks in mice expressing a mutant form of superoxide dismutase (SOD1(G37R)) linked to ALS. No substantial changes in Cdk2 or Cdk6 distribution and kinase activities were detected in spinal motor neurons from SOD1(G37R) mice when compared with normal mice. Of particular interest was the upregulation and mislocalization of Cdk4, a regulator of the G(1)-S checkpoint of the cell cycle, in motor neurons of SOD1(G37R) mice. The increase of Cdk4 activity in SOD1(G37R) mice was associated with an increase in nuclear Cdk4, cyclin D1, its coactivator, and with the abnormal phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma (Rb) protein at Cdk phosphorylation sites. Pharmacological treatment of SOD1(G37R) mice with minocycline, a compound that attenuates microgliosis and slows down disease, lessened the dysregulation of Cdk5/Cdk4 and the phosphorylation of Rb. Interestingly, phospho-Rb was immunoprecipitated with anti-Cdk4 but not with anti-Cdk5 antibodies, suggesting a key role for Cdk4 in the phosphorylation of Rb. Remarkably, the overexpression of a transgene coding for human neurofilament H, a phosphorylation sink for deregulated Cdk5 activity by p25, resulted in a reduction in levels of nuclear Cdk4 and Rb phosphorylation. These results indicate that a cell cycle signaling at the neuronal G(1)-S checkpoint subsequent to Cdk5 deregulation may constitute a critical step of the neuronal death pathway in ALS caused by mutant SOD1.

We used in vivo and in vitro models to identify a novel role for glutamate in striatal neurogenesis mediated by NMDA receptors. In utero exposure to NMDA receptor antagonists during striatal neurogenesis caused a dramatic reduction in the total number of adult striatal neurons. In contrast, embryos exposed to NMDA receptor antagonists immediately after the main period of neurogenesis showed no significant change in neuronal number in the adult striatum. In addition, examination of embryos shortly after NMDA receptor blockade revealed reduced proliferation in the lateral ganglionic eminence (LGE). In culture, dividing neuronal progenitors derived from the embryonic LGE showed marked reduction in 5'-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) uptake when exposed to NMDA receptor antagonists, indicating reduced DNA synthesis. Low concentrations of NMDA significantly increased proliferation, whereas high concentrations were toxic. AMPA-KA receptor antagonists had no significant effect on striatal neuroblast proliferation either in vivo or in vitro. These results support the hypothesis that glutamate plays a novel role during early development of the ventral telencephalon, promoting proliferation of striatal neuronal progenitors by an NMDA receptor-dependent mechanism. In contrast, previous findings suggest that proliferation of cortical progenitors derived from the dorsal telencephalon is regulated by activation of AMPA-KA but not NMDA receptors. Heterogeneous responses to glutamate in different germinal zones of the telencephalon may be an important mechanism contributing to generating neuronal diversity in the forebrain.

The results show that the two locomotor modes exhibited by salamanders (i.e., stepping and swimming) were evoked by electrical microstimulation (5-15 Hz; 0.1-10 muA; 2 msec pulses) of a circumscribed region in the caudal mesencephalon. At threshold current strength (0.5-3.5 muA at 15 Hz), rhythmic limb movements and intersegmental coordination, such as during stepping, were induced. As the stimulation strength was subsequently increased, the frequency of stepping became more rapid, and, at 2.0-5.5 muA, the limbs were held back against the body wall and swimming movements of the trunk were induced. An additional increase of the stimulation strength induced an increase of the frequency and amplitude of the swimming movements. Anatomical studies conducted in parallel revealed the presence of choline acetyltransferase immunoreactive cells in the functionally identified MLR region. Together, the present results indicate that the MLR is present in salamanders and that its level of activation determines the mode of locomotion. Walking is induced at low activation levels, and swimming, which constitutes a faster mode of locomotion, requires stronger stimulation of the MLR. Furthermore, as in other vertebrates, the MLR contains cholinergic cells.

Methods: The authors studied 14 patients with intractable TLE by PET using alpha-[C-11] methyl-L-tryptophan (alpha-MTrp) and 2-[F-18]-fluoro-deoxy-glucose (FDG) and compared results with 21 healthy control subjects who had alpha-MTrp PET studies. Seven patients had unilateral hippocampal atrophy (HA), and seven had normal hippocampal volumes (NV). The regional uptake constant (K*) for alpha-MTrp and regional FDG uptake were calculated in regions with high serotonergic innervation, including the hippocampus, amygdala, lateral temporal lobe, frontal lobe, thalamus, lenticular nucleus, and cingulate cortex. Results: A significant increase of alpha-MTrp uptake was observed in the hippocampus ipsilateral to the seizure focus in seven TLE patients with NV compared to seven patients with HA as well as to healthy controls. In patients with TLE, glucose utilization in the lateral temporal lobe ipsilateral to the seizure focus was correlated negatively with K* for alpha-MTrp in the ipsilateral hippocampus and positively with K* in the ipsilateral lenticular nucleus and cingulate cortex. Glucose utilization in the frontal lobe ipsilateral to the seizure shows a reduction in the glucose utilization which relates to the increase in the alpha-MTrp uptake in the ipsilateral lateral temporal lobe. Conclusion: This study demonstrates dysfunction of the serotonergic system, which could include metabolism through the kynurenine pathway in TLE patients with normal hippocampal volumes. alpha-MTrp PET studies might be useful for lateralizing the epileptic focus in TLE patients with normal hippocampal volumes.

J	Oriet, C; Stevanovski, B; Jolicoeur, P				Oriet, C; Stevanovski, B; Jolicoeur, P			Congruency-induced blindness: a cost-benefit analysis	ACTA PSYCHOLOGICA			English	Article						blindness effect; baseline; visual perception; motor processes	RESPONSE-COMPATIBLE STIMULI	Targets are identified more accurately when they are presented during an incongruent response (e.g., a left-pointing arrowhead presented during a right key press) than during a congruent response (e.g., a left-pointing arrowhead presented during a left key press). This effect, referred to here as congruency-induced blindness, has been hypothesised to result from the occupation of feature codes. According to the code occupation hypothesis (Behav. Brain Sci.; J. Experim. Psychol.: Human Percept. Perform.; Vis. Cogn., in press), only costs of congruency between features of a planned or executed action and a to-be-perceived target should be observed; neither costs nor benefits of incongruency are predicted by this account. In the present study, we investigated costs and benefits in identifying left and right targets directly by manipulating neutral response type and the symbols used to cue the neutral response, which produced four neutral conditions. Three important results emerged: (1) a significant main effect of RSI (suggesting that increasing temporal overlap between a planned action and target presentation interferes with perceptual reports of the target), (2) a significant main effect of congruency (showing that impairment is code-specific), and (3) clear-cut costs with little evidence for benefits. Other complex patterns of results provided additional information relevant for extant theories of perception-action interactions. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The effects of continuous and constant treatment with ethanol on the rates of serotonin [5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)] synthesis in discrete regions of the rat brain were studied. Methods: 5-HT synthesis rates were measured using the alpha-[C-14]methyl-l-tryptophan autoradiographic method. The rats in the experimental group were treated with 50% ethyl alcohol and those in the control group received distilled water. The fluid was delivered subcutaneously by implanted osmotic mini-pumps for 14 days at the rate of 5 mul/h or 0.12 ml/day (0.06 ml of alcohol per day). Results: Chronic ethanol treatment, as delivered in the present experiment, induced a significant increase in the rate of 5-HT synthesis in descending serotonergic cell bodies (raphe pallidum, raphe obscurus, raphe magnus), nigrostriatal structures, the hippocampus and cortices. No significant changes were observed in the dorsal and median raphe nuclei or pineal body. The results suggest that there may be differences in the regulation of 5-HT synthesis in different brain structures after 14 days of continuous (subcutaneous) injection of 50% alcohol. Conclusions: Chronic ethanol treatments using osmotic mini-pumps induce non-uniform increases in 5-HT synthesis in the rat brain.

We hypothesized that the N-acetylaspartate (NAA)-creatine (Cr) ratios in the motor cortex and adjacent brain could reflect the therapeutic effectiveness of gabapentin (GBP) treatment in ALS. METHODS: Eight patients with ALS underwent MR spectroscopy before and 26.5 days +/-8.8 after starting GBP. In 10 patients with ALS who were not treated with GBP, paired spectra were obtained 21.4 days +/-7.2 apart. Fourteen healthy subjects underwent a single MR spectroscopic examination. The NAA/Cr ratio was measured in the precentral gyrus, the postcentral gyrus, the superior parietal lobule, the supplementary motor area, and the premotor cortex. RESULTS: The NAA/Cr ratio was decreased in the precentral and postcentral gyri of patients with ALS compared with healthy controls. In those with ALS, the change in the NAA/Cr ratio was not different between treated patients and untreated patients in any of the regions studied. CONCLUSION: No improvement in neuronal integrity was detected in motor and nonmotor cerebral regions after GBP treatment. This result agrees with that of prior investigations showing the equivocal clinical effectiveness of GBP for ALS and supports the validity of the NAA/Cr ratio as a surrogate of therapeutic effectiveness.

A group of exercise-trained rats and a control group (no training) were examined after a 4-wk experimental period. Exercise training elicited an approximate fourfold rise in gastrocnemius NOS activity and augmented protein expression of the endothelial (eNOS) and neuronal (nNOS) isoforms of NOS to similar to480% and 240%, respectively. Qualitatively similar but quantitatively smaller elevations in NOS activity and eNOS and nNOS expression were observed in the diaphragm. No detectable inducible NOS (iNOS) protein expression was found in any of the muscle samples. Training increased the intensity of 3-nitrotyrosine only in the gastrocnemius muscle. We conclude that whole body exercise training enhances both limb and ventilatory muscle NO production and that constitutive and not iNOS isoforms are responsible for increased protein tyrosine nitration in trained limb muscles.

The authors' goal was to examine whether healthy siblings of patients with childhood-onset schizophrenia show structural brain abnormalities and the age-related pattern of abnormalities seen in patients with childhood-onset schizophrenia. Method: Anatomic brain MRI scans were obtained from 15 psychiatrically healthy full siblings of 15 patients with childhood-onset schizophrenia and from 32 matched community volunteers. Automated measures were used to compare total and regional brain volumes of the siblings and volunteers. Results: Siblings of patients with childhood-onset schizophrenia had smaller total cerebral volume and total, frontal, and parietal gray matter volumes than volunteers. When divided into younger and older groups, younger siblings had smaller parietal gray matter volumes and older siblings showed trends for smaller total and frontal gray matter volumes. Conclusions: Healthy siblings of patients with childhood-onset schizophrenia share brain MRI abnormalities with the patients that may follow a similar pattern of progression. Developmental brain abnormalities in childhood-onset schizophrenia may thus be genetic trait markers.

Hypotheses: High school athletes reporting headache approximately 1 week after injury will have significantly more other concussion symptoms and will perform more poorly on neuropsychological tests than athletes not experiencing headache. Study Design: Prospective cohort study. Methods: Study participants included 109 high school athletes who had sustained concussion and who were divided into two groups: those reporting headache 7 days after injury and those reporting no headaches. The two groups were compared regarding on-field markers of concussion severity at the time of injury and symptoms and neurocognitive test results collected via ImPACT, a computerized neuropsychological test battery and postconcussion symptom scale, at a mean of 6.8 days after injury. Results: Athletes reporting posttraumatic headache demonstrated significantly worse performance on reaction time and memory ImPACT neurocognitive composite scores. These athletes also reported significantly more symptoms other than headache and were more likely to have demonstrated on-field anterograde amnesia. Conclusions: Findings suggest that any degree of postconcussion headache in high school athletes 7 days after injury is likely associated with an incomplete recovery after concussion.

In birds, for example, the parvorder Passerida contains 3556 species while the Odontophorida contains only six species. This uneven distribution of species among bird groups is not a consequence of random branching patterns and therefore warrants an explanation. According to the behavioural drive hypothesis, behavioural innovation coupled with social transmission of the new skill to other members of the population may lead to accelerated rates of evolution, and could therefore account for differences in species richness. In this paper, we test the behavioural drive hypothesis by examining the link between behavioural flexibility and the number of species per taxon. We estimate flexibility with relative brain size and feeding innovation rate and predict that both will be positively associated with the number of species per taxon. Since the number of species at any given time results from a balance between speciation and extinction rates, we also examine the link between flexibility and the number of species threatened with extinction. We predict that the two flexibility correlates will be negatively associated with the number of species at risk. In simple regressions, both flexibility correlates were significantly associated with species number per taxon. However, only innovation rate remained in the final model. Relative brain weight dropped out of the multiple regression due to its association with innovation rate. Relative brain weight, innovation rate and species number per taxon were all significantly correlated with the number of threatened species in the simple regression, but only the latter remained significant in the final model. The same results were obtained on independent contrasts, indicating that behavioural flexibility predicts richness but not extinction risk in birds.

A morphometric analysis of the male reproductive system of 37 days old mice revealed that prosaposin ablation produced a 30 % reduction in size and weight of the testes, 37 % of the epididymis, 75 % of the seminal vesicles and 60 % of the prostate glands. Light microscopy (LM) showed that smaller testis size from homozygous mutant mice was associated with reduced spermiogenesis. Both, dorsal and ventral lobules of the prostate glands were underdeveloped in the homozygous mutant. LM analysis also showed that prostatic alveoli were considerably smaller and lined by shorter epithelial cells in the homozygous mutant. Smaller tubular diameter and shorter undifferentiated epithelial cells were also observed in seminal vesicles and epididymis. In the efferent ducts of the homozygous mutant mice, the epithelium was composed exclusively of ciliated cells in contrast to the heterozygotes, which showed the presence of nonciliated cells. Radioimmunoassays demonstrated that testosterone levels were normal or higher in mice with the inactivated prosaposin gene. Immunostaining of prostate sections with an anti-androgen receptor antibody showed that the epithelial cells lining the alveoli express androgen receptor in both the heterozygous and homozygous tissue. Similarly, sections immunostained with antibodies to the phosphorylated MAPKs and Akts strongly reacted with tall prostatic secretory cells in prostate from heterozygous mouse. On the other hand, the epithelial cells in the homozygous prostate remained unstained or weakly stained. These findings demonstrate that inactivation of the prosaposin gene affected the development of the prostate gland and some components of the MAPK pathway.

Recent data suggest that the brain may play an important role in the pathophysiology of IBS in the brain-gut axis. It is strongly suspected that serotonin (5-HT), a neurotransmitter found in the brain and gut, may be related to the pathophysiotogy of IBS. It is reported that a 5-HT3 antagonist is effective only in female patients with diarrhea-predominant IBS. OBJECTIVE: In the present study, 5-HT synthesis was measured using positron emission tomography, with alpha-[C-11]methyl-L-tryptophan as the tracer, in patients with IBS. The aim of the present study was to compare 5-HT synthesis in the IBS patients with that in the controls, and to compare 5-HT synthesis between male and female IBS patients. METHODS: Six male and six female nonconstipated IBS patients were scanned. Age-matched healthy volunteers were scanned as controls. Eighty minute dynamic scans were performed. Functional 5-HT synthesis images were analyzed using statistical parametric mapping. RESULTS: 5-HT synthesis was greater only in the female IBS patients in the right medial temporal gyrus (multimodal sensory association cortex) compared with the female controls (P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The greater brain 5-HT synthesis in the female IBS patients than in the controls may be related to the pathological visceral pain processing of the IBS patients, a larger female predominance of the disorder, and the sex difference of the efficacy of the 5-HT 3 antagonist in treatment.

Among drug-induced movement disorders, antipsychotic drugs and other dopamine receptor blocking agents occupy a central place. Their various acute and tardive motor complications provide the template of this short review. Movement disorders caused by antidepressants, lithium, antiemetics, antiparkinsonian agents, anticonvulsants, calcium channel blockers, sympathomimetics and others are only briefly covered in table form.

This review examines the varied phenomenology of dystonias, its evolving classification including recent genetic data as well as its clinical investigation and treatment. Although age of onset, anatomical distribution and family history are key elements of the investigation of dystonia, classification increasingly relies on etiologic and genetic criteria. Physiological abnormalities in striato-cortical circuits are common in dystonia but the pathophysiology is still unclear. In recent years, a great deal has been learned on the more common primary dystonias such as primary torsion dystonia and on dystonia-plus syndromes such as dopamine responsive dystonia. Treatment of dystonia has also evolved and there are now a number of therapeutic agents with clear beneficial effects including anticholinergics, benzodiazepines, and botulinum toxin and there is growing interest in neurofunctional surgery including deep brain stimulation.

This is a very promising methodology that combines knowledge about neuronal activity and its metabolic response. The EEG recorded inside the fMRI scanner is, however, heavily contaminated by artifacts caused by the high intensity magnetic field and rapidly changing field gradients. Methods have been reported in the literature to reduce or eliminate these artifacts, in particular the ballistocardiogram and the artifact caused by currents induced by rapidly changing magnetic gradients. Nevertheless, recording the EEG simultaneously with fMRI remains an extremely delicate operation. In addition the use of artifact removal methods has only been reported by the laboratories in which they were developed. We report here the practical procedures we developed to reduce artifacts in a series of 10 epileptic patients, in the context of the visualization of epileptic spikes. We illustrate the effectiveness of methods designed to remove the scanning artifact and present new methods for removing the ballistocardiographic artifact. We present and evaluate techniques to obtain an EEG of good quality when performing simultaneous EEG and fMRI studies. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

The McGill Ingestive Skills Assessment (MISA) was developed to facilitate the reliable and valid bedside assessment of elderly persons with feeding difficulties. Items were generated by a literature review and selected with the collaboration of a multidisciplinary team. The first version of the MISA comprised 190 items in 7 scales, covering the domains of medical history, mealtime environment, physical characteristics of the patient, food textures consumed, solid ingestion, liquid ingestion, and behaviors related to self-feeding. The first field test for item selection included 50 individuals, aged 60 years and older, living in the community, supervised housing, and long-term care centers. After field testing, 134 items were eliminated due to poor face validity, redundancy, or poor psychometric performance. The remaining 56 items were provided with 4 response categories and were reorganized into 5 scales. The revised version was field tested to determine its preliminary psychometric properties on 33 individuals, 60 years of age and older, residing in a long-term care center. Six items were eliminated due to redundancy after the second field test. Analyses of the revised version resulted in the elimination of another 6 items that were redundant or that demonstrated poor reliability. Internal consistency of all scales is greater than or equal to0.86 and interrater agreement is greater than or equal to0.92. These analyses suggest that the psychometric properties of the MISA are adequate for diagnosis and treatment planning. This supports its readiness for clinical use following further reliability and validity testing with a larger sample.

Buffer pH was chosen to minimize purely electrostatic interactions between peptides and micelles that could not be interrogated by absorption spectroscopy. Viscosity-corrected MEKC mobilities gave reasonably similar estimates of K-as between the two methods for all three peptide-SDS micelle systems, with K-as values ranging from 13.7 +/- 0.3 to 49 +/- 1 M-1. For CTAB, estimates of K-as for LF-CTAB micelle association were of the same order of magnitude as the SDS micelle by the two methods of estimation. On the other hand, enkephalin-CTAB micelle binding was about 10 times stronger (K-as = 122 +/- 3 M-1 to 311 +/- 9 M-1) than the enkephalin-SDS micelle binding. In addition, MEKC underestimated the K-as values relative to spectroscopy by a factor of 2-3 for the enkephalin-CTAB system.

The ultradian rhythm of GH secretion is generated by the intricate patterned release of two hypothalamic hormones, somatostatin (SREF) and GHRH, acting both at the level of the pituitary gland and within the central nervous system. The recent discovery of ghrelin, a novel GH-releasing peptide identified as the endogenous ligand for the GH secretagogue receptor and shown to induce a positive energy balance, suggests the existence of an additional neuroendocrine pathway for GH control. To further understand how ghrelin interacts with the classical GBRH/SRIF neuronal system in GH regulation, we used a combined physiological and histochemical approach. Our physiological studies of the effects of ghrelin on spontaneous pulsatile GH secretion in conscious, free-moving male rats demonstrate that 1) ghrelin, administered either systemically or centrally, exerts potent, time-dependent GH-releasing activity under physiological conditions; 2) ghrelin is a functional antagonist of SRIF, but its GH-releasing activity at the pituitary level is not dependent on inhibiting endogenous SRIF release; 3) SRIF antagonizes the action of ghrelin at the level of the pituitary gland; and 4) the GH response to ghrelin in vivo requires an intact endogenous GHRH system. Our dual chromogenic and autoradiographic in situ hybridization experiments provide anatomical evidence that ghrelin may directly modulate GHRH mRNA- and neuropeptide Y mRNA-containing neurons in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus, but that SRIF mRNA-expressing cells are not major direct targets for ghrelin. Together, these findings support the idea that ghrelin may be a critical hormonal signal of nutritional status to the GH neuroendocrine axis serving to integrate energy balance and the growth process.

Methods: Study 1 evaluated 22 consecutively admitted patients whose antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) on admission to the Montreal Neurological Hospital included TPM. Performance on neuropsychological tests administered on and subsequently off TPM was analyzed. Four patients also were tested before taking TPM, allowing comparisons off, then on, and then off the drug again. Measures included intellectual function, verbal and nonverbal memory, language, word and design fluency, somatosensory sensitivity, and motor skills. In Study 2, 16 patients at the Minnesota Epilepsy Group were tested first off, then on TPM with nine cognitive tasks that measured concentration, verbal fluency, language, and psychomotor speed. Results: In Study 1, significant (p less than or equal to 0.01) improvements were observed off TPM on 13 measures including verbal and nonverbal fluency and certain verbal and perceptual tasks. Notably, verbal learning and memory were unaffected; a limited effect was observed on nonverbal memory. Patients tested 3 times scored better in both tests off TPM compared with on this drug. In Study 2, declines on TPM were observed on all measures, significantly (p less than or equal to 0.05) for tests of fluency, sustained concentration, and Visual motor processing speed. Conclusions: TPM was associated with declines in fluency, attention/concentration, processing speed, language skills, and perception; working memory but not retention was affected. As the two studies used an opposite order of testing on versus off TPM, our results clearly show a performance decrement while patients are taking TPM, without respect to which condition is tested first.

Methods: Thirteen children (aged 1.2-15.4 years) underwent prolonged intracranial EEG recording, using 48- to 120-channel subdural electrodes. Three distinct 10-min segments of the continuous interictal EEG recording were selected for each patient, and the spike frequency for each channel was determined by using an automatic spike-detection program. Subsequently the average spike frequency of each electrode was compared with ictal assessment (onset, spread, and no early ictal involvement). In addition, 50 distinct interictal spikes were averaged for each patient, and the amplitude and latency after the leading spike (averaged spike showing the earliest peak) were measured for each electrode and analyzed with respect to ictal EEG findings. Results: Reproducibility of the spike-frequency pattern derived from three 10-inin segments was high (Kendall's W, 0.85 +/- 0.08). Electrodes showing the highest spike frequency, the highest spike amplitude, and the leading spike were found to be a part of the seizure onset in 13 of 13, 12 of 13, and 10 of 13 cases, respectively. There was significant correlation between ictal assessment and spike frequency as well as spike amplitude. A receiver operating characteristics analysis showed that a cutoff threshold at 14% of the maximal spike frequency resulted in a specificity of 0.90 and a sensitivity of 0.77 for the detection of seizure-onset electrodes. Conclusions: Quantitative interictal subdural EEG may predict ictal-onset zones in children with intractable neocortical epilepsy.

The secreted form of ceruloplasmin is produced by the liver and is abundant in serum. We have previously identified a membrane-bound glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored form of ceruloplasmin (GPI-Cp) that is expressed by astrocytes in the central nervous system (CNS) (Patel and David. 1997. J Biol Chem 272:20185-20190). We now provide direct evidence that rat leptomeningeal cells, which cover the surface of the brain, also express GPI-Cp. The expression of GPI-Cp on the surface of these cells increases with postnatal development and is regulated in vitro by cell density, time in culture, and various extracellular matrix molecules. The expression of GPI-Cp also appears to be regulated differently in astrocytes and leptomeningeal cells in vitro. The abundant expression of GPI-Cp on the surface of leptomeningeal cells suggests that these cells play a role in antioxidant defense along the surface of the postnatal CNS possibly by detoxifying the cerebrospinal fluid.

Compared to controls, the experimental rats had a severe stunting in body growth. The effects on the dry and wet weights of the internal organs (kidney, lungs, brain, heart, liver, thymus, skeleton) differed between Hypoxic and LowCal, but were similar between sexes. Catch-up growth during the following weeks was more apparent in females than in males, and accompanied by increased oxygen consumption. At 1 and, especially, 3 months, the organs had almost recovered their original weights, although differences in protein and DNA content (measured in brain, lungs, heart, brown adipose tissue) were still present in some cases. In general, organ recovery was more apparent in LowCal than in Hypoxic, and in females than in males. In the experimental groups the unevenness in weight among organs (coefficient of variation of the individual weights relative to control) at 10 days, 1 month and 3 months correlated with the specific growth rate of the first, second and third month. This finding supports the possibility that inter-organ unevenness may represent an additional factor controlling the rate of catch-up growth.

We describe here the cloning and characterization of the avian orthologue of mammalian TLR4. Chicken TLR4 encodes a 843-amino-acid protein that contains a leucine-rich repeat extracellular domain, a short transmembrane domain typical of type I transmembrane proteins, and a Toll-interieukin-1R signaling domain characteristic of all TLR proteins. The chicken TLR4 protein shows 46% identity (64% similarity) to human TLR4 and 41% similarity to other TLR family members. Northern blot analysis reveals that TLR4 is expressed at approximately the same level in all tissues tested, including brain, thymus, kidney, intestine, muscle, liver, lung, bursa of Fabricius, heart, and spleen. The probe detected only one transcript of ca. 4.4 kb in length for all tissues except muscle where the size of TLR4 mRNA was ca. 9.6 kb. We have mapped TLR4 to microchromosome E41W17 in a region harboring the gene for tenascin C and known to be well conserved between the chicken and mammalian genomes. This region of the chicken genome was shown previously to harbor a Salmonella susceptibility locus. By using linkage analysis, TLR4 was shown to be linked to resistance to infection with Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium in chickens (likelihood ratio test of 10.2, P = 0.00138), suggesting a role of TLR4 in the host response of chickens to Salmonella infection.

J	Zghoul, T; Blier, P				Zghoul, T; Blier, P			Enhancing action of LSD on neuronal responsiveness to serotonin in a brain structure involved in obsessive-compulsive disorder	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NEUROPSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Hallucinogens; hippocampus; orbitofrontal cortex; 5-HT1A receptors; 5-HT2 receptors	ANTIDEPRESSANT TREATMENTS; ORBITOFRONTAL CORTEX; ACID DIETHYLAMIDE; RECEPTOR AGONIST; MAJOR DEPRESSION; KNOCKOUT MICE; HIPPOCAMPUS; HALLUCINOGENS; RESPONSES; RELIEF	Potent serotonin (5-HT) reuptake inhibitors are the only drugs that consistently exert a therapeutic action in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Given that some hallucinogens were reported to exert an anti-OCD effect outlasting their psychotomimetic action, possible modifications of neuronal responsiveness to 5-HT by LSD were examined in two rat brain structures: one associated with OCD, the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), and another linked to depression, the hippocampus. The effects of concurrent microiontophoretic application of LSD and 5-HT were examined on neuronal firing rate in the rat OFC and hippocampus under chloral hydrate anaesthesia. In order to determine whether LSD could also exert a modification of 5-HT neuronal responsiveness upon systemic administration, after a delay when hallucinosis is presumably no longer present, it was given once daily (100 mug/kg i.p.) for 4 d and the experiments were carried out 24 h after the last dose. LSD attenuated the firing activity of OFC neurons, and enhanced the inhibitory effect of 5-HT when concomitantly ejected on the same neurons. In the hippocampus, LSD also decreased firing rate by itself but decreased the inhibitory action of 5-HT. The inhibitory action of 5-HT was significantly greater in the OFC, but smaller in the hippocampus, when examined after subacute systemic administration of LSD. It is postulated that some hallucinogens could have a beneficial action in OCD by enhancing the responsiveness to 5-HT in the OFC, and not necessarily in direct relation to hallucinosis. The latter observation may have theoretical implications for the pharmacotherapy of OCD.

The well-documented fact that visual acuity and contrast. sensitivity in amblyopia are attenuated at high spatial frequencies predicts that amblyopes should perceive objects as blurred, because they do not have the high spatial frequency information necessary to represent sharp edges adequately. In the current study, the representation of blur in amblyopia with blur-discrimination and blur-matching tasks was explored in a series of experiments. METHODS. Monocular blur-discrimination thresholds were measured in a spatial two-alternative forced-choice procedure. Observers were required to discriminate which edge (right or left) appeared to be the lesser blurred. Observers also interocularly matched edges that were identical with those used in the blur-discrimination tasks, with the exception that they were viewed dichoptically at all times. RESULTS. Blur-discrimination thresholds were elevated in both the amblyopic and fellow fixing eyes but were within the normal range for interocular matching thresholds. CONCLUSIONS. The results suggest that blur is veridically represented in the amblyopic visual system. The surprising result is that all amblyopes, even those with the most severe visual loss, veridically matched all blurred edges, including the sharpest ones. This implies that amblyopes are able to represent levels of blur that are defined by spatial structure beyond their resolution limit.

The aim of this study was to assess this hypothesis in a prospective randomized trial. Methods: Two hundred sixty-eight consecutive patients underwent CABG at a single institution. All patients were randomized to either SAC (Group S) or POC (Group P) for the construction of the proximal anastomosis. Myocardial protection consisted of multidose antegrade cold blood cardioplegia with topical cooling. The operations were performed using standard cardiopulmonary bypass support and moderate systemic hypothermia (29 to 32degreesC). The incidences of neurological events, perioperative myocardial infarction (MI), and mortality were prospectively evaluated. Results: The two groups were similar in mean age, gender, urgency of operation, and number of bypasses. Group S patients had a significantly longer cross-clamp (61 +/- 21 minutes [S] vs 44 +/- 13.8 minutes [P], p < 0.05) and bypass times (85 +/- 25 minutes [S] vs 74 +/- 19.7 minutes [P], p < 0.05). There were no differences in the number of perioperative Mls (Group S = 3 [2.3%]; Group P = 2 [1.5%], p = 0.50) or mortality (Group S = 2 [1.5%]; Group P = 3 [2.2%], p = 0.50). Two patients randomized to POC were switched to SAC intraoperatively because of severe calcification of the ascending aorta. In Group P, there were two strokes (1.5%) and two (1.5%) postoperative confusions versus none in Group S (relative risk = 2.0, p < 0.05, respectively). Conclusion: The SAC technique improved cerebral protection without any adverse effect on myocardial protection and postoperative outcome in patients undergoing CABG.

This double-edged sympathetic response to emotional stress evolves during human lifespan and long-term evolution of hypertension. In the course of philogenesis it carries a potential mismatch between the normal physiology of the human dopaminergic system and current environmental (emotional particularly) conditions in industrialized countries. This offers a rational support to a mental stress-cardiovascular diseases relationship proposed 40 years ago in a WHO report which followed a memorable 1960 Prague Hypertension Meeting.

How these neurons maintain their activity to promote wakefulness is not known. Here, by recording for the first time from hypocretin-orexin neurons and comparing their properties with those of neurons expressing melanin-concentrating hormone, we show that hypocretin-orexin neurons are in an intrinsic state of membrane depolarization that promotes their spontaneous activity. We propose that wakefulness and associated energy expenditure thus depend on that property, which allows the hypocretin-orexin neurons to maintain a tonic excitatory influence on the central arousal and peripheral sympathetic systems.

During his career, Rasmussen probably performed more operations for epilepsy than any other surgeon of his time; he became the foremost authority in this field. His meticulous follow-up analyses of the MNI seizure series provided substantial evidence for the success of surgery in the treatment of focal epilepsy. In addition, he made significant contributions to surgery of the pituitary gland for control of cancer, treatment of cerebral and spinal tumors, application of the intracarotid Amytal test for lateralization of speech and memory function, and characterization and treatment of epilepsy accompanied by chronic encephalitis, now referred to as Rasmussen syndrome. His painstaking attention to surgical details as well as his insistence on close monitoring of patient care and critical scrutiny of clinical results marked him as an outstanding teacher and role model for young neurosurgeons and neuroscientists.

There is now all accumulation of psychophysical and neurophysiological evidence that the outputs of Cells With conjoint orientation preference and spatial position are integrated in the process of explication Of rudimentary contours. Recent neuroanatomical and neurophysiological results Suggest that this process takes place at the cortical level V1. The code for contour integration may be a temporal one in that it may only manifest itself in the latter part of the spike train as a result of feedback and lateral interactions. Here we review some of the properties Of contour integration from a psychophysical perspective and we speculate oil their underlying neurophysiological substrate. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

The aim of this study was to determine the early in vivo interactions between 3 systems known to contribute to vascular hypertrophic remodeling, in conduit and resistance arteries. Exogenous angiotensin II, norepinephrine and endothelin 1 administration elevated protein synthesis in the aorta and in small mesenteric arteries. In small arteries, the effect of angiotensin II was blocked by angiotensin II type 1, alpha-adrenergic and endothelin receptor antagonists, while only the alpha-adrenergic and endothelin receptor antagonists inhibited the effect of norepinephrine. Moreover, only the endothelin receptor antagonist significantly blunted the effect of exogenous endothelin on protein synthesis. In the aorta, the stimulation of angiotensin II on protein synthesis was also inhibited by the 3 antagonists. However, only the alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist blunted the response to norepinephrine, and the 3 antagonists prevented the endothelin-induced elevation of protein synthesis. The blood pressure effects of the drugs did not correlate with their capacity to stimulate or inhibit vascular protein synthesis. In conclusion, interactions in the control of protein synthesis are heterogeneous along the vascular tree. In small arteries, the interaction is linear with endothelin as the downstream effector. In the aorta, the local sympathetic nervous system appears to control protein synthesis. The heterogeneity in downstream effectors should be considered in studies investigating signaling events related to protein synthesis, which is used as an early marker of hypertrophy.

The sequence of regulatory elements, including a DR5 type retinoic acid response element (RARE) required for Hoxd4 neural enhancer activity, are highly conserved. Additionally, zebrafish and mouse neural enhancers function identically in transgenic mouse embryos. We tested whether sequence conservation reflects functional importance by altering the spacing and sequence of the RARE in the Hoxd4 neural. enhancer. Stabilizing receptor-DNA interactions did not anteriorize transgene expression. By contrast, conversion of the RARE from a DR5 to a DR2 type element decreased receptor-DNA stability and posteriorized expression. Hence, the setting of the Hox anterior expression border is not a simple function of the affinity of retinoid receptors for their cognate element. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

In the present study, the testes of PPCA-/-mice from 2 to 10 months of age were compared with those of their wild type counterparts. While germ and Sertoli cells appeared comparable in appearance and distribution, the mean profile area of seminiferous tubules showed a significant decrease between wild type and PPCA-/-mice, suggesting changes to the seminiferous tubules and their contents. In addition, macrophages in the interstitial space (IS) of PPCA-/-mice were large, spherical, and filled with pale lysosomes, unlike those seen in wild type mice, and a quantitative analysis of their frequency per unit area of IS in PPCA-/- mice revealed a significant increase compared to that of wild type mice; this was also the case for their mean profile area. Absence of mitotic figures, cycling cells, or degenerating figures in the IS suggests that the major recruitment of macrophages appears to be from the circulation. In the IS, Leydig cells also showed an accumulation of large pale lysosomes in PPCA-/-mice, and their frequency also increased significantly as compared to wild type mice. In the electron microscope, a close association of Leydig cell microvilli with the surface of macrophages was pronounced in PPCA-/-mice. Since macrophages and Leydig cells interact by secreting various factors between each other, and considering the fact that Leydig cells show an accumulation of large pale lysosomes in PPCA-/-mice, it is suggested that macrophages accumulate as a result of abnormalities occurring in Leydig cells. Taken together, the data on increase in frequency of macrophages suggests important functions for these cells in both wild type and PPCA-/-mice. (C) 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

But long-term interactions between axons and their myelin sheaths are poorly understood. Here we show that Cnp1, which encodes 2',3'-cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase in oligodendrocytes, is essential for axonal survival but not for myelin assembly. In the absence of glial cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase, mice developed axonal swellings and neurodegeneration throughout the brain, leading to hydrocephalus and premature death. But, in contrast to previously studied myelin mutants, the ultrastructure, periodicity and physical stability of myelin were not altered in these mice. Genetically, the chief function of glia in supporting axonal integrity can thus be completely uncoupled from its function in maintaining compact myelin. Oligodendrocyte dysfunction, such as that in multiple sclerosis lesions, may suffice to cause secondary axonal loss.

The present study was undertaken to assess COX-2 expression in hippocampal biopsies from patients with therapy-refractive temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). For this purpose, hippocampal CA1 subfield was dissected from epileptic patients with (n = 5) or without (n = 2) hippocampal sclerosis (HS). COX-2 expression was investigated using immunohistochemistry and semi-quantitative RT-PCR. COX-2 immunoreactivity in TLE patient material in the absence of HS was restricted to a few neurons of the hippocampus. In the presence of HS, on the other hand, a significant induction of astrocytic COX-2 immunoreactivity associated with a concomitant increase in the steady-state level of COX-2 mRNA was observed in the CA1 subfield. These findings suggest that induction of astrocytic COX-2 is implicated in the pathogenesis of HS in TLE and is consistent with the previous findings of increased concentrations of prostaglandins in the cerebrospinal fluid of these patients.

Here a 3D phase-encoded retinotopic mapping technique that does not require a reconstruction of the cortical surface is demonstrated. The visual field sign identification is completely automatic and the method directly supplies volumes for a region-of-interest analysis, facilitating the application of cortical mapping to a wider population. A validation of the method is provided by simulations and comparison to cortical surface-based methodology. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science (USA). All rights reserved.

All experiments were performed in mice using the 49degreesC tail-withdrawal assay. The benzodiazepine receptor agonist, diazepam, the serotonin synthesis inhibitor, para-chlorophenylalanine (p-CPA), and the 5-HT1A receptor agonist, 8-OH-DPAT, were all found to attenuate morphine and U50,488 analgesia. In each case, the attenuation was itself blocked by treatment with L-5-HTP, a serotonin precursor, bicuculline, a GABA(A) receptor antagonist or picrotoxin, a GABA(A)-gated chloride channel blocker. Neither L-5-HTP nor the GABAA receptor antagonists were found to affect morphine or U50,488 analgesia per se. Thus, these findings indicate that a benzodiazepine-GABAergic agent (diazepam) attenuates opioid analgesia through the serotonergic system, and anti serotonergic agents (8-OH-DPAT, p-CPA) attenuate opioid analgesia through the GABAergic system. The intimate interactions between GABA and serotonin in the present study further suggest that these neurotransmitters work in complex ways together rather than alone in the modulation of opioid analgesia.

Infrequently, sarcoidosis can manifest itself in the central nervous system, with granulomas involving the leptomeninges and presenting with facial nerve weakness. Sarcoid of the trigeminal nerve is exceedingly rare and can mimic trigeminal schwannoma. We review the literature on sarcoid granulomas of the trigeminal nerve and compare their radiological features with the more common schwannoma.. CLINICAL PRESENTATION: A 33-year-old woman presented with a history of left-sided facial pain and numbness for 11 months, which was presumed to be trigeminal neuralgia. A trial of carbamazepine had been unsuccessful in relieving the facial pain. Her neurological examination revealed decreased facial sensation in the V-1-V-2 distribution. Preoperative magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a contrast-enhancing mass centered in the left cavernous sinus with extension along the cisternal portion of the left trigeminal nerve. INTERVENTION: The patient underwent a left frontotemporal orbitozygomatic craniotomy with intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring of Cranial Nerves III, V, and VI and image guidance for subtotal microsurgical resection of what appeared, grossly and on frozen section, to be a neurofibroma. The final pathology report, however, revealed a sarcoid granuloma of the trigeminal nerve. CONCLUSION: The differential diagnosis of contrast-enhancing lesions in the lateral wall of the cavernous sinus should include inflammatory conditions such as sarcoidosis. We recommend that surgery for biopsy or decompression be used only for those patients in whom a diagnosis cannot be confirmed with noninvasive testing. If surgery is performed, intraoperative frozen pathology is very useful in guiding the extent of resection.

Here we review literature on the costs and benefits of torpor expression to examine the influence that energy may have on hibernation patterns. We first establish that the dichotomy between food- and fat-storing hibernators coincides with differences in diet rather than body size and show that small or large species pursuing either strategy have considerable potential scope in the amount of torpor needed to survive winter. Torpor expression provides substantial energy savings, which increase the chance of surviving a period of food shortage and emerging with residual energy for early spring reproduction. However, all hibernating mammals periodically arouse to normal body temperatures during hibernation. The function of these arousals has long been speculated to involve recovery from physiological costs accumulated during metabolic depression, and recent physiological studies indicate these costs may include oxidative stress, reduced immunocompetence, and perhaps neuronal tissue damage. Using an optimality approach, we suggest that trade-offs between the benefits of energy conservation and the physiological costs of metabolic depression can explain both why hibernators periodically arouse from torpor and why they should use available energy to minimize the depth and duration of their torpor bouts. On the basis of these trade-offs, we derive a series of testable predictions concerning the relationship between energy availability and torpor expression. We conclude by reviewing the empirical support for these predictions and suggesting new avenues for research on the role of energy availability in mammalian hibernation.

Participants were shown target sentences containing distractor words. They were instructed to read aloud each sentence and ignore distractors. The N400 event-related potential (ERP) was used to measure the extent of semantic processing of target and distracting information. It showed that younger adults semantically processed both target and distracting material, whereas online processing of target sentences in older adults was disrupted by the distractors. In older adults. memory for target information related to their susceptibility to distraction and inhibition efficiency. Implications for age-differences in inhibitory control, working memory, and resource capacity are discussed.

In 1995, the International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group developed standardized criteria for the diagnosis of restless legs syndrome. Since that time, additional scientific scrutiny and clinical experience have led to a better understanding of the condition. Modification of the criteria is now necessary to better reflect that increased body of knowledge, as well as to clarify slight confusion with the wording of the original criteria. Setting: The restless legs syndrome diagnostic criteria and epidemiology workshop at the National Institutes of Health. Participants: Members of the International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group and authorities on epidemiology and the design of questionnaires and scales. Objective: To modify the current criteria for the diagnosis of restless legs syndrome, to develop new criteria for the diagnosis of restless legs syndrome in the cognitively impaired elderly and in children, to create standardized criteria for the identification of augmentation, and to establish consistent questions for use in epidemiology studies. Results: The essential diagnostic criteria for restless legs syndrome were developed and approved by workshop participants and the executive committee of the International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group. Criteria were also developed and approved for the additional aforementioned groups. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Barbeau, H; Norman, KE				Barbeau, H; Norman, KE			The effect of noradrenergic drugs on the recovery of walking after spinal cord injury	SPINAL CORD			English	Review						spinal cord injuries; walking; reflexes; clonidine	MOTOR PATTERNS; LOCOMOTION; CLONIDINE; CAT; MODULATION; REFLEXES; STROKE	Clonidine, a noradrenergic agonist has been associated with improved walking in both spinal cat and spinal cord injured (SCI) subjects. Objectives: The objective of this brief review is to compare the effects of clonidine on walking capabilities in SCI subjects with functionally complete and incomplete spinal cord injuries. Study design/methods: Both oral administration and intrathecal injection of clonidine were investigated. A motorized treadmill was used and harness support provided in most of the SCI subjects as no walking capabilities could be observed overground. A single subject design was used in these chronic SCI subjects. Setting: Canada and France. Results: In complete SCI subjects while receiving clonidine, none of the subjects was able to initiate independent stepping. In contrast, the greatest effects were found in SCI subjects with injuries that are incomplete but still severely disabling while minimal effects could be observed in the more functional SCI subjects. These effects on walking are observed in measures of walking speed, and electromyographic and kinematic patterns. Regardless of effects on walking, however, a consistent decrease of the flexor reflex amplitude could be observed in all SCI subjects independent of the severity of the lesion. Conclusion: This review demonstrated that clonidine could be a powerful anti-spasmodic drug in addition to improving locomotion in a limited number of SCI subjects. The mechanism, significance and implications of these results will be discussed.

Isoprostanes are major peroxidation products. Since microvascular dysfunction seems to contribute to ischemic encephalopathies, we studied the cytotoxicity of 8-iso-prostaglandin F-2alpha (PGF(2alpha)) on cerebral microvascular cells. Methods-Microvascular endothelial, astroglial, and smooth muscle cells from newborn brain were cultured. The cytotoxicity of 8-iso-PGF(2alpha) on these cells was determined by MTT assays and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release, propidium iodide incorporation, and DNA fragmentation (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling [TUNEL]). In addition, effects of intraventricular injections of 8-iso-PGF(2alpha) and possible involvement of thromboxane in 8-iso-PGF(2alpha)-induced cytotoxicity were determined. Results-8-Iso-PGF(2alpha) induced time- and concentration-dependent endothelial cell death (EC50=0.1 nmol/L) but exerted little effect on smooth muscle and astroglial cells; endothelial cell death seemed mostly of oncotic nature (propidium iodide incorporation and LDH release). Cell death was associated with increased endothelial thromboxane A(2) (TXA(2)) formation and was prevented by TXA(2) synthase inhibitors (CGS12970 and U63557A); TXA(2) mimetics U46619 and I-BOP also caused endothelial cell death. Intraventricular injection of 8-iso-PGF(2alpha) induced periventricular damage, which was attenuated by CGS12970 pretreatment. Conclusions-These data disclose a novel action of 8-iso-PGF(2alpha) involving TXA(2) in oxidant stress-induced cerebral microvascular injury and brain damage.

J	Hess, RF; Ledgeway, T				Hess, RF; Ledgeway, T			The detection of direction-defined and speed-defined spatial contours: one mechanism or two?	VISION RESEARCH			English	Article						motion; direction; speed; paths; association field	INTRINSIC CONNECTIONS; STRIATE CORTEX; VISUAL-CORTEX; INTEGRATION; NEURONS; ORIENTATION; SELECTIVITY; NOISE	It is now accepted that the visual system integrates local orientation information across space to define spatial contours [Vision Research 33 (1993) 173]. More recently, it has been shown that similar integration occurs for the direction of local motion signals, in different parts of the visual field, if they are aligned along the axis of a spatial contour [Vision Research 42 (2002) 653]. Here we ask whether similar spatial-linking rules hold for contours comprised of local elements that share only a common speed (but not direction), in the presence of background elements which collectively have the same mean speed as the contour but considerable random variation in the speeds of the individual elements. Furthermore we investigate the detection of spatial contours that are defined by a common speed that is different (both locally and globally) from that of the background elements. The results show that there is a significant, albeit relatively weak, speed-association field with preferential linking between spatially proximal elements that have similar speeds. Although a salient speed difference between the contour and the background elements enhances detection performance for motion-defined contours, it does so primarily via a different route to that of direction linking. We suggest that for motion-defined contours the Gestalt notions of "common fate" and "good continuity", that describe the parsing of local velocity information into objects, boundaries and contours, are mediated via separate underlying perceptual mechanisms.

The stimuli consisted of luminance-modulated (first-order) and contrast-modulated (second-order) 1 cpd vertical sine-wave gratings drifting rightward for 140 ins at a velocity of 6 degrees/s. For each condition, we analysed the latencies and peak-to-baseline amplitudes of the P1and N2 peaks recorded at Oz. For first-order motion, both P1and N2 peaks were present at low (3%) contrast (i.e., depth modulations) whereas for second-order motion they appeared only at higher (25%) contrasts. When the two types of motion were equated for visibility, responses were slower for second-order motion than for first-order motion: about 44 ms slower for P1 latencies, 53 ms slower for N2 latencies, and 76 ms slower for reaction times. The longer VEP latencies for second-order motion support models that postulate additional processing steps for the extraction of second-order motion. The slower reaction time to the onset of second-order motion suggests that the longer neurophysiological analysis translates into slower detection. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

We show that there are independent global motion processing deficits in human amblyopia that are unrelated to the contrast sensitivity deficit, and that are more extensive for contrast-defined than for luminance-defined stimuli. We speculate that the site of these deficits must include the extra-striate cortex and in particular the dorsal pathway. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

We have investigated whether agrin, a key nerve-derived synaptogenic factor, influences rapsyn-AChR interactions and how this affects clustering and cytoskeletal linkage of AChRs. By precipitating AChRs and probing for associated rapsyn, we found that in denervated diaphragm rapsyn associates with synaptic as well as with extrasynaptic AChRs showing that rapsyn interacts with unclustered AChRs in vivo. Interestingly, synaptic AChRs are associated with more rapsyn suggesting that clustering of AChRs may require increased interaction with rapsyn. In similar experiments in cultured myotubes, rapsyn interacted with intracellular AChRs and with unclustered AChRs at the cell surface, although surface interactions are much more prominent. Remarkably, agrin induces recruitment of additional rapsyn to surface AChRs and clustering of AChRs independently of the secretory pathway. This agrin-induced increase in rapsyn-AChR interaction strongly correlates with clustering, because staurosporine and herbimycin blocked both the increase and clustering. Conversely, laminin and calcium induced both increased rapsyn-AChR interaction and AChR clustering. Finally, time course experiments revealed that the agrin-induced increase occurs with AChRs that become cytoskeletally linked, and that this precedes receptor clustering. Thus, we propose that neural agrin controls postsynaptic aggregation of the AChR by enhancing rapsyn interaction with surface AChRs and inducing cytoskeletal anchoring and that this is an important precursor step for AChR clustering.

Gain control of subthreshold depolarization is commonly ascribed to increased membrane conductance caused by shunting inhibition. But contrary to its divisive effect on depolarization, shunting inhibition on its own fails to divisively modulate firing rate, apparently upsetting a critical tenet of neural models that use shunting inhibition to achieve gain control. Using a biophysically realistic neuron model, we show that divisive modulation of firing rate by shunting inhibition requires synaptic noise to smooth the relation between firing rate and somatic depolarization; although necessary, noise alone endows shunting inhibition with only a modest divisive effect on firing rate. In addition to introducing noise, synaptic input is associated with a nonlinear relation between somatic depolarization and excitation because of dendritic saturation; this nonlinearity dramatically enhances divisive modulation of firing rate by shunting inhibition under noisy conditions. Thus, shunting inhibition can act as a mechanism for firing rate gain control, but its modulatory effects (which include both divisive and subtractive components) are fully explained only when both synaptic noise and dendritic saturation are taken into account.

In this study, we used the model of the neonatal rat to test the effects of repeated pain during the first 2 weeks of life on neuroendocrine responses (CRF. ACTH and corticosterone) to stressors varying in intensity and on maternal behavior in the postnatal period. To closely mimic the type of repeated painful stimulus experienced by preterm, neonates (i.e., heelstick), neonatal rats aged day 2-14 were submitted daily to having their rear heels warmed to 34 degreesC and pricked (handled and pain, HP) or not (handled, H) with a needle. For the procedure, all pups were separated from their mothers for a total period of 15 min and reunited afterwards. Unhandled (UH) pups not subjected to daily maternal separation were used as controls. On days 6 and 12, litters from the HP and H groups were videotaped for 90 min upon return with the mother and maternal behavior was analyzed. Frequency of ultrasonic vocalizations (USV) were recorded during the procedure and upon return of pups with the mother. On day 15 and 20, rat pups from all groups were exposed to a 3-min ether vapor stressor or to an openfield for 10 min. Plasma ACTH and corticosterone concentrations were determined at 0, 5, 30, 60 and 120 min after stress onset. Our results show that repeated pain did not modify body weight of the pups, however, on day 6 of life, maternal pup grooming was increased significantly (P<0.05) in the HP group compared to the H group. Frequency of USV was not changed between H and HP rats either during the separation or after reunion with the mother. Plasma ACTH and corticosterone levels under basal or stimulated conditions were not different between UH, H and HP groups. However, the UH pups showed a tendency towards higher ACTH secretion after stress compared to H and HP groups. These results suggest that repeated pain during the first 2 weeks of life in the rat does not lead to significant changes in stress responsiveness in 2-week-old pups, but we suggest that changes in mother-pup interaction (increased grooming) might act as a buffer on the cumulative effect of pain on stress responsiveness.

The purpose of this study is to test for association between these two polymorphisms and schizophrenia or its phenotypic variability with respect to neuroleptic therapeutic response and symptom profile. Allelic and haplotype distributions of these two polymorphisms were compared between two groups of schizophrenic patients (excellent neuroleptic-responders; R, n=42 and non-responders; NR, n=64), and one group of healthy volunteers (n=120). The "Del" and "a" alleles were in positive linkage disequilibrium. No allelic or genotype differences in the distribution of these two polymorphisms were observed between patients and controls. However, The Del-a haplotype was significantly more common in NR patients, and the mean total BPRS score was significantly higher in the group of patients with the Del-a compared to those without the Del-a haplotype. These results suggest that the DBH gene is not a causative factor in schizophrenia but that it may be a modulator of psychotic symptoms, severity of the disorder and therapeutic response to neuroleptic drugs.

Intracerebroventricular injection of 1 mug of the hormone in 1 mul of physiological solution 3 min before tetanization, produced a significant increase in both components of the perforant path-evoked potentials (EP) in the DG. The effects were already evident 1 min after tetanization. Amplitude of the EPs increased continuously for the 2 h of recording time, reaching values 100% above baseline, reference levels. In contrast, in previous in vitro studies [11], enhancement of LTP with AVP appeared only after 15 min of exposure of the hippocampal slice to the hormone, increased EPSPs were no higher than 50% from baseline, reached a plateau at 40 min decreasing slowly thereafter. Not only quantitative but also qualitative differences can be observed between in vitro and in vivo intact preparations in response to identical hormones. This study emphasizes the importance of hormone neurotransmitter interactions in determining electrophysiological characteristics of response to AVP. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

We show here that concurrent activation of P2X(2) ATP-gated channels and 5-HT3 serotonin-gated channels leads to functional interaction and nonadditive currents (47-73% of the predicted sum) in mammalian myenteric neurons as well as in Xenopus oocytes or transfected human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cell heterologous systems. We also show that these two cation channels coimmunoprecipitate constitutively and are associated in clusters. In heterologous systems, the inhibitory cross talk between P2X(2) and 5-HT3 receptors is disrupted when the intracellular C-terminal domain of the P2X(2) receptor subunit is deleted and when minigenes coding for P2X(2) or 5-HT(3)A receptor subunit cytoplasmic domains are overexpressed. Injection of fusion proteins containing the C-terminal domain of P2X(2) receptors in myenteric neurons also disrupts the functional interaction between native P2X(2) and 5-HT3 receptors. Therefore, activity-dependent intracellular coupling of distinct receptor channels underlies ionotropic cross talks that may significantly contribute to the regulation of neuronal excitability and synaptic plasticity.

Following intra-cellular recording from neurons in acute brain slices, the structure of the recorded cell has typically been examined by serial sectioning of the tissue slice and then reconstructing the neuron of interest; a labor-intensive and time-consuming process. Here, we have adapted a whole-mount inummohistochemical technique and used it to visualize the dendritic arbor of individual neurons in sections of adult CNS tissue up to 500 mum thick. Permeabilization of the slice and extensive washing allow histochemical reagents to penetrate and be washed from the section, producing limited background staining. Using this method, the cell within the slice can be sectioned optically and reconstructed using the optical sections. We present images of the dendritic trees of neurons in 500 mum thick slices of adult rat entorhinal cortex and hippocampus, labeled either immunohistochemically, or by biocytin injection following whole-cell patch clamp or sharp electrode recordings. The resolution obtained is sufficient to visualize dendritic spines deep within the section. The method is free from artifacts associated with cutting serial sections and is broadly applicable to tasks that require visualization of the fine structure of individual cells in thick slices of CNS tissue.

This task has been chosen because previous studies have shown that it provides distinct indices related to specific cognitive processes and to the functioning of specific brain regions. ERPs have been recorded in controls and schizophrenia patients separated into high scorers (RD+) and low-scorers (RD-) according to their Reality Distortion score (hallucination and delusion SAPS subscales). The results indicate that RD+ presents abnormalities on various cognitive processes. First, RD+ are deficient at interference inhibition and knowledge integration (reduced P2a and N400 effect). The similar impairments found in RD- suggest that they represent basic traits of the illness. Second, RD+ showed inappropriate stimulus categorization and contextual integration (larger N300 and fronto-central effect). Third, RD+ showed a late index (P600 effect) not different from controls, but larger than in RD-. This result is consistent with a qualitative, rather than quantitative, impairment of mnemonic binding processes (inappropriate binding) in RD+. Since each of the ERP abnormalities observed represents associated with distinct brain dysfunction, the results are further discussed in regard of the respective contribution of the parietal, frontal and hippocampal structures to reality distortion symptoms.

Equimolar substitution of extracellular Na+ by K+ or choline(+) sharply attenuated the effect of ouabain on intracellular Na+ and K+ content but did not protect the cells from death in the presence of ouabain. In contrast to ouabain, inhibition of the Na+/K+ pump in K+-free medium increased Na-i(+) content but did not affect cell survival. In control and K+-free medium, ouabain triggered half-maximal cell death at concentrations of similar to0.5 and 0.05 muM, respectively, which was consistent with elevation of Na+/K+ pump sensitivity to ouabain in K+-depleted medium. Our results show for the first time that the death of ouabain-treated renal epithelial cells is independent of the inhibition of Na+/K+ pump-mediated ion fluxes and the [Na+](i)]/[K+](i) ratio.

However, since a substantial portion of spinous NMDAR subunits can reside at sites removed from plasma membranes, whether or not these immunofluorescent clusters are synaptic remains to be shown. Also, the NR2A/B subunits undergo activity-dependent switching at synapses, indicating that their subcellular distribution may be regulated differently from the NRI subunits. We examined the issue of NMDAR autoregulation by determining whether in vivo NMDAR blockade enhances trafficking of the NR2A subunits toward spines and more specifically to postsynaptic densities (PSDs) of already mature synapses. Seven adult rats received unilateral intra-cortical infusion of the NMDAR antagonist, D-AP5 for 1/2-2 h and the inactive enantiomer or the solvent, alone, in the contralateral cortex. Using an electron microscope, similar to5600 cortical spines originating from the two hemispheres of the seven adult animals were analyzed for the location of NR2A subunits. In six out of the seven cases analyzed, the D-AP5-treated neuropil exhibited increased immunolabeling at PSDs and a concomitantly great increase at non-synaptic sites within spines. NR2A subunits also increased presynaptically within 1/2 It but not after I h. These findings indicate that NR2A subunits in intact, adult cortical neurons are prompted to become trafficked into spines and axon terminals by NMDAR inactivity, yielding an increase of a readily available reserve pool and greater localization at both sides of synapses.

Methods: Relevant literature was reviewed, abstracted, and classified. Recommendations were based on a four-tiered scheme of evidence classification. Results: Global developmental delay is common and affects 1% to 3% of children. Given yields of about 1%, routine metabolic screening is not indicated in the initial evaluation of a child with global developmental delay. Because of the higher yield (3.5% to 10%), even in the absence of dysmorphic features or features suggestive of a specific syndrome, routine cytogenetic studies and molecular testing for the fragile X mutation are recommended. The diagnosis of Rett syndrome should be considered in girls with unexplained moderate to severe developmental delay. Additional genetic studies (e.g., subtelomeric chromosomal rearrangements) may also be considered in selected children. Evaluation of serum lead levels should be restricted to those children with identifiable risk factors for excessive lead exposure. Thyroid studies need not be undertaken (unless clinically indicated) if the child underwent newborn screening. An EEG is not recommended as part of the initial evaluation unless there are historical features suggestive of epilepsy or a specific epileptic syndrome. Routine neuroimaging, with MRI preferred to CT, is recommended particularly if abnormalities are found on physical examination. Because of the increased incidence of visual and auditory impairments, children with global developmental delay may undergo appropriate visual and audiometric assessment at the time of diagnosis. Conclusions: A specific etiology can be determined in the majority of children with global developmental delay. Certain routine screening tests are indicated and depending on history and examination findings, additional specific testing may be performed.

Methods: FMTLE was defined when at least two first-degree relatives in a family had a clinical-EEG diagnosis of MTLE. Hippocampal formation measurements were performed using 1- to 3-mm coronal T1-weighted MRIs. The presence of hyperintense T2 signal was evaluated by visual analysis. For statistical analyses, analysis of variance, X 2 test, and regression analysis were used. Results: A total of 142 patients from 45 unrelated families were studied: 113 individuals with MTLE (80 with good seizure control) and 29 family members with other seizure types. There were 99 patients (69.7%) with hippocampal atrophy (HA). Sixty-seven of the 99 patients with HA also had a hyperintense T2 signal. Hyperintense T2 signal was associated with more severe HA (p = 0.04). Patients with refractory FMTLE had more frequent HA (p = 0.03) and hyperintense T2 signal (p 0.004) and more severe atrophy (p < 0.0001). Duration of epilepsy correlated with HcV asymmetry index (r(2) = 0.12, p = 0.00008) and with the more atrophic hippocampi but not with contralateral hippocampi. Conclusion: In familial mesial temporal lobe epilepsy, seizure severity is variable in affected individuals. Hippocampal atrophy was present in 70% of these patients and 69% of these had an associated hyperintense T2 signal. Although hippocampal atrophy associated with abnormal T2 signal was more frequent and more severe in patients with poor seizure control, it was also frequent in affected individuals across families. These observations suggest that one or more genes resulting in familial mesial temporal lobe epilepsy predisposes both to the clinical features of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy and to the development of hippocampal sclerosis.

Electrophysiological recordings of the primary afferents in humans suggest that SAII fibers represent approximately 15% of the myelinated mechanosensitive axons in the peripheral nerves innervating the volar surface of the hand. In the present study, an analysis of glabrous skin was conducted in human donors to assess the distribution of Ruffini and Ruffini-like corpuscles in the distal phalanx of the index finger. Only one presumptive Ruffini corpuscle was found in the skin processed for double immunofluorescence labeling with antibodies against protein gene product 9.5 and neurofilament 200-kDa subunit. Based on their relatively scattered distributions, we conclude that very few SAII primary afferents are likely to terminate as Ruffini corpuscles in human glabrous skin. (C) 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

We have developed an approach, antibody-positioned RNA amplification (APRA), to identify the RNA cargoes associated with the in vivo configured FMRP messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) complex. Using APRA as a primary screen, putative FMRP RNA cargoes were assayed for their ability to bind directly to FMRP using traditional methods of assessing RNA-protein interactions, including UV-crosslinking and filter binding assays. Approximately 60% of the APRA-defined mRNAs directly associate with FMRP. By examining a subset of these mRNAs and their encoded proteins in brain tissue from Fmr1 knockout mice, we have observed that some of these cargoes as well as the proteins they encode show discrete changes in abundance and/or differential subcellular distribution. These data are consistent with spatially selective regulation of multiple biological pathways by FMRP.

The recently characterized pyrolysin-like subtilase SKI-1 cleaves proproteins at nonbasic residues. In this work we describe the properties of a proteinase K-like subtilase, neural apoptosis-regulated convertase 1 (NARC-1), representing the ninth member of the secretory subtilase family. Biosynthetic and micro-sequencing analyses of WT and mutant enzyme revealed that human and mouse pro-NARC-1 are autocatalytically and intramolecularly processed into NARC-1 at the (Y,I)VV(V,L)(L,M) down arrow motif, a site that is representative of its enzymic specificity. In vitro peptide processing studies and/or Ala substitutions of the P1-P5 sites suggested that hydrophobic/aliphatic residues are more critical at P1, P3, and P5 than at P2 or P4. NARC-1 expression is highest in neuroepithelioma SK-N-MCIXC, hepatic BRL-3A, and in colon carcinoma LoVo-C5 cell lines. in situ hybridization and Northern blot analyses of NARC-1 expression during development in the adult and after partial hepatectomy revealed that it is expressed in cells that have the capacity to proliferate and differentiate. These include hepatocytes, kidney mesenchymal cells, intestinal ileum, and colon epithelia as well as embryonic brain telencephalon neurons. Accordingly, transfection of NARC-1 in primary cultures of embryonic day 13.5 telencephalon cells led to enhanced recruitment of undifferentiated neural progenitor cells into the neuronal lineage, suggesting that NARC-1 is implicated in the differentiation of cortical neurons.

We present a clinical report of three patients diagnosed for type II sialidosis. The first patient is a 12-year-old boy with the classic infantile form. His sister had a congenital form of sialidosis and died at 20 months of age. The third, non-related patient presented shortly after 1 year of age and had borderline cognitive delay at 9 years. All three patients were homozygous for the C808T mutation of the NEU gene. Their ancestors originated from a small area to the east of the city of Seville (Spain), suggesting the existence of a Seville founder mutation. (C) 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

With hypoxia, exercise Pa-O2 dropped to 31-34 mmHg and arterial O-2 content (Ca-O2) was reduced by 35% (P < 0.001). Forty-one percent of the reduction in Ca-O2 was explained by the lower inspired O-2 pressure (PIO2) in hypoxia, whereas the rest was due to the impairment of the pulmonary gas exchange, as reflected by the higher alveolar-arterial O-2 difference in hypoxia (P < 0.05). Hypoxia caused a 47% decrease in (V) over dot O-2max (a greater fall than accountable by reduced Ca-O2). Peak cardiac output decreased by 17% (P < 0.01), due to equal reductions in both peak heart rate and stroke volume (P < 0.05). Peak leg blood flow was also lower (by 22%, P < 0.01). Consequently, systemic and leg O-2 delivery were reduced by 43 and 47%, respectively, with hypoxia (P < 0.001) correlating closely with (V) over dotO(2max) (r = 0.98, P < 0.001). Therefore, three main mechanisms account for the reduction of (V) over dotO(2max) in severe acute hypoxia: 1) reduction of PIO2, 2) impairment of pulmonary gas exchange, and 3) reduction of maximal cardiac output and peak leg blood flow, each explaining about one-third of the loss in (V) over dot O-2max.

The output of adrenal catecholamine and PACAP-38-like immunoreactivity (PACAP-38-ir) increased in a frequency-dependent manner after direct splanchnic nerve stimulation (0.2-20 Hz). Both responses were highly reproducible, and PACAP-38-ir output closely correlated with catecholamine output. Sodium nitroprusside (SNP; 0.1 mg/kg iv bolus) caused a severe hypotension resulting in marked increases in catecholamine secretion. In the presence of local PACAP-27 (125 ng), the maximum catecholamine response to SNP was significantly potentiated in a synergistic manner compared with that obtained in the group receiving SNP or PACAP-27 alone. The study indicates that endogenous PACAP-38 can be released particularly when the sympathoadrenal system is highly activated and that the local exogenous PACAP-27 enhanced the reflex-induced catecholamine release, suggesting collectively a facilitating role of PACAP as neuromodulator in the sympathoadrenal function in vivo.

Phonomyography is an alternative method of neuromuscular monitoring. in this study, phonomyography is applied to determine blockade at the larynx and compared with the cuff pressure method. Methods: After the authors obtained approval from the ethics committee and informed consent, 28 patients were entered in the study. After induction of anesthesia, a endotracheal tube was inserted. Its cuff was placed in the trachea in routine fashion (n = 14) or between the vocal cords (n = 14). In all patients, a small condenser microphone was placed in the vestibular fold, just lateral to the tube, next to the laryngeal adductor muscles. The recurrent laryngeal nerve was stimulated supramaximally with single twitch stimulation (0.1 Hz) for onset, and train-of-four stimulation every 12 s during offset of neuromuscular blockade was produced by 0.1 mg/kg mivacurium. Onset and recovery of neuromuscular blockade measured by the two methods were compared using the t test (P < 0.05), and a Bland-Altman test was performed to define agreement between the two methods. Onset and recovery of neuromuscular blockade measured by phonomyography with the cuff placed between the vocal cords or in the trachea were compared using the t test (P < 0.05). Results. Mean onset, maximum effect, and time to reach 25% and 75% of control twitch response for phonomyography versus cuff pressure method were 145 s (SD, 25) versus 156 s (SD, 33),89% (SD, 4) versus 91% (SD, 4), 9 min (SD, 4) versus 10 min (SD, 3), and 27 min (SD, 4) versus 29 min (SD, 4), respectively, without being significantly different. Mean bias was -2%, with limits of agreement of -20 and +18% for all signals (cuff method minus; phonomyography). There was no significant difference in onset and offset of neuromuscular blockade measured using phonomyography with the cuff placed between the vocal cords or in the trachea. Conclusions: Both methods can be used interchangeably to determine neuromuscular blockade of the laryngeal adductor muscles. Phonomyography allows measurement of laryngeal blockade with the endotracheal tube in the normal position.

Whereas Liepmann suggested that the left hemisphere is motor dominant, others maintain that both hemispheres have equal motor competences and propose that left hand apraxia in patients with callosal disconnection is secondary to left hemispheric specialization for language or other task modalities. The present study aims to gain further insight into the motor competence of the right hemisphere by investigating pantomime of object use in split-brain patients. Three patients with complete callosotomy and, as control groups, five patients with partial callosotomy and nine healthy subjects were examined for their ability to pantomime object use to visual object presentation and demonstrate object manipulation. In each condition, 11 objects were presented to the subjects who pantomimed or demonstrated the object use with either hand. In addition, six object pairs were presented to test bimanual coordination. Two independent raters evaluated the videotaped movement demonstrations. While object use demonstrations were perfect in all three groups, the split-brain patients displayed apraxic errors only with their left hands in the pantomime condition. The movement analysis of concept and execution errors included the examination of ipsilateral versus contralateral motor control. As the right hand/left hemisphere performances demonstrated retrieval of the correct movement concepts, concept errors by the left hand were taken as evidence for right hemisphere control. Several types of execution errors reflected a lack of distal motor control indicating the use of ipsilateral pathways. While one split-brain patient controlled his left hand predominantly by ipsilateral pathways in the pantomime condition, the error profile in the other two split-brain patients suggested that the right hemisphere controlled their left hands. In the object use condition, in all three split-brain patients fine-graded distal movements in the left hand indicated right hemispheric control. Our data show left hand apraxia in split-brain patients is not limited to verbal commands, but also occurs in pantomime to visual presentation of objects. As the demonstration with object in hand was unimpaired in either hand, both hemispheres must contain movement concepts for object use. However, the disconnected right hemisphere is impaired in retrieving the movement concept in response to visual object presentation, presumably because of a deficit in associating perceptual object representation with the movement concepts.

Using high resolution MRI, we previously showed that the volume of the entorhinal cortex was decreased in patients with TLE. The purpose of this study was: (i) to determine whether changes in the volume of the perirhinal cortex and posterior parahippocampal cortex were detectable by MRI; and (ii) to study the distribution and degree of atrophy in mesial temporal structures including the hippocampal head, body and tail, amygdala, entorhinal cortex, perirhinal cortex and posterior parahippocampal cortex. MRI volumetric analysis was performed using a T-1-weighted three-dimensional gradient echo sequence in 20 healthy subjects and 25 TLE patients with intractable TLE. In patients with either left or right TLE, the hippocampal head, body and tail and the entorhinal and perirhinal cortices ipsilateral to the seizure focus were significantly smaller than in normal controls. The mean volume of the posterior parahippocampal cortex was not different from that of normal controls. Within the hippocampus, the hippocampal head was more atrophic than the hippocampal body and hippocampal tail. Within the parahippocampal region, the entorhinal cortex was more severely affected than the perirhinal cortex. Our MRI results confirm pathological findings of damage in the mesial temporal lobe, involving not only the hippocampus and the amygdala, but also the entorhinal and perirhinal cortices. The pattern of atrophy may be explained by cell loss secondary to a disruption of entorhinal-hippocampal connections as a result of privileged electrical dialogue between these two structures.

ANP activates guanylyl cyclase that converts guanosine triphosphate into cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). cGMP activates protein kinase G that reduces heart rate and force of contraction, decreasing cardiac output. ANP acts similarly to induce vasodilation. The intrinsic OT system in the heart and vascular system augments the effects of circulating OT to cause a rapid reduction in effective circulating blood volume. Furthermore, natriuresis is rapidly induced by the action of ANP on its tubular guanylyl cyclase receptors, resulting in the production of cGMP that closes Na+ channels. The OT released by volume expansion also acts on its tubular receptors to activate nitric oxide synthase. The nitric oxide released activates guanylyl cyclase leading to the production of cGMP that also closes Ne channels, thereby augmenting the natriuretic effect of ANP. The natriuresis induced by cGMP finally causes blood volume to return to normal. At the same time, the ANP released acts centrally to decrease water and salt intake.

Quantitative in vitro autoradiography was also performed in the midbrain of SHR and Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) with the NK3 receptor ligand [I-125]-HPP-Senktide. 2 Tachycardia was elicited by the NK1 ([Sar(9),Met(O-2)(11)]SP) and NK2 ([betaAla(8)]NKA(4-10)) agonists at 25 and 100 pmol while the NK3 agonist (senktide, 50 and 100 pmol) had no significant effect. The three agonists had no effect on behaviour, and increases in MAP were elicited by the NK1 agonist only. 3 Whereas antagonists at NK1 (RP 67580, 500 pmol) and NK2 (SR 48968, 500 pmol) receptors had no significant effect on MAP and HR, the NK3 antagonist (R-820, 500 pmol) reduced MAP for over 3 h in SHR. That anti-hypertensive effect did not occur after intracerebroventricular or intravenous injection of R-820. Also, R-820 had no cardiovascular effect in WKY. 4 The affinity (K-D: 0.7 nm) and densities of specific NK3 receptor binding sites measured in the substantia nigra, ventral tegmental area, hippocampus and amygdala were not significantly different in SHR and WKY. 5 It is concluded that endogenous tachykinins exert a tonic activity on NK3 receptors in the substantia nigra of SHR to maintain high blood pressure. Hence, nigral tachykinin NK3 receptors may represent a promising therapeutic target in the treatment of arterial hypertension.

It is used in cardiac anesthesia to prevent hypertension and arrhythmias. This study was performed to measure the interaction between magnesium and cisatracurium in cardiac surgery. Methods: Twenty patients scheduled for elective cardiac surgery were randomly assigned to receive magnesium sulfate (70 mg.kg(-1) at induction followed by 30 mg.kg(-1)-hr(-1)) or placebo. The uInar nerve was stimulated and the electromyographic response of the adductor pollicis was measured. Cisatracurium 0.1 mg.kg(-1) was given at induction, followed by 0.05 mg-kg(-1) when the first twitch in the train-of-four reached 25%. Results: Ionized magnesium was 1.32 +/- 0.24 mmol.L-1 in the treatment group vs 0.47 +/- 0.4 mmol.L-1 in the control group. Duration of action of the intubating dose was longer in the magnesium group (74 +/- 20 min) than in the placebo group (42 +/- 6 min, P = 0.0001). Duration of the first maintenance dose was 69 +/- 16 min in the magnesium group vs 35 7 min in the placebo group (P = 0.0001). Total dose of cisatracurium administered throughout surgery was 0.19 +/- 0.07 mg.kg(-1) in the magnesium group compared with 0.29 +/- 0.01 mg.kg(-1) in the placebo group (P = 0.017). Hemodynamic variables and temperature were similar in both groups. Conclusion: In patients undergoing cardiac surgery, administration of magnesium sulfate, resulting in ionized levels of 1.3 mmol.L-1, results in a 30-35 min prolongation of the neuromuscular blockade induced with intubating and maintenance doses of cisatracurium and does not alter hemodynamic stability.

Methods: A recent Canadian lawsuit is described and the literature regarding perioperative ulnar and other focal neuropathies reviewed. Results: The evidence strongly suggests that ulnar nerve damage is usually sustained in the postoperative rather than the intraoperative period. There is no evidence that positioning or padding of the arm during the operation prevents perioperative ulnar neuropathies. Conclusions: There should generally be no basis for a claim against medical or nursing staff or hospitals when an ulnar neuropathy develops following anesthesia and surgery.

The mechanism of action of these lipid messengers is thought to be primarily dependent on their interaction with specific cell surface receptors that belong to the heptahelical transmembrane spanning G protein-coupled receptor superfamily. Accumulating evidence suggests that these receptors may co-localize at the cell nucleus where they can modulate gene expression through a series of biochemical events. In this context, we have recently demonstrated that prostaglandin E-2-EP3 receptors display an atypical nuclear compartmentalization in cerebral microvascular endothelial cells. Stimulation of these nuclear EP3 receptors leads to an increase of eNOS RNA in a cell-free isolated nuclear system. This review will emphasize these findings and describe how nuclear prostaglandin receptors, notably EP3 receptors, may affect gene expression, specifically of eNOS, by identifying putative transducing elements located within this organelle. The potential sources of lipid ligand activators for these intracellular sites will also be addressed. The expressional control of G-protein-coupled receptors located at the perinuclear envelope constitutes a novel and distinctive mode of gene regulation.

Method: The author examined the literature from the last 2 decades and data from studies in which he was involved. Results: Schizophrenia sufferers show an elevated liability for substance abused Such comorbidity may derive from self-medication attempts, a common neuropathology for addiction and schizophrenia, the psychotogenic properties of certain drugs, or the influence of environmental factors. Among schizophrenia patients receiving treatment, substance misuse is associated with more severe symptoms and poorer therapeutic response. The presence of a chronic psychosis impedes treatment of the substance problem in traditional, nonpsychiatric addiction programs. Better outcomes are observed in integrated therapy services, where patients receive appropriate care for both conditions. Conclusion: Dual-pathology patients need comprehensive care with appropriate pharmacotherapy and psychosocial interventions. This treatment can be best provided within the context of a continuing care psychiatric service.

It seems to be a translation of Pavlovian conditioning into neural terms. The version that appears in I is book, The Organization of Behavior (1949), speaks of synapses rather than routes, but the idea of simultaneous firing of afferent and efferent elements is common to both versions. The postulate was adopted by groups interested in programming computers to learn and think. It was also one of the hypotheses tested by neurophysiologists in their search for the synaptic mechanism of learning. So far the neurophysiologists have had more success than the logicians;. the NMDA synapse appears to explain the main features of Hebb's postulate.

The usefulness of this technology hinges on the accuracy of the transformation between the image volume and the space occupied by the patient anatomy and spanned by the probe. Unfortunately, in neurosurgery this transformation can be degraded by intra-surgical brain shift, which often measures more than 10 mm and can exceed 25 mm. We propose a method for characterizing brain shift that is based on non-rigid surface registration, and can be combined with a constitutively realistic finite element approach for volumetric displacement estimation. The proposed registration method integrates in a unified framework all of the stages required to estimate the movement of the cortical surface in the operating room: model-based segmentation of the pre-operative brain surface in magnetic resonance image data, range-sensing of the cortex in the OR, range-MR rigid transformation computation, and range-based non-rigid brain motion estimation. The brain segmentation technique is an adaptation of the surface evolution model. Its convergence to the brain boundary is the result of a speed term restricted to white and grey matter voxels made explicit by a classifier, and the final result is post-processed to yield a Closest Point Map of the brain surface in MR space. In turn, this Closest Point Map is used to produce the homologous pairs required to determine a highly efficient, 2D spline-based, Iterative Closest Point (ICP) non-rigid surface registration. The baseline for computing intra-operative brain displacement, as well as the initial starting point of the nonrigid ICP registration, is determined by a very good rigid range-MR transformation, produced by a simple procedure for relating the range coordinate system to that of the probe, and ultimately to that of the MR volume.

Genetic evidence suggests that each protein is essential for embryonic development, but their exact functions are not fully elucidated. Moreover, because all three proteins share similar transcriptional properties in vitro, and because transcripts for two or more GATA genes are present in similar tissues, the molecular basis underlying in vivo specificity of GATA factors remains undefined. Knowledge of the exact cell types expressing each protein and identification of downstream targets would greatly help define their function. We have used high-resolution immunohistochemistry to precisely determine the cellular distribution of the GATA-4, -5, and -6 proteins in murine embryogenesis. The results reveal novel sites of expression in mesodermal and ectodermal cells. In particular, GATA-4 and -6 expression was closely associated with yolk sac vasculogenesis and early endoderm-mesoderm signaling. Additionally, GATA-6 was strongly expressed in the embryonic ectoderm, neural tube, and neural crest-derived cells. This pattern of expression closely paralled that of BMP-4, and the BMP-4 gene was identified as a direct downstream target for GATA-4 and -6. These findings offer new insight into the function of GATA-4 and -6 during early stages of embryogenesis and reveal the existence of a positive cross-regulatory loop between BMP-4 and GATA-4. They also raise the possibility that part of the early defects in GATA-4 and/or GATA-6 null embryos may be due to impaired BMP-4 signaling. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science (USA). All rights reserved.

Diabetic neuropathy is accompanied by a range of positive (paresthaesia, dysesthaesia, pain) and negative (hypesthaesia, anesthaesia) neurological symptoms suggesting widespread alterations in axonal excitability. The nature and the mechanisms underlying these alterations in axonal excitability are not well understood. The aim of this study was to examine the extent of changes in membrane properties of an identified neuronal structure-the large myelinated sensory axons in early experimental diabetes in rats. Methods. Intra-axonal microelectrode recordings from large sensory myelinated axons from the isolated sural nerve in short-term streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats were used to study membrane properties using standard current-clamp technique. Results. In addition to decreased conduction velocity we found several differences in physiological properties of sensory axons from diabetic rats: decreased resting membrane potential, decreased single action potential amplitude associated with slower rate of rise and decrease in inward rectification associated with slight alteration in outwardly rectifying conductances indicating impaired potassium conductances. Conclusion/Interpretation. These results extend previous indirect evidence that potassium and sodium ionic conductances, most notably the inward rectifier (IR, I-h), are altered in large sensory axons of diabetic rats.

However, the functional consequences of these mutations remain largely unknown. We identified a mutation (D188V) in SCN1A segregating with generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures (GEFS) in a large kindred. Compared to wild-type sodium channels, in vitro expression of channels harboring the D188V mutation were found to be more resistant to the decline in amplitude that is normally observed over the course of high frequency pulse trains. This small change on a single aspect of channel function is compatible with an increase in membrane excitability, such as during sustained and uncontrolled neuronal discharges. These data suggest that this specific effect on sodium channel function could be a general mechanism in the pathophysiology of epilepsies caused by mutations in sodium channels in humans.

In a previous study, such temporal co-ordination was not found in patients with left-hemispheric brain lesions reaching with either their dominant paretic or with their non-dominant non-paretic arm. This co-ordination deficit may be associated in part with the presence of a lesion in the dominant left hemisphere. If so, then no deficit should be observed in patients with stroke-related damage in their non-dominant right hemisphere moving with their ipsilesional arm. To verify this, 21 right-hand dominant adults (7 who had had a stroke in the right hemisphere, 7 who had had a stroke in the left hemisphere and 7 healthy subjects) pointed to two targets located on a table in front of them in the ipsilateral and contralateral workspace. Pointing was done under three movement conditions: while not moving the trunk, while bending the trunk forward and while bending the trunk backwards. The experiment was repeated with the non-paretic arm of patients with stroke and for the right and left arms of healthy subjects. Kinematic data were recorded (Optotrak). Results showed that, compared to healthy subjects, arm-trunk timing was disrupted in patients with stroke for some conditions. As in patients with lesions in the dominant hemisphere, arm-trunk timing in those with lesions in the non-dominant hemisphere was equally more variable than movements in healthy subjects. However, patients with dominant hemisphere lesions used significantly less trunk displacement than those with nondominant hemisphere lesions to accomplish the task. The deficit in trunk displacement was not due to problems of trunk control or sitting balance since, in control experiments, all subjects were able to move the trunk the required distance, with and without the added weight of the limb. Results support the hypothesis that the temporal co-ordination of trunk and arm recruitment during pointing movements is mediated bilaterally by each hemisphere. However, the difference in the range of trunk displacement between patients with left and right brain lesions suggests that the left (dominant) hemisphere plays a greater role than the right in the control of movements involving complex co-ordination between the arm and trunk.

In an attempt to determine the consequences of an overexpression of PDGF-B during the first weeks of life, we targeted transgenic expression of a human PDGF-B cDNA to myelinating tracts using the promoter region of the myelin basic protein (MBP) gene. Transgenic mRNA and protein were expressed in the brain and the expression profile of the human PDGF-B during early postnatal development closely paralleled that of the endogenous mouse MBP gene. The gross morphological appearance of transgenic brains was normal but at the cellular level several phenotypic alterations could be identified. In white matter tracts such as the corpus callosum and cerebellar medulla, there was a marked hypercellularity. The number of oligodendrocyte precursors was increased and astrocytes were more abundant. In adult mice carrying the MBP-PDGF-B transgene, however, myelination appeared normal and the amount of oligodendrocytes was similar to that of control littermates. In addition to the phenotypic alterations in the brain, investigation of eye structure revealed a striking disorganization of retinal architecture. The retina was folded with cells collected in papillar or follicular-like structures. Retinal whole mount preparations after India ink perfusion revealed capillary disorganization with large-caliber vessels supporting only a few fine branches. Our observations strengthen the notion that PDGF is an important effector molecule in postnatal CNS development.

However, the dynamics of changes in glucose metabolism remain unclear. The present study was undertaken using H-1 and C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to determine the rates of incorporation of glucose into amino acids and lactate via cell-specific pathways in relation to the severity of encephalopathy and brain edema in rats with ALF because of hepatic devascularization. Early (precoma) stages of encephalopathy were accompanied by significant 2- to 4.5-fold (P < .001) increases of total brain glutamine and lactate concentrations. More severe (coma) stages of encephalopathy and brain edema led to a further significant increase in brain lactate but no such increase in glutamine. Furthermore, C-13 isotopomer analysis showed a selective increase of de novo synthesis of lactate from [1-C-13]glucose resulting in 2.5-fold increased fractional C-13 enrichments in lactate at coma stages. [2-C-13]glutamine, synthesized through the astrocytic enzyme pyruvate carboxylase, increased 10-fold at precoma stages but showed no further increase at coma stages of encephalopathy. C-13-label incorporation into [4-C-13]glutamate, synthesized mainly through neuronal pyruvate dehydrogenase, was selectively reduced at coma stages, whereas brain GABA synthesis was unchanged at all time points. In conclusion, increased brain lactate synthesis and impaired glucose oxidative pathways rather than intracellular glutamine accumulation are the major cause of brain edema in ALF. Future NMR spectroscopic studies using stable isotopes and real-time measurements of metabolic rates could be valuable in the elucidation of the cerebral metabolic consequences of ALF in humans.

Compared to matched controls, our results demonstrate that the motion sensitivity of observers with autism is similar to that of nonautistic observers for different types of first-order (luminance-defined) motion stimuli, but significantly decreased for the same types of second-order (texture-defined) stimuli. The latter class of motion stimuli has been demonstrated to require additional neural computation to be processed adequately. This finding may reflect less efficient integrative functioning of the neural mechanisms that mediate visuoperceptual processing in autism. The contribution of this finding with regards to abnormal perceptual integration in autism, its effect on cognitive operations, and possible behavioral implications are discussed.

Previous experiments showed that these two cues are affected differently by intense prior stimulation; the difference in response strength declines and may even reverse in sign, but the difference in latency is unaffected. Here, I use an intense, constant tone to disrupt localization cues generated by a subsequent train of sound pulses. Recordings from the auditory nerve confirm that tone stimulation reduces, and sometimes reverses, the interaural difference in response strength to subsequent sound pulses, but that it enhances the interaural latency difference. If sound location is determined mainly from latency comparison, then behavioral responses to a pulse train following tone stimulation should be normal, but if the main cue for sound location is interaural difference in response strength, then, post-tone behavioral responses should sometimes be misdirected. Initial phonotactic responses to the post-tone pulse train were frequently directed away from, rather than towards, the sound source, indicating that the dominant sensory cue for sound location is interaural difference in response strength.

We utilized human brain-derived endothelial cells (HBECs) coated membranes in Boyden chambers to assess immune function related properties of human blood-derived monocytes following interaction with HBECs. Monocytes in contact with HBECs maintained functional antigen-presenting capacity and chemokine/cytokine production in contrast to monocytes that migrated through the HBEC barrier. These results indicate that HBECs, although themselves incapable of serving as competent antigen-presenting cells during the course of inflammatory CNS disorders, supply support needed for infiltrating perivascular monocytes to maintain their functions.

Beta-interferon (BIFN) substantially reduces new inflammatory activity in MS and a recent report suggested that it may reverse a component of axonal injury. To test the generalisability of this conclusion, particularly in a population with relatively active disease, we used magnetic resonance spectroscopy measures to test whether BIFN can reverse or arrest progression of axonal injury in patients with MS. Eleven patients with a history of active (median, 1.5 relapses/year) relapsing remitting MS were treated with BIFN and responses to treatment were monitored with serial MRI and single voxel magnetic resonance spectroscopic measurements of relative concentrations of brain N-acetylaspartate (NAA), a measure of axonal integrity from a central, predominantly white matter brain region. BIFN treatment was associated with a significant reduction in relapse rate (p = 0.007) and white matter water T2 relaxation time (p = 0.047) over 12 months. Also consistent with a treatment effect, white matter T2-hyperintense lesion loads did not increase. However, the central white matter NAA/creatine ratio (NAA/Cr, which was reduced over 16 % in patients relative to healthy controls at the start of treatment), continued to decrease in the patients over the period of observation (mean 6.2 % decrease, p = 0.02). For individual patients the magnitude of the NAA/Cr decrease was correlated with the frequency of relapses over the two years prior to treatment (r = -0.76, p = 0.006). These data suggest that reduction of new inflammatory activity with BIFN does not invariably halt progression of axonal injury. Nonetheless, there appears to be a relationship between the rate of progression of axonal injury and relapse rate over the previous two years. The consequences of reduced inflammation on pathological progression relevant to disability therefore may be present, but substantially delayed. Alternatively, distinct mechanisms may contribute to the two processes.

Action potentials were eliminated in tetrodotoxin, repolarized by tetraethylammonium (TEA) and 3,4-diaminopyridine (3,4-AP)-sensitive potassium conductances, and had a cobalt-sensitive, high-threshold calcium component. Depolarizing current injection evoked a brief (approximately 10-30 ms) burst of action potentials that was terminated by strong, outwardly rectifying voltage-activated potassium and calcium-dependent conductances. In the presence of intracellular cesium ions, a prolonged plateau potential often followed brief depolarizations. During larval development (hatching to free-swimming), the resting membrane conductance increased in a population of motoneurons, which tended to reduce the apparent outward rectification of the membrane. The conductances contributing to action potential burst termination are hypothesized to play a role in patterning the synaptically driven motoneuron output in these rapidly swimming fish.

During presentation of the instructional cue, the majority (55/90, 61%) of cells in PMd were tuned with both arms, and their dynamic range showed a trend for stronger discharge with the contralateral arm. Most strikingly, however, the preferred direction of most of these latter cells (41/55, 75%) was not significantly different between arms. During movement, many PMd cells continued to be tuned with both arms (53/90, 59%), with a trend for increasing directional differences between the arms over the course of the trial. In contrast, during presentation of the instructional cue only 5/74 (7%) cells in M1 were tuned with both arms. During movement, about half of M1 cells (41/74, 55%) were tuned with both arms but the preferred directions of their tuning functions were often very different and there was a strong bias toward greater discharge rates when the contralateral arm was used. Similar trends were observed for EMG activity. In conclusion, M1 is strongly activated during movements of the contralateral arm, but activity during ipsilateral arm movements is also common and usually different from that seen with the contralateral arm. In contrast, a major component of task-related activity in PMd represents movement in a more abstract or task-dependent and effector-independent manner, especially during the instructed-delay period.

J	Manns, ID; Alonso, A; Jones, BE				Manns, ID; Alonso, A; Jones, BE			Rhythmically discharging basal forebrain units comprise cholinergic, GABAergic, and putative glutamatergic cells	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article							LONG-TERM POTENTIATION; OLFACTORY-BULB; NUCLEUS BASALIS; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; THETA-ACTIVITY; OSCILLATORY PROPERTIES; HIPPOCAMPAL ACTIVITY; SYNAPTIC PLASTICITY; ENTORHINAL CORTEX; ANESTHETIZED RATS	The basal forebrain plays important roles in arousal, learning, and memory by stimulating cortical activation characterized by rhythmic slow theta and high-frequency beta-gamma activities. Although cholinergic neurons play a significant part in these roles, other, including GABAergic, neurons appear to contribute. Using juxtacellular labeling with neurobiotin of neurons recorded within the magnocellular preoptic-substantia innominata area in urethan-anesthetized rats, we show that in addition to cells that are cholinergic or GABAergic, other cells that are neither fire rhythmically in correlation with stimulation-induced rhythmic slow activity on the cortex. Neurons with the characteristics of the noncholinergic/nonGABAergic cells contain phosphate-activated glutaminase (PAG), the synthetic enzyme for transmitter glutamate and may thus be glutamatergic. Within their oscillatory spike trains, putative glutamatergic neurons fire at a lower frequency (similar to20 Hz) than the GABAergic neurons (similar to40 Hz) and the cholinergic neurons (average: 75 Hz), whose spike trains include high-frequency bursts. The three groups all discharge rhythmically at a slow frequency in correlation with rhythmic slow activity recorded on the prefrontal, entorhinal, piriform and olfactory bulb cortices. The predominant slow frequency corresponds to the respiratory-olfactory rhythm, which is commonly slower than, yet can be as fast as, the hippocampal theta rhythm during certain coordinated behaviors, such as sniffing-whisking. While stimulating higher frequency beta-gamma activities, putative glutamatergic together with GABAergic and cholinergic cells may thus collectively modulate rhythmic slow activity and thereby promote coherent processing and plasticity across distributed cortical networks during coordinated behaviors and states.

We review the 10-year experience of a tertiary care pediatric centre with respect to the surgical management of nonmalignant parotid masses. In total, 15 patients with nonmalignant masses of the parotid gland region underwent surgery. Five children were diagnosed with lymphoepithelial cyst or first branchial cleft cyst. Three children were diagnosed with parotid abscess, one of whom had atypical mycobacteria. Other diagnoses included lymphangioma (three cases), chronic inflammation (two cases), and epidermoid cyst (one case). One patient who presented with a parotid cyst was diagnosed postoperatively with plexiform neurofibroma of the facial nerve. She was the only patient with postoperative facial nerve paresis, affecting the orbital branch. Presentation and postoperative complications of these surgically managed nonmalignant parotid masses are reviewed. The history and physical examination are of the utmost importance in predicting the diagnosis, although ultrasonography and computed tomography can be useful. Fine-needle aspiration cytology was not well tolerated by children and appears of little use as the accurate diagnosis was provided by the surgical pathology specimen.

The pharmacogenetics of morphine analgesia are fairly well characterized, but far less is known about other analgesics. The purpose of this work was to begin the systematic genetic study of non-mu-opioid analgesics. We tested mice of 12 inbred mouse strains for baseline nociceptive sensitivity (49degreesC tail-withdrawal assay) and subsequent antinociceptive sensitivity to systemic administration of (trans) 3,4-dichloro-N-methyl-N-[2-(1-pyrrolidinyl)-cyclohexyl]benzeneacetamide methane-sulfonate hydrate (U50,488; 10-150 mg/kg), a kappa-opioid receptor agonist; (R)-(+)-[2,3-dihydro-5-methyl-3-(4-morpholinylmethyl) pyrrolo[1,2,3-de]-1,4-benzoxazin-6-yl]-1-naphthalenylmethanone (WIN55,212-2; 0.5-480 mg/kg), a synthetic cannabinoid receptor agonist; epibatidine (7.5-150 mug/kg), a nicotinic receptor agonist; clonidine (0.1-5 mg/kg), an alpha(2)-adrenergic receptor agonist; and, for purposes of comparison, the prototypic mu-opioid receptor agonist, morphine (5-200 mg/kg). Robust interstrain variability was observed in nociceptive sensitivity and in the antinociceptive effects of each of the drugs, with extreme-responding strains exhibiting antinociceptive potencies differing up to 37-fold. Unexpectedly, we observed moderate-to-high genetic correlations of strain sensitivities to the five drugs (r = 0.39-0.77). We also found moderate-to-high correlations between baseline nociceptive sensitivity and subsequent analgesic response to each drug (r = 0.33-0.68). The generalizability of these findings was established in follow-up experiments investigating morphine and clonidine inhibition of formalin test nociception. Despite the fact that each drug activates a unique receptor, our results suggest that the potency of each drug is affected by a common set of genes. However, the genes in question may affect antinociception indirectly, via a primary action on baseline nociceptive sensitivity.

Kinematic data were obtained from gender- and age-matched stuttering (n = 10) and nonstuttering (n = 10) adults during speech movements, orofacial nonspeech movements, and finger movements. All movements were performed in 4 conditions differing in sequence length and location of the target movement within the sequence. Results revealed statistically significant differences between the stuttering and nonstuttering individuals on several measures of lip and jaw closing (but not opening) movements during perceptually fluent speech. The magnitude of these differences varied across different levels of utterance length (larger differences during shorter utterances) and across different locations of the target movement within an utterance (larger differences close to the beginning). Results further revealed statistically significant differences between the stuttering and nonstuttering groups in finger flexion (but not extension) movement duration and peak velocity latency. Overall, findings suggest that differences between stuttering and nonstuttering individuals are not confined to the sensorimotor processes underlying speech production or even movements of the orofacial system in general. Rather, it appears that the groups show generalized differences in the duration of certain goal-directed movements across unrelated motor systems.

These NRs mediate the activation of pituitary proopiomelanocortin (POMC) gene transcription by the hypothalamic hormone corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), an important link between neuronal and endocrine components of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis. CRH effects on POMC transcription do not require de novo protein synthesis. We now show that CRH signals activate Nur factors through the cyclic AMP/protein kinase A (PKA) pathway. CRH and PKA rapidly increase nuclear DNA binding activity of NGFI-B dimers but not monomers. Accordingly, CRH-or PKA-activated Nur factors enhance dimer (but not monomer) target response elements. We also show that p160/SRC coactivators are recruited to Nur dimers (but not to monomers) and that coactivator recruitment to the NurRE is enhanced in response to CRH. Moreover, PKA-and coactivator-induced potentiation of NGFI-B activity are primarily exerted through the N-terminal AF-1 domain of NGFI-B. The TIF2 (SRC-2) glutamine-rich domain is required for this activity. Taken together, these results indicate that Nur factors behave as endpoint effectors of the PKA signaling pathway acting through dimers and AF-1-dependent recruitment of coactivators.

Electrophysiological properties of tibial motoneurons were measured in situ in anesthetized (ketamine/xylazine) control and trained rats using sharp glass microelectrodes. Motoneurons from trained rats had significantly hyperpolarized resting membrane potentials and spike trigger levels, and faster antidromic spike rise-times. "Fast" motoneurons (after-hyperpolarization half-decay time <20 ms) in trained rats also had a significantly larger mean cell capacitance than those in control rats, suggesting that they were larger, although this had no effect on indices of excitability (rheobase, cell input resistance). Motoneurons are thus targets for activity-induced adaptations, which may have clinical significance for the role of physical activity as a therapeutic modality in cases of neurological deficit. The specific adaptations noted, which reflect alterations in ionic conductances, may serve to offset decreases in membrane excitability that occur during sustained excitation.

Here we report that crosslinking Fas on primary sensory neurons induces neurite growth through sustained activation of the extracellular-signal regulated kinase (ERK) pathway and the consequent upregulation of p35, a mediator of neurite outgrowth. In addition, functional recovery after sciatic nerve injury is delayed in Fas-deficient lpr mice and accelerated by local administration of antibodies against Fas, which indicates that Fas engagement may contribute to nerve regeneration in vivo. Our findings define a role for Fas as an inducer of both neurite growth in vitro and accelerated recovery after nerve injury in vivo.

Injured animals vaccinated with SCH showed axon growth into the optic nerve and such regeneration was not observed in animals vaccinated with liver homogenate (LH). Regeneration was not a consequence of neuroprotection since our vaccine did not protect RGCs from axotomy-induced cell death. Sera of vaccinated animals were tested for antibodies against myelin-associated glycoprotein, NogoA, Nogo-66 receptor, or chondroitin sulphate proteoglycans (CSPG), but no significant levels were detected. Antibodies to myelin basic protein were present in the serum of some SCH-vaccinated animals. In culture, serum from SCH-vaccinated animals promoted RGC growth on myelin but not on CSPG. Our results show that the effect of the pro-regenerative vaccine is mediated by antibodies to SCH. However, we were not able to detect a significant immune reaction to growth inhibitory proteins, suggesting alternative mechanisms for the success of vaccination to promote regeneration.

With the advances in modern neurochemistry, it is becoming increasingly clear that a chronic seizure predisposition or a lowering of the brain's discharge threshold can be demarcated by a number of biochemical markers. They include a tendency for an increased release of glutamate with or without GABAergic impairment, (intra) neural tissue alterations in water redistribution/osmolarity or other distortions of the cytoarchitecture, and an elevation of ionic calcium inside the cell. These changes are dominantly shared parameters of the seizure prone brain. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) shows that cerebral levels of glutamate + glutamine (Glx) are increased interictally in epileptogenic regions in human partial epilepsy; other findings using this technique suggest damage to (cellular/mitochondrial) membranes, denoted by N-acetyl-aspartic acid (NAA) changes and a decreased energy capability (1). The merging of previous in vitro and ex vivo findings in neurophysiology and neurochemistry with magnetic resonance spectroscopy technology provides a powerful new methodology to interpret and to obtain clinical insight into the metabolic alterations that underlie an epileptogenic process. In this review some of these basic neurochemical and electrophysiological mechanisms are discussed. In addition, certain adjuncts to established antiepileptic drug therapy are suggested in the hope that over the long term they may help in correcting the primary metabolic deficits.

The cerebral cortex has the topology of a 2D highly convoluted sheet. As the brain develops over time, the cortical surface area, thickness, curvature, and total gray matter volume change. It is highly likely that such age-related surface changes are not uniform. By measuring how such surface metrics change over time, the regions of the most rapid structural changes can be localized. We avoided using surface flattening, which distorts the inherent geometry of the cortex in our analysis and it is only used in visualization. To increase the signal to noise ratio, diffusion smoothing, which generalizes Gaussian kernel smoothing to an arbitrary curved cortical surface, has been developed and applied to surface data. Afterward, statistical inference on the cortical surface will be performed via random fields theory. As an illustration, we demonstrate how this new surface-based morphometry can be applied in localizing the cortical regions of the gray matter tissue growth and loss in the brain images longitudinally collected in the group of children and adolescents.

With respect to this issue, positron emission tomography (PET) findings indicate that cognitive and behavioral modifications, occurring in a psychotherapeutic context, can lead to regional brain metabolic changes in patients with major depression or obsessive-compulsive disorder. The goal of the present functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study, which constitutes the first neuroimaging investigation of the effects of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) using an emotional activation paradigm, was to probe the effects of CBT on the neural correlates of spider phobia. In order to do so, fMRI was used in subjects suffering from spider phobia (n = 12) to measure, before and after effective CBT, regional brain activity during the viewing of film excerpts depicting spiders. Normal control subjects were also scanned (once) while they were exposed to the same film excerpts. Results showed that, in phobic subjects before CBT, the transient state of fear triggered, during the viewing of the phobogenic stimuli, was correlated with significant activation of the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (Brodmann area-BA 10), the parahippocampal gyrus, and the visual associative cortical areas, bilaterally. For normal control subjects (n = 13), only the left middle occipital gyrus and the right inferior temporal gyrus were significantly activated. In phobic subjects before CBT, the activation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (BA 10) may reflect the use of metacognitive strategies aimed at self-regulating the fear triggered by the spider film excerpts, whereas the parahippocampal activation might be related to an automatic reactivation of the contextual fear memory that led to the development of avoidance behavior and the maintenance of spider phobia. After successful completion of CBT, no significant activation was found in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (BA 10) or the parahippocampal gyrus. These findings suggest that a psychotherapeutic approach, such as CBT, has the potential to modify the dysfunctional neural circuitry associated with anxiety disorders. They further indicate that the changes made at the mind level, within a psychotherapeutic context, are able to functionally "rewire" the brain. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science (USA). All rights reserved.

In a randomized, double-blind two session (tryptophan depletion [TD] vs. nondepletion), placebo-controlled design, spectrally analyzed electroencephalogram (EEG), self-ratings of withdrawal symptoms and mood states were assessed in 18 male cigarette smokers before smoking abstinence, 5 h postsmoking abstinence and again following sham smoking and the smoking of one cigarette. Compared to a nutritionally balanced amino acid (AA) mixture containing tryptophan (i.e., placebo mixture), oral ingestion of a similar mixture devoid of tryptophan resulted in a 70% reduction of plasma tryptophan but failed to alter the appearance or reversal (by acute cigarette smoking) of withdrawal symptoms, negative mood states and increased slow wave EEG in male smokers deprived of cigarettes. These results, although not supporting a role for the serotonergic system in acute smoking and early smoking abstinence symptoms, are discussed in relation to the neuropharmacology of smoking behavior and suggestions for future work.

The authors conducted selective computerized and manual reviews of the literature concerning the history of trauma-related disorders. Exposure to overwhelming terror can lead to troubling memories, which has been a central theme in the literature since the time of Gilgamesh. Reexperiencing was well known and conversion reactions were described, but until the 18th century chroniclers and philosophers essentially reported anecdotes. Nostalgia and traumatic neurosis were first identified during the American Civil War and after the first railway crashes in the 19th century. The isolated anecdote thus evolved into a clinical entity whose medical and psychiatric complexity underwent large-scale development during and immediately after World War I. An historical approach of traumatic disorders identification provides an integrated view of multiple psychological symptoms, some included and others not included in current post-traumatic syndromes.

Recently, we have revisited the hypothesis that reactivation of a consolidated memory can return it to a labile, sensitive state - in which it can be modified, strengthened, changed or even erased! The data generated from some of the best-described paradigms in memory research, in conjunction with powerful neurobiological technologies, have provided striking support for a very dynamic neuro-biological basis of memory, which is beginning to overturn the old dogma.

Methods: The authors reviewed the charts of all children who underwent anterior temporal lobectomy for refractory TLE from 1979 through 1999. A new neuropathologic analysis was performed blinded to clinical features and outcome. Results: Twenty-two children met inclusion criteria. Mean age at onset of epilepsy was 3 years, 7 months (range 1 month to 10 years). Mean age at surgery was 10 years, 11 months (range 1 to 18 years). All patients had complex partial seizures, 48% with secondary generalization. Most had daily seizures. Auras were reported in 45% of patients. Post-resection follow-up averaged 5 years, 2 months (range 2 to 19 years). Seizure-free status was achieved in 41% of patients, and 14% had residual auras only. The most frequent neuropathologic abnormalities were cortical dysplasia (CD) of the temporal neocortex (14 of 22) and mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS) (12 of the 15 children with available hippocampal tissue). These two findings coexisted in seven children. MTS was associated with extra-hippocampal pathology in 8 of 12 (67%) of the cases. Conclusions: NITS occurs frequently in association with CD in this population of children. The high incidence of dual pathology could explain the early age of seizure onset and high seizure frequency rate observed. TLE in childhood may constitute a different entity than in adults, from both the clinical and neuropathologic perspectives.

Although transgenic replacement of systemic or adipose, but not renal, AGT in AGT-deficient mice has previously been reported to correct some of these renal abnormalities, the tissue target for this complementation has not been defined. In the current study, we have used a novel transgenic strategy to restore the peptide product of the renin-angiotensin system, angiotensin II, exclusively in the brain of AGT-deficient mice and demonstrate that brain-specific angiotensin 11 can correct the hydronephrosis and partially correct renal dysfunction seen in AGT-deficient mice. Taken together, these results suggest that the renin-angiotensin system affects renal development and function through systemically accessible targets in the brain.

In the present study, we demonstrate that central administration of LPS via intrathecal (i.t.) injection produces bilateral tactile allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia in the rat. Also, the effects of morphine-induced antinociception were determined in this model. Here we demonstrate enhanced thermal antinociceptive potency of i.t. morphine in LPS-treated rats compared to controls. Intrathecal morphine was also effective in alleviating the tactile allodynia induced by LPS. Both the antinociceptive and anti-allodynic effects produced by i.t. morphine were completely antagonized by pretreatment with subcutaneous naloxone (1 mg kg(-1)). This study demonstrates the presence of both heat hyperalgesia and mechanical allodynia following central administration of LPS, and an increased antinociceptive potency of i.t. morphine in this model.

PGI contains a CXXC motif, characteristic of redox proteins and possibly evolutionarily related to the CC and CXC motif of the chemokine gene family. Using site-directed mutagenesis, single- and double-deletion (CXC, CC) mutants were created by deleting amino acids 331 and 332 of human PGI, respectively. The mutant proteins lost their enzymatic activity; however, neither of the deletions augmented the proteins' binding affinity to the receptor and all maintained cytokine function. The results demonstrate that the enzymatic activity of PGI is not essential for either receptor binding or cytokine function of human PGI. (C) 2002 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.

Wortmannin (a phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor) caused similar to30% reduction of HERG current (I-HERG) stably expressed in HEK293 cells. Transient transfection with the constitutively active PI3K in HERG-expressing HEK293 cells slightly increased (similar to7%) I-HERG while a dominant negative PI3K significantly reduced I-HERG (similar to25%) relative to results in vehicle-transfected cells. I-HERG was similar to35% greater in cells transfected with the constitutively activated PKB (caPKB), whereas it was similar to47% smaller in cells transfected with dominant negative PKB (dnPKB). Basal activation of PKB was detected by immunocytochemistry. PKB activity was significantly enhanced in caPKB-transfected cells and nearly abolished in dnPKB-transfected cells. We conclude that normal HERG function in HEK293 cells requires basal activity of PKB. Our data represent the first evidence that PKB phosphorylation regulates K+ channels.

To assess their putative role in respiratory responses to hypoxia, neurokinin-1, and mu-opioid receptor binding was determined in the respiratory nucleus tractus solitarius of the mature rat after single and recurrent intermittent hypoxia versus normoxia. Hypoxia comprised six 5-min bouts of 8% O-2-92% N-2 interceded by 5-min bouts in 21% O-2-79% N-2 (normoxia), either on 6 consecutive days (recurrent intermittent hypoxia) or on the 6th day only (single intermittent hypoxia). Controls comprised six daily sessions in normoxia. To examine the plasticity in receptor response, brains were collected 5 min, 2 h, or 24 h after the last gaseous exposure. Sections from each brainstem underwent quantitative film autoradiography with iodinated substance P and DAMGO for neurokinin-1 and mu-opioid receptors, respectively. Neurokinin-1 receptor binding decreased 5 min after single and recurrent hypoxia and 2h after recurrent hypoxia, whereas mu-opioid binding remained unchanged. The binding of both receptors increased 24h after recurrent intermittent hypoxia. Neurokinin versus mu-opioid binding differences immediately posthypoxia might affect physiological responses to episodic hypoxia. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

We demonstrated previously that the rate of peripheral nerve regeneration is reduced in galanin knock-out mice, with similar deficits observed in neurite outgrowth from cultured mutant DRG neurons. Here, we show that the addition of galanin peptide significantly enhanced neurite outgrowth from wild-type sensory neurons and fully rescued the observed deficits in mutant cultures. Furthermore, neurite outgrowth in wild-type cultures was reduced to levels observed in the mutants by the addition of the galanin antagonist M35 [galanin(1-13)bradykinin(2-9)]. Study of the first galanin receptor (GalR1) knock-out animals demonstrated no differences in neurite outgrowth compared with wild-type animals. Similarly, use of a GalR1-specific antagonist had no effect on neuritogenesis. In contrast, use of a GalR2-specific agonist had equipotent effects on neuritogenesis to galanin peptide, and inhibition of PKC reduced neurite outgrowth from wild-type sensory neurons to that observed in galanin knock-out cultures. These results demonstrate that adult sensory neurons are dependent, in part, on galanin for neurite extension and that this crucial physiological process is mediated by activation of the GalR2 receptor in a PKC-dependent manner.

These mice have elevated concentrations of A-beta protein (Abeta(42)) in the absence of plaque formation. By comparison to a mixed background strain (50% B6, 25% SJ1, 25% 129Sv) controlled for age and gender, PS1-A246E transgenic mice displayed disinhibitory tendencies, as indicated by increased entries and duration in the open arms of the elevated plus-maze. Despite normal spontaneous alternation rates in a T-maze, latencies before responding were higher in PS1-A246E transgenic mice than controls. Moreover, the PS1-A246E transgenic mice fell more often from two stationary beams, but not from the coat-hanger and the rotorod. By contrast, ambulation in an automated photocell chamber and in an open-field was not affected. Nor was acquisition of place learning in the Morris water maze task. These results indicate that elevated Abeta(42) levels were insufficient for causing spatial defects but caused disinhibition, psychomotor slowing, and loss of motor skills in this model of familial Alzheimer's disease.

S	Galiana, HL		Wolf, LJ; Strock, JL		Galiana, HL			Neural network symmetry supports sensory fusion and motor coordination	1ST INTERNATIONAL IEEE EMBS CONFERENCE ON NEURAL ENGINEERING 2003, CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS	International IEEE EMBS Conference on Neural Engineering		English	Proceedings Paper	1st International IEEE/EMBS Conference on Neural Engineering	MAR 20-22, 2003	CAPRI, ITALY	IEEE, EMBS, Natl Sci Fdn, Medtronic		Neural Topology; sensory-motor mapping; motor strategies	EYE-HEAD COORDINATION; GAZE SHIFTS	The study of binocular control systems has unmasked several advantages linked to the topology of premotor neural networks. Their natural structural symmetry can imbed very complex behaviors in response to sensory patterns such as 1) coordination of vergence and version trajectories in binocular systems, 2) simple fusion of multiple sensory sources with diverse dynamics, 3) automatic selection of appropriate motor strategies and platform coordination, according to bilateral sensory patterns. On-going parameter (circuit) switching can also enable additional modes in each strategy (e.g. saccades vs slow tracking). There are also many levels of symmetry in the circuits controlling limb muscles, for example in the stretch reflex connections of agonist/antagonist muscle groups. The examples here provide evidence that the topological organization of premotor neural networks could play a key role in the process of sensorimotor mapping and in the selection of motor strategies. This is in contrast to the classical approach where desired motor patterns are selected at a cortical level, following several computational stages. These biological aspects can have repercussions in the design of robotic control systems.

We have tested a new technique which allows multiple sources to be used for transmission scans. Each point source is surrounded by plastic scintillator, and the energy the positron must lose before annihilation is collected in the plastic scintillator coupled to a miniature photo-multiplier tube (PMT). The fast trigger from the PMT signals that positron decay has occurred, and arms a circuit to anticipate the arrival of one of the annihilation gamma rays in one of the scanner's conventional detectors. When this occurs a line of response joining the current source position and detector position is identified. This technique has been tested using four Ge-68 sources imbedded in 5 mm diameter plastic cylinders coupled to miniature PMTs on the "ANIPET" small animal PET scanner at the Montreal Neurological Institute. Cross-talk (one plastic scintillator recording a gamma ray from any adjacent source instead of a positron from its own source) was less than 0.5%, and the count rate in one channel was 198 kcps implying a positron detection efficiency of 44%.

Patient motions during exam can corrupt the data analysis in two ways: 1) they may alter ROI-based analysis of dynamic data due to inter-frame shifts. 2) they systematically introduce errors due to emission - transmission data mismatches. In typical data analysis processes, frame alignement is usually performed via registration algorithms which aim at computing the optimal spatial transformation between a target and each frame of the PET volume. Whithin the scope of developing a strategy for systematically correcting dynamic brain volumes, we carried out investigations using simulated data, whose interests were twofold 1) to evaluate separatly the consequences of such effects in typical brain studies and 2) to assess different correction algorithms. From these studies, we conclude than : emission transmission mismatches are major sources of errors by distorting the measured tracer distributions entailing miss-correction in the frame alignement process. Finally, these investigations showed the importance of using external data such as MRI-based volumes for target definition.

The stochastic approximation algorithms require computation of the gradient of the cost function with respect to the parameter that characterizes the randomized policy. This is computed by novel simulation based gradient estimation schemes involving weak derivatives. The algorithms proposed are simulation based and do not require explicit knowledge of the underlying parameters such as transition probabilities. We present three classes of algorithms based on primal dual methods, augmented Lagrangian (multiplier) methods and gradient projection primal methods. Unlike neuro-dynamic programming methods such as Q-Learning, the algorithms proposed here can handle constraints and time varying parameters.

ACTA NEUROCHIRURGICA			English	Article						CSF protein; hydrocephalus; trigeminal schwannoma; vestibular schwannoma	GUILLAIN-BARRE-SYNDROME; CEREBROSPINAL-FLUID; ACOUSTIC NEUROMAS; MANAGEMENT	Background. This series illustrates the association of communicating hydrocephalus with intracranial non-obstructive schwannomas. This association has commonly been observed, hogs ever it has only been reported once previously. Moreover. in all the patients we present. hyperproteinorrhachia was a common denominator. This finding may therefore be the underlying mechanism for hydrocephalus. Method and findings. Seven patients presenting with intracranial schwannomas along with non-obstructive hydrocephalus and hyperproteinorrhachia are reported. Six had a vestibular schwannoma and presented with a unilateral deafness and various degrees of gait disturbance, urinary incontinence and neuropsychological impairment. Due to their advanced ages. these patients underwent a ventriculo-peritoneal shunt, and their symptoms related to hydrocephalus resolved. One patient that suffered from hemifacial dysesthesia and memory deficits presented with a non-obstructive trigeminal schwannoma. In this case the tumour was removed and the hydrocephalus was consequently reversed, and the CSF protein content normalized. Interpretation. The constant finding of hyperproteinorrhachia in all these patients suggests that a high CSF protein content may be the underlying cause of hydrocephalus through a speculative mechanism of decreased CSF resorption.

The pharmacological reasons for cocaine use in opioid-dependent individuals, however, are poorly understood and little is known about the patterns of heroin and cocaine co-use. We reviewed anecdotal evidence suggesting that cocaine is co-used with opioid drugs in a variety of different patterns, to achieve different goals. Clinical and preclinical experimental evidence indicates that the simultaneous administration of cocaine and heroin (i.e. 'speedball') does not induce a novel set of subjective effects, nor is it more reinforcing than either drug alone, especially when the doses of heroin and cocaine are high. There is mixed evidence that the subjective effects of cocaine are enhanced in individuals dependent on opioids, although it is clear that cocaine can alleviate the severity of symptoms of withdrawal from opioids. We also reviewed preclinical studies investigating possible neurobiological interactions between opioids and cocaine, but the results of these studies have been difficult to interpret mainly because the neurochemical mechanisms mediating the motivational effects of cocaine are modified by dependence on, and withdrawal from, opioid drugs. Our analysis encourages further systematic investigation of cocaine use patterns among opioid-dependent individuals and in laboratory animals. Once clearly identified, pharmacological and neuroanatomical methods can be employed in self-administering laboratory animals to uncover the neurobiological correlates of specific patterns of co-use.

In these patients, the number of functional liver cells is reduced, and some blood is diverted around the liver before toxins are removed. As a result, toxins such as ammonia and manganese can accumulate in the blood and enter the brain, where they can damage nerve cells and supporting cells called astrocytes. Positron emission tomography analyses have determined that ammonia levels are elevated in the brains of HE patients; ammonia accumulation can alter the expression of various important brain genes. Magnetic resonance images show that manganese is deposited in a brain area called the globus pallidus; manganese deposits may be responsible for structural changes in the astrocytes that are characteristic of HE. Treatment of patients with HE involves measures to lower ammonia levels in the blood, medications to counteract ammonia's effects on brain cell function, devices to compensate for liver dysfunction, and liver transplantation.

Whether airway smooth muscle cells (ASMC) may react directly to SP through expression of the NK-1 receptor or express the gene for the synthesis of SP, the PPT-A gene, is unknown. We demonstrated using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction that tracheal SMC (TSMC) from atopic Brown Norway rats contained mRNA transcripts for the full-length isoform of the NK-1 receptor. Flow cytometric analysis indicated that the NK-1 receptor was expressed on the surface of TSMC. This receptor was functional as demonstrated by calcium mobilization in response to SP stimulation. The expression of the NK-1 receptor was not altered in passively sensitized TSMC in response to antigenic stimulation, although this stimulation increased the expression of the chemokine RANTES (regulated on activation, normal T cells expressed and secreted). Using different sets of PCR primers, we showed that TSMC also express the beta, alpha, and its alternative splicing product delta, and possibly the gamma mRNA transcript isoforms of the PPT-A gene. Gene sequencing of the PCR-amplified beta isoform confirmed that it is a transcript product of the rat PPT-A gene, and the production of SP by TSMC was confirmed by enzyme immunoassay. We also showed the beta isoform increased after cell stimulation with rat sera, whether sensitized or not. In conclusion, both the PPT-A gene and NK-1 receptors are expressed by TSMC, which suggests the possibility of autocrine neuropeptidergic mechanisms in these cells. However, these mechanisms are not upregulated by passive sensitization.

J	Stewart, J				Stewart, J			Stress and relapse to drug seeking: Studies in laboratory animals shed light on mechanisms and sources of long-term vulnerability	AMERICAN JOURNAL ON ADDICTIONS			English	Article							CORTICOTROPIN-RELEASING-FACTOR; CONDITIONED PLACE PREFERENCE; FACTOR-LIKE IMMUNOREACTIVITY; MESSENGER-RNA EXPRESSION; BRAIN-STIMULATION REWARD; INDUCED REINSTATEMENT; STRIA TERMINALIS; BED NUCLEUS; COCAINE SEEKING; HEROIN-SEEKING	Relapse is a major characteristic of drug addiction disorders and remains the primary problem for treatment. Recently, there has been hope that these disorders may be amenable to pharmacological treatments that have successfully treated other psychopathological disorders. Pharmacological approaches to drug abuse have tended to be guided by the primary drug used by the individual, though substitution has been the guiding principle in some instances, as in the case of methadone maintenance in opioid addiction. Alternatively, blockade or antagonism of the effects of the primary drug being abused has been tried, as in the case of using naltrexone to treat opioid or alcohol addiction. Though reportedly successful in some populations, it is not clear that these approaches effectively control craving for 'highs' or euphoric experiences or a return to drug use as a response to stressful life experiences. Recent experimental studies of the factors that induce craving and relapse to drug use in both humans and laboratory animals, such as drug-related cues, re-exposure to the drug itself, or exposure to stressful events, have shown that the effects of these different events are mediated by dissociable neurochemical circuitry. Another finding that emerges from these studies is that the motivation underlying drug seeking induced by events that precipitate relapse is intensified by the duration and amount of pre-exposure to a drug and the passage of time since withdrawal of the drug. One implication of such findings for the treatment of addiction is that whatever approach is taken, treatment will have to be multifaceted and maintained over an extended period of time after the initial termination of drug use.

Selected subjects tolerated the study well without pump malfunction. The NAA to creatine (Cr) intensity ratio (NAA/Cr) was measured in the precentral and postcentral gyri, the superior parietal lobule, the supplementary motor area, and the premotor cortex. After 4.5 +/- 0.6 weeks treatment, NAA/Cr did not change significantly in any of the regions in the BDNF-treated group (n=5) compared to the placebo group (n=6). The lack of change in NAA correlated with the lack of clinical efficacy and supports the validity of NAA/ Cr as a surrogate in this setting. MRSI is a feasible and safe method to evaluate intrathecal therapies in ALS.

Moreover, studies that looked at this question using a production oral naming task offered contradictory results, partly because of differences in production criteria used for this task. Aims : The goal of this study was to investigate the contribution of the right hemisphere to lexico-semantic abilities using an unconstrained oral naming task, looking at both qualitative and qualitative dimensions of the words produced, including a time-course analysis. Methods and Procedure : A total of 30 right-hemisphere-damaged (RHD), 30 left-hemisphere-damaged (LHD) without aphasia or with only a mild aphasia, and 30 control subjects (NC) were submitted to an unconstrained oral naming task. Outcome and Results : Results showed that hemisphere-damaged subjects produced fewer words than NC and that LHD produced fewer semantic categories than NC and RHD. Time-course analysis showed that, for all groups, more words were produced at the beginning of the task. Qualitatively, RHD showed a tendency to produce a lower mean degree of prototypicality than NC. Finally, the cluster analysis identified three clusters according to the overall performance, revealing an interaction between education and the presence of a brain lesion. Conclusion : Altogether, these results indicate that the impairment of the semantic processing of words following a right-hemisphere lesion might be specifically determined by the prototypicality of words, a result that has some convergence with other results in the literature at the discourse or pragmatic levels. However, results also show the existence of an interaction between the ability to look at very mild lexico-semantic impacts of a brain lesion and the influence of degree of education on these abilities. The latter result stresses the importance of a strict control of education in any studies looking at very mild language disorders in brain-lesioned individuals.

This function yielded a novel description of the mechanism of flow-metabolism coupling. The description revealed that constant oxygen consumption is not maintained by saturation of cytochrome oxidase but by adjustment of the enzyme's affinity towards oxygen. Interactions of oxygen and a factor that could be nitric oxide, at both cytochrome oxidase and nitric oxide synthase, match the affinities of both enzymes towards their respective substrates to the oxygen requirement of the tissue and, in doing so, explain several properties of flow-metabolism coupling.

Group studies of patients with unilateral epileptic foci and other studies of patients with unilateral brain lesions have come to the same conclusion. The present study reviewed previously published single case reports of patients with frank hypo or hypersexuality subsequent to a unilateral brain lesion. Hyposexual patients tended to have left hemisphere lesions (primarily of the temporal lobe), and hypersexual patients tended to have right hemisphere lesions (primarily of the temporal lobe) (p < 0.05). We interpret this double dissociation as part of a more general phenomenon of psychic tone similarly dissociated with regard to hemispheric control. including mood, psychomotor baseline, speech rate, and even immunity. The behavioral significance of this psychic tone is to modulate approach versus avoidance behavior.

The ultradian rhythm of GH secretion is generated by the intricate patterned release of two hypothalamic hormones, somatostatin (SRIF) and GH-releasing hormone (GHRH), acting both at the level of the pituitary gland and within the central nervous system. The recent discovery of ghrelin, a novel GH-releasing peptide identified as the endogenous ligand for the GH-secretagogue receptor (GHS-R) and shown to induce a positive energy balance, suggests the existence of an additional neuroendocrine pathway for GH control. To further understand how ghrelin interacts with the classical GHRH/SRIF neuronal system in GH regulation, we used a combined physiological and histochemical approach. Our physiologic studies of the effects of ghrelin on spontaneous pulsatile GH secretion in conscious, free-moving rats demonstrate that: 1) ghrelin, administered peripherally, exerts potent, time-dependent GH-releasing activity under physiological conditions; 2) ghrelin is a functional antagonist of SRIF, but its GH-releasing activity is not dependent on inhibiting endogenous SRIF release; 3) SRIF antagonizes the action of ghrelin acting at the level of the pituitary gland; and 4) the GH response to ghrelin requires an intact endogenous GHRH system. Our dual chromogenic and autoradiographic in situ hybridization experiments provide anatomical evidence that ghrelin may directly modulate GHRH mRNA- and NPY mRNA-containing neurons in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus, but that SRIF mRNA-expressing cells in the periventricular nucleus are not major direct targets for ghrelin. Together, these findings support the notion that ghrelin may be a critical hormonal signal of nutritional status to the GH neuroendocrine axis serving to integrate energy balance and the growth process.

Short-time desensitization (5 min) of PI hydrolysis occurred without receptor internalization and reached 54% by 1 h. The same treatment decreased cell surface receptors labelled with the non-permeable ligand [H-3]-NMS by 47%, while total receptor density ([H-3]-scopolamine binding) decreased by 30%. Longer CCh treatment down-regulated receptors by 70% and desensitized the PI response by 80%. 4 Although protein kinase C (PKC) activation desensitized mAChR, CCh-mediated desensitization was independent of PKC. 5 Inhibition of receptor endocytosis by low temperature during the pre-stimulation period or in the presence of hyperosmotic sucrose (0.5 M) blocked desensitization, receptor, internalization and down-regulation. 6 Recover of surface mAChR and their functional activity following down-regulation was slow, returning to control levels by 24 h after agonist removal. In progenitor cells, dose-response curves for CCh-mediated PI hydrolysis and c-fos mRNA expression showed that newly synthesized mAChR were supersensitive after recovery. 7 Overall. the present results provide evidence of functional agonist-mediated mAChR regulation in brain oligodendroglial cells.

Clinical features: A 41-yr-old woman underwent laparotomy for total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo- oophorectomy under general anesthesia. She received a total of 500 mug of fentanyl by iv intermittent boluses during the three-hour anesthetic. During emergence from anesthesia, while intubated, the patient presented with rigidity. No changes in ventilatory parameters were measured during the episode. The only notable predisposing factor was treatment with venlafexine, an antidepressant that modifies serotonin and norepinephrine levels. She was successfully treated with iv naloxone 20 mug. The rest of the postoperative period was uneventful. Conclusion: We observed an atypical case of opioid-induced rigidity in contrast to the classical syndrome, which presents at induction with high-dose opioids. This syndrome has many clinical presentations with neurologic and ventilatory signs of varying intensity. Early recognition of the syndrome and adequate treatment is crucial. If treated adequately, opioid-induced rigidity is self-limited with few complications.

Materials and methods: HPLC was used to determine the half-life (t(1/2)) of FD137 and to characterize its derived metabolite FD110. The dual mechanisms of DNA damaging and EGFR tyrosine kinase (TK) targeting were ascertained by the comet assay for DNA damage and by inmunodetection of phosphotyrosine in an ELISA and a whole-cell assay for EGFR-mediated signaling. The antiproliferative effects of the different drugs and their combinations were determined by the sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay. Results: In contrast to BCNU, FD137 significantly blocked EGF-induced EGFR autophosphorylation (IC50 4 muM) in the human solid tumor cell line A431. DNA damage induced by FD137 could only be observed after 24 h exposure, but the level of DNA damage remained 3.6-fold lower than that induced by BCNU. This difference was rationalized by the 160-fold greater stability of FD137 when compared with BCNU in serum-containing medium. Further, degradation of FD13 7 was accompanied by the slow release of FD110, an extremely potent inhibitor of EGFR TK [IC50 (EGFR autophosphorylation) < 0.3 muM]. The complex properties of FD137 translated into a 55-fold greater antiproliferative activity than BCNU against the EGFR-overexpressing A431 cells that coexpresses the O-6-alkylguanine transferase (AGT). Depletion of AGT in these cells by the use of O-6-benzylguanine (O-6-BG) enhanced their sensitivity to BCNU by 8-fold but only by 3-fold to FD137. Conclusions: The results, overall suggest that the superior antiproliferative activity of FD137 when compared with BCNU may be associated with its ability to behave as a combination,of many species with different mechanisms of action.

Available techniques do not allow the adequate voiding due to the dyssynergia between the bladder and the sphincter. We proposed a new integrated stimulator designed to allow the recuperation of the bladder functions. The stimulation system which is an integrated version of a previously proposed stimulator made by our research team has been extended with some new functionalities. It performs flexible selective stimulations for bladder voiding, a continuous stimulation for suppression of the bladder hyperreflexia and includes a measurement technique to monitor the electrodes-nerve contact allowing the detection of any variation of the nerve impedance or breaking of the electrodes. The stimulation parameters (amplitude, width, frequency) are sent wirelessly by an external controller and are stored in a RAM. An on-chip calibration circuitry provides an efficient and reliable stimulation technique and a voltage regulator supplies the power for the digital core. The modular architecture of the design makes the device an expandable multichannel stimulation system. The stimulator has been designed in the CMOS 0.18 mum technology and can supply up to 3 mA in a 1 kOmega resistive load. It is a complete and efficient stimulation system using fully programmable parameters allowing the recuperation of the bladder functions.

The first prototype merges sixteen 316L stainless steel electrodes on a 4x4 array. Several arrays can then be assembled together in a mosaic configuration to cover a large portion of the visual area. To reduce brain injuries while maximizing the quality of the phosphenes, the electrodes must be sharp, thin (50 mum-diameter), separated 400 mum apart and have stimulation sites located at 1.5 mm under the surface of the cortex. Using electrical discharge machining followed by an electrochemical surface treatment, it has been shown that it was possible to reach such geometrical ratios at this scale. This technique can be combined with electrodeposition of porous platinum to create low impedance stimulation sites. Encapsulation and biocompatibility of the array are also discussed.

This application calls for very low power and low voltage circuit techniques. To satisfy these constraints, the preamplifier is designed in 0.18mum CMOS technology and all employed transistors operate in weak inversion. To maximize the dynamic range of the recorded signals, the preamplifier's gain is set by a 4-bit digital-to-analog converter (DAC). This DAC is used to tune the bias currents of a variable transconductor cell in order to vary its DC gain. The simulation of the whole proposed module gives a maximum power consumption of 530nW at a supply voltage of 0.9V. The circuit provides a maximum gain of 47dB, has a cutoff frequency of 2.65kHz and presents an input-referred noise of 7.65muVrms which is sufficiently low to meet the required precision. In addition, the phase margin is higher than 50degrees on the entire gain range.

The yeast frataxin homologue (yfh1p) is required for cellular respiration. Yfh1p appears to regulate mitochondrial iron homeostasis and protect from free radical toxicity. Complete loss of frataxin in knockout mice leads to early embryonic lethality, indicating an important role for frataxin during development. Heterozygous littermates with partial frataxin deficiency are apparently healthy and have no obvious phenotype. Here we evaluate iron metabolism and sensitivity to dietary and parenteral iron loading in heterozygote frataxin knockout mice (Fx(+/-)). Iron concentrations in the liver, heart, pancreas and spleen, and cellular iron distribution patterns were compared between wild type and Fx(+/-) mice. Response to parenteral iron challenge was not different between Fx(+/-) mice and wild type littermates, while sporadic iron deposits were observed in the hearts of dietary iron-loaded Fx(+/-) mice. Finally, we evaluated the effect of partial frataxin deficiency on susceptibility to cardiac damage in the mouse model of hereditary hemochromatosis (HH), the Hfe knockout mice. HH, an iron overload disease, is one of the most frequent genetic diseases in populations of European origin. By breeding Hfe(-/-) with Fx(+/-) mice, we obtained compound mutant mice lacking both Hfe and one frataxin allele. Sparse iron deposits in areas of mild to moderate cardiac fibrosis were found in the majority of these mice. However, they did not develop any neurological symptoms. Our studies indicate an association between frataxin deficiency, iron deposits and cardiac fibrosis, but no obvious association between iron accumulation and neurodegeneration similar to FRDA could be detected in our model. In addition, these results suggest that frataxin mutations may have a modifier role in HH, that predisposes to cardiomyopathy.

A dissociation between place and cued learning in the Morris water maze has been observed in several models, including cerebellar mutant mice (Rora(sg) Nna1(pcd-1J), nervous), rats with lesions of either the lateral cerebellar cortex or the dentate nucleus, and rats with selective Purkinje cell loss caused by intracerebroventricular injections of OX-7-saporin, confirming the hypothesis that cerebellar damage may cause a cognitive deficit independently of fine motor control. In addition, the results of hemi-cerebellectomized rats indicate the probable involvement of the cerebellum in working memory and the procedural aspect of maze learning. The findings of impaired maze learning in cerebellar-lesioned mice and rats are concordant with those of deficient visuospatial functions in patients with cerebellar atrophy. The spatial deficits may be ascribed to altered metabolic activity in cerebellar-related pathways.

Methods: Automated spike detections were acquired from 26 patients undergoing prolonged electroencephalograph (EEG) monitoring. Data from 6 patients were used to develop the method and data from 20 patients were used to test the method, To provide a standard against which to evaluate the results, an electroencephalographer (EEGer) visually categorized all automated detections before the dipole models were calculated for all events. The event categories (as defined by the EEGer) were then combined with properties of the dipole model and features were identified that differentiated spike and artefact detections. The resulting method was then applied to the testing data set. Results: Residual variance and eccentricity of the dipole models differentiated artefact and spike detections. A separate set of rules defining eye blink artefact was also developed. The combined criteria removed a mean of 53.2% of artefact from the testing data set. Some spike detections (4.3%) were also lost. Conclusions: The features of the dipole source of a detected event can be used to differentiate artefacts from spikes. This algorithm is computationally light and could be implemented on-line. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

The inherent activity of the neurons is controlled by a set of three delay differential equations. We take into account time delays due to propagational and synaptical delays, nonlinearities due to the synaptic transmission process and the spike generation. Intermittent synchronized network activity is observed. A mechanism for this self organized activity is proposed and bases on the occurrence and propagation of bursting activity.

The consequences of SB may include tooth destruction, jaw pain, headaches, or the limitation of mandibular movement, as well as tooth-grinding sounds that disrupt the sleep of bed partners. SB is probably an extreme manifestation of a masticatory muscle activity occurring during the sleep of most normal subjects, since RMMA is observed in 60% of normal sleepers in the absence of grinding sounds. The pathophysiology of SB is becoming clearer, and there is an abundance of evidence outlining the neurophysiology and neurochemistry of rhythmic jaw movements (RJM) in relation to chewing, swallowing, and breathing. The sleep literature provides much evidence describing the mechanisms involved in the reduction of muscle tone, from sleep onset to the atonia that characterizes rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Several brainstem structures (e.g., reticular pontis oralis, pontis caudalis, parvocellularis) and neurochemicals (e.g., serotonin, dopamine, gamma aminobutyric acid [GABA], noradrenaline) are involved in both the genesis of RJM and the modulation of muscle tone during sleep. It remains unknown why a high percentage of normal subjects present RMMA during sleep and why this activity is three times more frequent and higher in amplitude in SB patients. It is also unclear why RMMA during sleep is characterized by co-activation of both jaw-opening and jaw-closing muscles instead of the alternating jaw-opening and jaw-closing muscle activity pattern typical of chewing. The final section of this review proposes that RMMA during sleep has a role in lubricating the upper alimentary tract and increasing airway patency. The review concludes with an outline of questions for future research.

OPMD is usually transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait (OMIM 164300). A rarer allelic autosomal recessive form has also been observed (OMIM 257950). Both forms are caused by short (GCG)(8-13) expansions in the polyadenylate-binding protein nuclear I gene (PABPN 1) located on chromosome 14q 11.1. The mutations cause the lengthening of an N-terminal polyalanine domain. Both slippage and unequal recombination have been proposed as the mutation mechanisms. The size of the mutation has not yet been conclusively shown to inversely correlate with the severity of the phenotype. Mutated PABPN 1 proteins have been shown to be constituents of the INIs. The INIs also contain ubiquitin, proteasome subunits, HSP 40, HSP 70, SKIP, and abundant poly(A)-mRNA. The exact mechanism responsible for polyalanine toxicity in OPMD is unknown. Various intranuclear inclusion dependent and independent mechanisms have been proposed based on the major known function of PABPNI in polyadenylation of mRNA and its shuttling from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. OPMD is one of the few triplet-repeat diseases for which the function of the mutated gene is known. Because of the increasing number of diseases caused by polyalanine expansions and the pathological overlap with CAG/polyglutamine diseases, what pathological insight is gained by the study of OPMD could lead to a better understanding of a much larger group of developmental and degenerative diseases.

Rasmussen encephalitis is a rare progressive disease that causes intractable seizures, cognitive decline, and inflammatory changes in the brain. The neurologic involvement is characteristically unilateral. Bilateral involvement in this case was suspected within 5 months of presentation and was confirmed by bilateral frontal lobe biopsies. The severity and progression of the disease in this case was remarkable and resulted in the patient's death by age 5 years, despite numerous attempted therapeutic interventions. Autopsy findings confirmed the diagnosis of Rasmussen encephalitis with bilateral involvement.

The outcome of cortical excision depends on accurate pre-surgical identification of the epileptogenic tuber. [C-11] alpha-methyl-L-tryptophan (alpha-MTrp) was originally developed to measure serotonin synthesis in vivo with positron emission tomography (PET). However in pathologic conditions its uptake may also depend on the synthesis of quinolinic or kynurenic acid via the kynurenine pathway. Increased levels of serotonin and quinolinic acid have been observed in epileptogenic lesions, raising the possibility that alpha-MTrp PET may localize the epileptogenic area. The aim of this study was to correlate alpha-MTrp PET uptake with the localization of the epileptogenic area and with interictal spike frequency in patients with TSC. alpha-MTrp uptake was measured in 8 patients (2 males, mean age 29.6+/-14.9 years, range 3-50 years) with intractable partial epilepsy due to TSC. All patients underwent scalp EEG monitoring during the PET scan. In four (50%), increased uptake of alpha-MTrp occurred in the epileptogenic area alone. Two (25%) patients showed multifocal abnormalities and the remaining two (25%) did not show focal changes. PET localization was mostly seen in patients with frequent interictal abnormalities on the EEG. Furthermore, there was a significant correlation between alpha-MTrp uptake and the frequency of interictal spikes (r = 0.6; P < 0.05). alpha-MTrp PET is a promising diagnostic tool in the localization of the epileptogenic area in patients with TSC.

The rats were anesthetized and placed in a stereotaxic apparatus. After midline incision four screw electrodes were placed over the left and right frontal and parietal cortex and KA was injected into left dorsal hippocampus via 5-mul Hamilton microsyringe. The changes in electroencephalograph (EEG) activity and EEG power spectra were recorded in basal conditions and 5, 10, 15, 30 and 60 min following KA injection. KA-induced excitatory changes in the surface EEG activity were associated with the marked increase in EEG power spectra in the frequency range from 14.5-22 Hz. Pretreatment with nifedipine, nicardipine and nimodipine revealed that they exerted certain differences in their anticonvulsant properties. Nimodipine significantly delayed the onset of seizures and prevented the KA-induced changes in EEG and in EEG power spectra in all recorded channels and in a dose dependent manner. Nifedipine exerted significant anticonvulsant effect only in channel four, while nicardipine was ineffective. Our results suggest that anticonvulsant action of some dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, especially nimodipine may be in part independent of its antagonism on L-type voltage-gated calcium (Ca2+) channels.

It allows for a quantitative and qualitative assessment of the intensity, location, and nature of experienced pain, as well as conditions that relieve pain. Data collected from one hundred patients attending the Zwai Health Center indicated that 81% reported pain at the time, one-quarter of whom were in severe pain. The most commonly chosen descriptors were burning, stabbing, sore, gnawing, aching, and cramping. Descriptors were often associated with certain diagnoses: burning with gastrointestinal problems, stabbing with respiratory diseases, and gnawing or aching with myalgial/neuralgia. Approximately 40% of those in pain had previously sought relief from a clinic or pharmacy and were attending the center because the pain persisted. Analgesics were more likely to be prescribed for chose in mild pain, while other medication without analgesics were prescribed for those in severe pain. The McGill Pain Questionnaire Amharic (MPQ-Am) could be a useful tool for future studies of illness-specific pain, and of the effectiveness of pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical strategies for pain management.

Both PACAP and NGF elicited rapid neurite outgrowth, which was accompanied by induction of cell excitability and the development of both sodium and calcium currents. Concurrently, PACAP and NGF increased the expression of a marker of synaptic vesicles. By contrast, PACAP, but not NGF, regulated the expression of different constituents of neuroendocrine large dense core vesicles in PC12 cells. Furthermore, PACAP and NGF differentially regulated the expression of mammalian achaete-scute homologue and paired homeobox 2b genes, transcription factors instrumental for sympathoadrenal development. To compare downstream effectors activated by PACAP and NGF, we studied the effects of these factors on the binding activity of consensus 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate- and cAMP-responsive elements to nuclear extracts of differentiating PC12 cells. We found that both PACAP and NGF markedly increase the binding activity of these cis -regulatory sequences and that PACAP preferentially recruits activator protein-1-like transcription factors to these elements. Taken together, these results show that PACAP and NGF exert common as well as different effects on neuronal and neuroendocrine traits in differentiating PC12 cells, strongly suggesting that these two trophic factors could play complementary roles in the development of the sympathoadrenal cell lineage.

One such centre, the mesencephalic locomotor region (MLR), was identified physiologically at the mesopontine border. Descending inputs from the MLR are relayed by reticulospinal neurons in the pons and medulla, but the mechanisms by which this is carried out remain unknown. Because previous studies in higher vertebrates and lampreys described cholinergic cells within the MLR region, we investigated the putative role of cholinergic agonists in the MLR-controlled locomotion. The local application of either acetylcholine or nicotine exerted a direct dose-dependent excitation on reticulospinal neurons as well as induced active or fictive locomotion. It also accelerated ongoing fictive locomotion. Choline acetyltransferase-immunoreactive cells were found in the region identified as the MLR of lampreys and nicotinic antagonists depressed, whereas physostigmine enhanced the compound EPSP evoked in reticulospinal neurons by electrical stimulation of this region. In addition, cholinergic inputs from the MLR to reticulospinal neurons were found to be monosynaptic. When the brainstem was perfused with d-tubocurarine, the induction of swimming by MLR stimulation was depressed, but not prevented, in a semi-intact preparation. Altogether, the results support the hypothesis that cholinergic inputs from the MLR to reticulospinal cells play a substantial role in the initiation and the control of locomotion.

Here we describe the inputs and patterns of firing of NVsnpr neurons during fictive mastication in anaesthetized and paralysed rabbits to determine the role that NVsnpr may play in patterning mastication. Of the 272 neurons recorded in NVsnpr, 107 changed their firing patterns during repetitive stimulation of the left or right sensorimotor cortex to induce fictive mastication. Thirty increased their firing tonically. Seventy-seven became rhythmically active, but only 31 fired in phase with mastication. The others discharged in bursts at more than twice the frequency of trigeminal motoneurons. Most rhythmic masticatory neurons were concentrated in the dorsal part, and those which fired during the jaw closing phase of the cycle were confined to the anterior pole of the nucleus. Most of these cells had inputs from muscle spindle afferents, whereas most of those firing during jaw opening had inputs from periodontal receptors. Non-masticatory rhythmical neurons had receptive fields on the lips and face. The majority of rhythmical masticatory units were modulated during fictive mastication evoked by both the left and right cortices and only four changed their phase of firing when switching from one cortex to the other. When coupled with the finding that NVsnpr neurons exhibit spontaneous bursting in vitro [Sandler et al. (1998) Neuroscience , 83 , 891], the results described here suggest that neurons of dorsal NVsnpr may form the core of the central pattern generator for mastication.

J	Cervero, F; Laird, JMA; Garcia-Nicas, E				Cervero, F; Laird, JMA; Garcia-Nicas, E			Secondary hyperalgesia and presynaptic inhibition: an update	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PAIN			English	Article							DORSAL-ROOT REFLEXES; CAT SPINAL-CORD; JOINT INFLAMMATION; ANTIDROMIC VASODILATATION; CENTRAL SENSITIZATION; MECHANISMS; AFFERENTS; DEPOLARIZATION; ALLODYNIA; RECEPTOR	One of the most prominent features of secondary hyperalgesia is touch-evoked pain, i.e., pain evoked by dynamic tactile stimuli applied to areas adjacent or remote from the originating injury. It is generally accepted that the neurobiological mechanism of this sensory alteration involves the central nervous system (CNS) so that incoming impulses in low-threshold mechanoreceptors from the area of secondary hyperalgesia can evoke painful sensations instead of touch. Some years ago we proposed a mechanistic model for this form of pain based on presynaptic interactions in the spinal dorsal horn between the terminals of low-threshold mechanoreceptors and of nociceptors. Here we review the evidence gathered in support of this model in the intervening years with special reference to experimental studies of antidromic activity (Dorsal Root Reflexes - DRRs) in nociceptive afferents and on the acquisition of low-threshold inputs by nociceptor-specific neurons in the spinal dorsal horn. We also discuss and identify potential molecular mechanisms that may underlie the presynaptic interaction model and therefore that could be responsible for the development of secondary hyperalgesia.

On one side of the animal the motorneurons oscillate synchronously, while on the other side they produce a peristaltic wave of oscillations. Then every 20 heartbeats, approximately, the two sides alternate their activity. These two rhythms, including the transitions between them, are known to be initiated by a Central Pattern Generator (CPG) network of neurons. The translation mechanism from CPG dynamics to motorneuron activity, however, is not well understood. In this work, we use symmetric systems of differential equations, accompanied with computational simulations, to investigate such mechanism.

Methods: The NFL thickness about the optic nerve head and the neural activity of its neurons were quantified by scanning laser polarimetry and pattern reversal electroretinograms (PERGs), respectively, in a group of young healthy volunteers (n =27; mean ocular refraction -1.59+/-0.45 D) between 20 and 31 years of age, and a group of healthy elderly volunteers (n =27; mean ocular refraction +0.11+/-0.40 D) between 75 and 88 years of age. Results: Relative to the young group, the elderly subjects showed an overall thinning of the NFL of some 22.5%; however, the superior quadrant was attenuated by about 30.0%. The function of the ganglion cell axons in the NFL as reflected by the N95 component of the PERG was reduced by about 28.8% in the elderly compared with the young. Conclusion: Aging caused a thinning of the NFL, particularly in the superior quadrant. The evoked potentials from the neurons comprising this layer were attenuated by near equivalent amount. These findings have clinical implications in the differential diagnosis of normal aging versus disease-related alterations in the structure and function of the NFL in the very elderly sector of our population.

Avoiding manipulation of the ascending aorta in this high-risk subgroup may become a necessity to perform safe coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed our database of 640 off-pump CABG patients and identified 84 patients in whom we adopted the "no touch" technique (NTT). Revascularization was carried out with single or bilateral internal thoracic arteries (ITA) and by connecting additional coronary grafts (saphenous vein, radial artery) in a T or Y configuration. The right gastroepiploic artery was used as a conduit in 2 patients. The brachiocephalic artery was used as an alternative inflow site in 3 patients (reoperation). Results: Age, sex, risk factors, functional class, and history of congestive heart failure were comparable in the two groups. In the NTT group, the frequencies were higher for severe atherosclerosis of the aorta (13% versus 0%; P = .00), carotid disease (25% versus 16%; P = .02), and history of previous cerebrovascular accidents (17% versus 8%; P = .04). Complete revascularization was achieved in 96% of the patients in the off-pump CABG group, compared with 90% in the NTT group (P = .17). No differences in the prevalence of postoperative low cardiac output syndrome, intra-aortic balloon pump use, perioperative myocardial infarction, or operative mortality at 30 days were observed between the two groups. In the NTT group, weak trends toward a lower incidence of postoperative delirium (8% versus 15%; P = .12), a lower incidence of stroke (0% versus 1%; P = .85), and a shorter intensive care unit stay (P = .07) were observed. Hospital stay was also shorter in the NTT group (P = .04). Conclusion: Avoiding aortic manipulations in patients with severe atherosclerosis of the aorta, carotid disease, and a previous history of cerebrovascular accidents is technically feasible and is associated with a low risk of mortality and good shortterm results. Adopting this practice may reduce the incidence of stroke and improve early outcome in this subset of patients.

The objective of this study was to compare off-pump to on-pump CABG in patients with known risk factors for mortality and morbidity. Methods: Between October 2001 and September 2002, 65 high-risk patients were prospectively randomized to undergo off-pump or on-pump CABG. Recruited patients had at least 3 of the following criteria: age greater than 65 years, high blood pressure, diabetes, serum creatinine greater than 133 mumol/L, left ventricular ejection fraction lower than 45%, chronic pulmonary disease, unstable angina, congestive heart failure, repeat CABG, anemia, and carotid atherosclerosis. Hospital mortality and morbidity were the primary end-points of the study. Results: Six patients (9%) crossed over from the original randomized group. Twenty-eight patients averaging 70+/-8 years of age underwent 3+/-1 grafts off pump, and 37 patients averaging 70+/-6 years of age underwent 3.4+/-1 grafts on pump. Revascularization was considered complete in 21 (75%) of off-pump patients compared to 33 (89%) of on-pump patients (P=.1). There were no hospital deaths in off-pump patients, and 2 patients (5%) undergoing on-pump CABG died early following surgery (P=.2). Two off-pump (7%) compared to 11 on-pump (30%) of patients presented composite end-points including death, neurological injury, renal failure, respiratory failure, and operative myocardial infarction after CABG (P=.02). Conclusion: The present study suggests that off-pump CABG, when technically feasible, significantly reduces morbidity following surgery in a group of high-risk patients.

J	White, NM; Holahan, MR; Goffaux, P				White, NM; Holahan, MR; Goffaux, P			Involuntary, unreinforced (pure) spatial learning is impaired by fimbria-fornix but not by dorsal hippocampus lesions	HIPPOCAMPUS			English	Article						hippocampus; fimbria-fornix; spatial learning; movement; reinforcement	CONDITIONED PLACE PREFERENCE; LIMBIC-STRIATAL INTERACTIONS; PATH INTEGRATION; LATENT INHIBITION; PARIETAL CORTEX; NUCLEUS-ACCUMBENS; MEMORY-SYSTEMS; AMYGDALA; RATS; NAVIGATION	Pure spatial learning occurs when rats acquire information about an environment while exploring it in the absence of reinforcers. We previously reported that voluntary, unreinforced exploration of a radial maze retards subsequent reinforced conditioned cue preference (CCP) learning in the same maze. In the present experiment, we examined the effects of involuntary, unreinforced pre-exposure to a radial maze. During pre-exposure, rats were moved by an experimenter between the ends of two arms of a radial maze five times in 30 min. This form of pre-exposure retarded CCP learning, whereas rats that were not pre-exposed and rats that were pre-exposed to a maze in a different room displayed normal CCP learning. These findings suggest that some information specific to the maze environment was acquired during involuntary unreinforced pre-exposure to it. In experiment 2, the retardation of reinforced CCP learning by involuntary unreinforced pre-exposure was eliminated by fimbria-fornix lesions made before pre-exposure but was unaffected by fimbria-fornix lesions made after pre-exposure but before training. Large neurotoxic lesions of the dorsal hippocampus made before pre-exposure had no effect on the retardation of CCP learning, but the rats with these lesions were impaired on a standard test of reinforced spatial learning in a water maze. The lesion effects in experiment 2 are similar to those previously reported for voluntary exploration and suggest that pure spatial learning may occur during both voluntary exploration of and involuntary exposure to an environment in the absence of reinforcers. Pure spatial learning can apparently occur with exposure to two different locations within an environment, but the rats do not have to move between the locations voluntarily. An intact fimbria-fornix is required for acquisition but not expression of this form of learning. The hippocampus is not involved in this form of learning. (C) 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

In slices from C57BL/6 mice, by means of GABA(B) receptors, gabapentin and baclofen activated outward K+ currents at resting membrane potential. In weaver mice with a Kir3.2 channel mutation, baclofen and gabapentin failed to activate postsynaptic K+ currents However, in littermate controls of weaver mice, gabapentin failed to evoke K+ currents, whereas baclofen activated currents in the same cells. Thus, postsynaptic actions of gabapentin and baclofen on K+ currents are different in this mouse strain. Via presynaptic GABA(B) receptors, baclofen significantly reduced GABA(B) inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) in slices from C57BL/6 mice, as well as weaver and control mice. In contrast, gabapentin did not affect IPSCs significantly in any group of mice. These results indicate that although baclofen and gabapentin are agonists at postsynaptic GABA(B) receptors positively coupled to K+ channels, their mechanism of action differs in certain strains of mice, including the weaver wild-type mice, suggesting a dissociation in their signaling mechanism and coupling to K+ channels.

Mechanisms of long-term depression (LTD) of synaptic transmission in this pathway may affect olfactory and mnemonic processing. We have investigated stimulation parameters for the induction of homosynaptic LTD and depotentiation in this pathway using evoked synaptic field potential recordings in the awake rat. In this study, 15 min of 1-Hz stimulation induced a transient (<5 min) depression of evoked responses but did not induce LTD or depotentiation. To determine whether inhibitory and/or facilitatory mechanisms contribute to LTD induction, repetitive delivery of pairs of stimulation pulses was also assessed. Repetitive paired-pulse stimulation with a 10-ms interval between pulses, which activates inhibitory mechanisms during the second response, did not reliably induce LTD. However, repetitive paired-pulse stimulation using a 30-ms interval, which evokes marked paired-pulse facilitation, resulted in synaptic depression that lasted greater than or equal to1 day, and which was reversible by tetanization. The selective induction of LTD by stimulation that evokes paired-pulse facilitation suggests that strong synaptic activation is required for LTD induction. The N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist MK-801 (0.1 mg/kg) blocked the induction of LTD, indicating that NMDA receptor activation is required for LTD induction in this pathway. These results indicate that LTD in piriform cortex inputs to the entorhinal cortex in the awake rat is effectively induced by strong repetitive synaptic stimulation, and that this form of LTD is dependent on activation of NMDA receptors.

The rats were allowed to explore a sample object for 5 min/day on 5 consecutive days, either 5 weeks or I week before surgery. After surgery, retrograde recognition was assessed by comparing the amount of time spent exploring the sample versus a novel object in a free-choice situation. Control rats spent more time exploring the novel object than the sample objects from both presurgery time periods, whereas rats with HPC lesions did not discriminate between the novel objects and sample objects from either presurgery time period. Despite their deficits on the retrograde recognition test, the rats with HPC lesions performed like control rats on anterograde recognition tests, displaying a strong exploratory preference for novel objects over sample objects, with retention delays of either 15 min or 24 h. The findings suggest that extrahippocampal circuitry is capable of supporting object recognition, but only if the HPC does not participate in encoding the original encounter with the object.

In this approach, patient electrophysiological data are standardized using a multiparameter coding system, annotated to their respective magnetic resonance images (MRIs), and nonlinearly registered to a high-resolution MRI reference brain. Once registered, we are able to demonstrate clustering of like interpatient physiologic responses within the thalamus, globus pallidus, subthalamic nucleus, and adjacent structures. These data may in turn be registered to a three-dimensional patient MRI within our image-guided visualization program enabling prior to surgery the delineation of surgical targets, anatomy with high probability of containing specific cell types, and functional borders. The functional data were obtained from 88 patients (106 procedures) via microelectrode recording and electrical stimulation performed during stereotactic neurosurgery at the London Health Sciences Centre. Advantages of this method include the use of nonlinear registration to accommodate for interpatient anatomical variability and the avoidance of digitized versions of printed atlases of anatomy as a common database coordinate system. The resulting database is expandable, easily searched using a graphical user interface, and provides a visual representation of functional organization within the deep brain.

J	Sahambi, HS; Khorasani, K				Sahambi, HS; Khorasani, K			A neural-network appearance-based 3-D object recognition using independent component analysis	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS			English	Article						appearance-based object recognition; blind source separation; independent component analysis (ICA); principle component analysis (PCA)	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; FACE RECOGNITION; BLIND SEPARATION; VISUAL FEEDBACK; REPRESENTATION	This paper presents results on appearance-based three-dimensional (3-D) object recognition (3DOR) accomplished by utilizing a neural-network architecture developed based on independent component analysis (ICA). ICA has already been applied for face recognition in the literature with encouraging results. In this paper, we are exploring the possibility of utilizing the redundant information in the visual data to enhance the view based object recognition. The underlying premise here is that since ICA uses high-order statistics; it should in principle outperform principle component analysis (PCA), which does not utilize statistics higher than two, in the recognition task. Two databases of images captured by a CCD camera are used.. It is demonstrated that ICA did perform better than PCA in one of the databases, but interestingly its performance was no better than PCA in the case of the second database. Thus, suggesting that the use of ICA may not necessarily always give better results than PCA, and that the application of ICA is highly data dependent. Various factors affecting the differences in the recognition performance using both methods are also discussed.

In this paper, we describe an alternative object-based strategy dedicated to the cortex. This strategy relies on an artificial neuroanatomist performing automatic recognition of the main cortical sulci and parcellation of the cortical surface into gyral patches. A set of shape descriptors, which can be compared across subjects, is then attached to the sulcus and gyrus related objects segmented by this process. The framework is used to perform a study of 142 brains of the ICBM database. This study reveals some correlates of handedness on the size of the sulci located in motor areas, which seem to be beyond the scope of the standard voxel based morphometry.

They must be heritable because there can be no selection for traits that are not. They must be quasi-independent from other heritable traits, since adaptive variations in a specific cognitive capacity could have no distinctive consequences for fitness if effecting those variations required widespread changes in other unrelated traits and capacities as well. These requirements would be satisfied by innate cognitive modules, as the dominant paradigm in evolutionary cognitive psychology assumes. However, those requirements would also be satisfied by heritable learning biases, perhaps in the form of architectural or chronotopic constraints, that operated to increase the canalization of specific cognitive capacities in the ancestral environment (Cummins and Cummins 1999). As an organism develops, cognitive capacities that are highly canalized as the result of heritable learning biases might result in an organism that is behaviourally quite similar to an organism whose innate modules come on line as the result of various environmental triggers. Taking this possibility seriously is increasingly important as the case against innate cognitive modules becomes increasingly strong.

Design Renal D-2-like receptor protein expression and distribution has not been studied in the SHR. Since changes in D-2-like receptor expression and/or distribution may contribute to the dysregulation of renal dopamine and D-1A receptor function, we examined the expression of the three subtypes of D-2-like receptors (D-2, D-3 and D-4) in SHR and WKY rat kidneys. Methods Western blot analysis and confocal immunocytochemistry with specific polyclonal antipeptide antibodies directed against the receptor subtypes, were used to assess protein expression. Results There were no differences in protein expression and cellular immunolocalization of the D-2 receptor subtypes between SHR and WKY rats. Expression of the 50 kDa D-3 receptor was reduced in the cortex of the SHR; no differences in D-3 receptor levels were seen in the inner medulla of SHR and WKY rats. The D-4 receptor polypeptides were overexpressed in the cortex of SHR, while in the inner medulla no difference in expression of the D-4 receptor proteins was observed between SHR and WKY rats. Immunocytochemistry also showed increased immunostaining of D-4 receptors in tubular structures in the cortex, but diminished staining in the SHR inner medulla. Conclusion The observed differences in expression and distribution of D-3 and D-4 dopamine receptors between cortex and inner medulla of the kidneys of SHR and WKY rats may contribute to the aberrant state of dopaminergic-mediated natriuresis in SHR.

Most often the sequelae of long-term dyslipoproteinaemia lead to atherosclerotic vascular disease in all arterial beds. Plasma elevation of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), very low-density lipoproteins ( VLDL) and lipoprotein( a), and reduced levels of high-density lipoproteins (HDL-C) are risk factors for coronary artery disease. Severe elevations of plasma triglycerides may lead to acute pancreatitis. In Western societies and in emerging economies, lifestyle contributes to the expression of lipoprotein disorders. Many dyslipoproteinaemias have a genetic aetiology. This review will examine the contribution of genetic lipoprotein disorders in human disease. Emphasis will be placed on monogenic disorders that are associated with coronary artery disease and novel causes of disorders of high-density lipoproteins. The consideration of screening and treatment of affected individuals, especially children, must take into account the severity of the phenotype, the long-term risk of developing vascular disease and available evidence of clinical benefit in a group of diseases that are mostly asymptomatic until manifestations of organ ischaemia in the heart, limbs or brain.

Light signals reach the SCN via a dedicated retinal pathway, the retinohypothalamic tract (RHT). One question that continues to elude scientists is whether the circadian system has its own dedicated photoreceptor or photoreceptors. It is well established that conventional photoreceptors, rods and cones, are not required for circadian photoreception, suggesting that the inner retinal layer might contribute to circadian photoreception. Melanopsin, a novel photo pigment expressed in retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), has been proposed recently as a candidate circadian photoreceptor. Melanopsin-containing RGCs are intrinsically photosensitive, form part of the RHT, and contain neurotransmitters known to play a critical role in the circadian response to light. Furthermore, melanopsin-containing RGCs do not depend on inputs from rods and cones to transmit light signals to the SCN. However, based on a review of the available information about melanopsin and on new data from our laboratory, we propose that melanopsin, in itself, is not necessary for circadian photoreception. In fact, it appears that of the known photoreceptor systems, none, in and of itself, is necessary for circadian photoreception. Instead, it appears that within the photoreceptive systems there is some degree of redundancy, each contributing in some way to photic entrainment.

In the present study, we investigated the biology of microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs), responsible for the formation and stabilization of microtubules, in SOD1(G37R) mice. Our results show that the protein levels of MAP2, MAP1A, tau 100 kDa and tau 68 kDa species decrease significantly as early as 5 months before onset of symptoms in the spinal cord of SOD1(G37R) mice, whereas decrease in levels of tau 52-55 kDa species is most often noted with the manifestation of the clinical symptoms. Interestingly, there was no change in the protein levels of MAPs in the brain of SOD1(G37R) mice, a CNS organ spared by the mutant SOD1 toxicity. Remarkably, as early as 5 months before disease onset, the binding affinities of MAP1A, MAP2 and tau isoforms to the cytoskeleton decreased in spinal cord of SOD1(G37R) mice. This change correlated with a hyperphosphorylation of the soluble tau 52-55 kDa species at epitopes recognized by the antibodies AT8 and PHF-1. Finally, a shift in the distribution of MAP2 from the cytosol to the membrane is detected in SOD1(G37R) mice at the same stage. Thus, alterations in the integrity of microtubules are early events of the neurodegenerative processes in SOD1(G37R) mice.

In this work, we purified endothelial cells from intracerebral and subcutaneous experimental gliomas as well as from normal brain in order to define some of the phenotypical differences between angiogenic and quiescent brain vasculature. We show that the multidrug resistance genes encoding drug efflux pumps at the brain endothelium are expressed differently in normal and tumoral vasculature. We also show that EGs from gliomas present increased activity of gelatinase B (MMP9), key enzyme in the angiogenic process. Importantly, we observe a different phenotype between ECs in the intracerebral and subcutaneous models. Our results provide molecular evidence of phenotypic distinction between tumoral and normal brain vasculature and indicate that the EC phenotype depends on interactions both with tumor cells and also with the microenvironment.

The discharge of nearly all cells varied significantly with both hand location and the direction of isometric force before and during force-ramp generation as well as during static force-hold. In addition, nearly all cells displayed changes in the variation of their activity with force direction at different hand locations. This change in relationship was often expressed in part as a change in the cell's directional tuning at different hand locations. Cell directional tuning tended to shift systematically with hand location even though the direction of static force output at the hand remained constant. These directional effects were less pronounced before the onset of force output than after force onset. Cells also often showed planar modulations of discharge level with hand location. Sixteen proximal arm muscles showed similar effects, reflecting how hand location-dependent biomechanical factors altered their task-related activity. These findings indicate that MI single-cell activity does not covary exclusively with the level and direction of net force output at the hand and provides further evidence that MI contributes to the transformation between extrinsic and intrinsic representations of motor output during isometric force production.

We have here investigated the role of endogenous brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its receptor trkB in the mechanism of action of antidepressant drugs. We found that trkB.T1-overexpressing transgenic mice, which show reduced trkB activation in brain, as well as heterozygous BDNF null (BDNF(+/-)) mice, were resistant to the effects of antidepressants in the forced swim test, indicating that normal trkB signaling is required for the behavioral effects typically produced by antidepressants. In contrast, neurotrophin-3(+/-) mice showed a normal behavioral response to antidepressants. Furthermore, acute as well as chronic antidepressant treatment induced autophosphorylation and activation of trkB in cerebral cortex, particularly in the prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortex and hippocampus. Tyrosines in the trkB autophosphorylation site were phosphorylated in response to antidepressants, but phosphorylation of the shc binding site was not observed. Nevertheless, phosphorylation of cAMP response element-binding protein was increased by antidepressants in the prefrontal cortex concomitantly with trkB phosphorylation and this response was reduced in trkB.T1-overexpressing mice. Our data suggest that antidepressants acutely increase trkB signaling in a BDNF-dependent manner in cerebral cortex and that this signaling is required for the behavioral effects typical of antidepressant drugs. Neurotrophin signaling increased by antidepressants may induce formation and stabilization of synaptic connectivity, which gradually leads to the clinical antidepressive effects and mood recovery.

Using a pruning algorithm for Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) which determines the functionality of individual taxa in terms of model performance, we pruned the Surface Water Acidification Project (SWAP) pH-diatom data-set until the predictive performance of the pruned set (as assessed by a jackknifing procedure) was statistically different from the initial full-set. Our results, based on the validation at each 5% data-set reduction, show that (i) 85% of the taxa can be removed without any effect on the pH model calibration performance, and (ii) that the complexity and the dimensionality reduction of the model by the removal of these non-essential or redundant taxa greatly improve the robustness of the calibration. A comparison between the commonly used "marginal" criteria for inclusion (species tolerance and Hill's N2) and our functionality criterion shows that the importance of each taxon in an ANN palaeolimnological model calibration does not appear to depend on these marginal characteristics.

J	Zhao, KS; Luo, GX; Zhao, GM; Schiller, PW; Szeto, HH				Zhao, KS; Luo, GX; Zhao, GM; Schiller, PW; Szeto, HH			Transcellular transport of a highly polar 3+net charge opioid tetrapeptide	JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY AND EXPERIMENTAL THERAPEUTICS			English	Article							BASOLATERAL PEPTIDE TRANSPORTER; INTESTINAL-CELL LINE; EXPRESSION CLONING; DRUG ABSORPTION; CACO-2; PERMEABILITY; MEMBRANE; RECOGNITION; MONOLAYERS; RECEPTOR	Oligopeptides are generally thought to have poor permeability across biological membranes. Recent studies, however, suggest significant distribution of [Dmt(1)]DALDA (Dmt-D-Arg-Phe-Lys-NH2; Dmt is 2', 6'-dimethyltyrosine), a 3+ net charge opioid peptide, to the brain and spinal cord after subcutaneous administration. Peptide transporters (PEPT1 and PEPT2) play a major role in the uptake of di- and tripeptides across cell membranes, but their ability to transport tetrapeptides is not clear. The purpose of this study was to determine whether [Dmt(1)]DALDA can translocate across Caco-2 cell monolayers and whether PEPT1 plays a role in the uptake process. Our results show that [H-3][ Dmt(1)]DALDA can readily translocate across Caco-2 cells, with a permeability coefficient estimated to be 1.24x10(-5) cm/s. When incubated with Caco-2 cells, [H-3][Dmt(1)]DALDA was detected in cell lysates by 5 min. The internalization of [Dmt(1)]DALDA was confirmed visually with a fluorescent [Dmt(1)]DALDA analog (H-Dmt-D-Arg-Phe-dnsDap-NH2; dnsDap is beta-dansyl-L-alpha, beta-diaminopropionic acid). The uptake of [H-3][Dmt(1)]DALDA was concentration-dependent but temperature- and pH-independent. Treatment with diethylpyrocarbonate (DEPC) inhibited [C-14] glycine-sarcosine uptake but increased [H-3] [Dmt(1)]DALDA uptake 34-fold. These findings suggest that PEPT1 is not involved in [Dmt(1)]DALDA internalization. [Dmt(1)]DALDA uptake was also observed in SH-SY5Y, human embryonic kidney 293, and CRFK cells, and was independent of whether the cells expressed opioid receptors. The efflux of [H-3][Dmt(1)]DALDA from Caco-2 cells was temperature-dependent and was inhibited by DEPC, but was not affected by verapamil, an inhibitor of P-glycoprotein. These data show transcellular translocation of a highly polar 3+ charge tetrapeptide and suggest that [Dmt(1)]DALDA may not only distribute across the blood-brain barrier but also it may even have reasonable oral absorption.

Nitric oxide (NO) is involved in neuronal transmission by adjusting neurotransmitter release in adults and in stabilizing synaptic connections in developing brains. NO synthesis was decreased by inhibiting nitric oxide synthase (NOS) with an acute microinjection of A-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME); whereas NO synthesis was augmented by an acute micro injection Of L-arginine (L-ARG). The study is focused on rhythmic activity by analyzing fast Fourier transform (FFT). Collicular responses were recorded in anesthetized rats, at post-natal days (PND) 13-19 and adults. This time window was chosen because it is centered on eye opening. NO down- and upregulation resulted in a dual effect depending on age and response-type. NO synthesis inhibition decreased the magnitude of oscillations in ON responses in the youngest animals (PND13-PND14), whereas oscillations of frequencies higher than 20 Hz in OFF responses were increased in all age groups of developing rats. In adults NO downregulation increased oscillations in ON responses and decreased oscillations in OFF responses. L-arginine application produced effects opposite to those seen with L-NAME. Our data together with results reported in the literature suggest that the temporal patterns of the evoked activity are NO-dependent. This Sculpting action of the evoked firing may play a role in the synchronization of action potentials in afferent axons which in turn contributes to synaptic stabilization. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.
