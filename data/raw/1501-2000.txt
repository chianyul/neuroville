J	Lahmiri, S				Lahmiri, Salim			Image characterization by fractal descriptors in variational mode decomposition domain: Application to brain magnetic resonance	PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Brain magnetic resonance image; Discrete wavelet transform; Empirical mode decomposition; Variational mode decomposition; Fractal descriptors; Support vector machine	DIGITAL IMAGES; CLASSIFICATION; SEGMENTATION; SPECTRUM; DIMENSION; ENTROPY	The main purpose of this work is to explore the usefulness of fractal descriptors estimated in multi-resolution domains to characterize biomedical digital image texture. In this regard, three multi-resolution techniques are considered: the well-known discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and the empirical mode decomposition (EMD), and; the newly introduced; variational mode decomposition mode (VMD). The original image is decomposed by the DWF, EMD, and VMD into different scales. Then, Fourier spectrum based fractal descriptors is estimated at specific scales and directions to characterize the image. The support vector machine (SVM) was used to perform supervised classification. The empirical study was applied to the problem of distinguishing between normal and abnormal brain magnetic resonance images (MRI) affected with Alzheimer disease (AD). Our results demonstrate that fractal descriptors estimated in VMD domain outperform those estimated in DWT and EMD domains; and also those directly estimated from the original image.

In these patients, plasma vitamin E concentration is significantly reduced due to defects of chylomicron secretion. Vitamin E in adipose tissue (AT) and red blood cells (RBC) have been proposed as potential relevant biomarkers of vitamin E status but no reference values in children are available. The objectives were (i) to establish age-reference intervals in healthy children for a-tocopherol in plasma, red blood cells (RBC) and adipose tissue (AT) and (ii) to determine the variations of alpha-tocopherol in patients with CMRD after oral treatment with vitamin E. Methods: This prospective study included 166 healthy children (1 month - 18 years) and 4 patients with CMRD. Blood and AT were collected in healthy children during a scheduled surgery and in patients before and after a 4-month treatment with a-tocopherol acetate. Results: The reference ranges for a-tocopherol were 11.9 - 30 mu mol/L in plasma, 2.0 - 7.8 mu mol/L packed cells in RBC and 60 - 573 nmol/g in AT. alpha-tocopherol levels in plasma correlated with those of RBC (r = 0.31; p < 0.01). In patients with CMRD after 4 months treatment, a-tocopherol concentrations remained less than 70 % of the control values in plasma, increased by 180 % to reach normal values in RBC, and remained stable in the normal range in AT. Conclusion: This study establishes pediatric reference intervals for alpha-tocopherol in plasma, RBC and AT. These values will be beneficial in assessing accurate alpha-tocopherol status in children and to optimize the monitoring of rare diseases such as CMRD. Our data suggest that RBC alpha-tocopherol, appears as a relevant biomarker to appreciate the effectiveness of treatment with alpha-tocopherol in patients with a rare primary hypocholesterolemia. The biopsy of AT could be used at diagnosis to assess the severity of the vitamin E deficiency and periodically after a long duration of vitamin E therapy to assess whether the treatment is effective, based on reference intervals defined in this study.

MGTX Study Grp	Randomized Trial of Thymectomy in Myasthenia Gravis	NEW ENGLAND JOURNAL OF MEDICINE			English	Article							EXTENDED THYMECTOMY; THORACOSCOPIC THYMECTOMY; MYCOPHENOLATE-MOFETIL; FOLLOW-UP; PREDNISONE; STANDARDS; SCORE	BACKGROUND Thymectomy has been a mainstay in the treatment of myasthenia gravis, but there is no conclusive evidence of its benefit. We conducted a multicenter, randomized trial comparing thymectomy plus prednisone with prednisone alone. METHODS We compared extended transsternal thymectomy plus alternate-day prednisone with alternate-day prednisone alone. Patients 18 to 65 years of age who had generalized nonthymomatous myasthenia gravis with a disease duration of less than 5 years were included if they had Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America clinical class II to IV disease (on a scale from I to V, with higher classes indicating more severe disease) and elevated circulating concentrations of acetylcholine-receptor antibody. The primary outcomes were the time-weighted average Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis score (on a scale from 0 to 39, with higher scores indicating more severe disease) over a 3-year period, as assessed by means of blinded rating, and the time-weighted average required dose of prednisone over a 3-year period. RESULTS A total of 126 patients underwent randomization between 2006 and 2012 at 36 sites. Patients who underwent thymectomy had a lower time-weighted average Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis score over a 3-year period than those who received prednisone alone (6.15 vs. 8.99, P < 0.001); patients in the thymectomy group also had a lower average requirement for alternate-day prednisone (44 mg vs. 60 mg, P < 0.001). Fewer patients in the thymectomy group than in the prednisone-only group required immunosuppression with azathioprine (17% vs. 48%, P < 0.001) or were hospitalized for exacerbations (9% vs. 37%, P < 0.001). The number of patients with treatment-associated complications did not differ significantly between groups (P = 0.73), but patients in the thymectomy group had fewer treatment-associated symptoms related to immunosuppressive medications (P < 0.001) and lower distress levels related to symptoms (P = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS Thymectomy improved clinical outcomes over a 3-year period in patients with nonthymomatous myasthenia gravis.

We and others previously reported gene expression dysregulation, both as increases and decreases, of Synapsins in mood disorders, but little is known about the regulatory mechanisms leading to these differences. Thus, we proposed to study DNA methylation at theses genes' promoter regions, under the assumption that altered epigenetic marks at key regulatory sites would be the cause of gene expression changes and thus part of the mood disorder etiology. Methods: We performed CpG methylation mapping focusing on the three genes' predicted CpG islands using the Sequenom EpiTYPER platform. DNA extracted from post-mortem brain tissue (BA10) from individuals who had lived with bipolar disorder (BD), major depressive disorder (MDD), as well as psychiatrically healthy individuals was used. Differences in methylation across all CpGs within a CpG island and between the three diagnostic groups were assessed by 2-way mixed model analyses of variance. Results: We found no significant results for SYN1 or SYN3, but there was a significant group difference in SYN2 methylation, as well as an overall pattern of hypomethylation across the CpG island. Furthermore, we found a significant inverse correlation of DNA methylation with SYN2a mRNA expression. Conclusions: These findings contribute to previous work showing dysregulation of Synapsins, particularly SYN2, in mood disorders and improve our understanding of the regulatory mechanisms that precipitate these changes likely leading to the BD or MDD phenotype.

The Effect of a New Therapy for Children with Tics Targeting Underlying Cognitive, Behavioral, and Physiological Processes	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						Tourette disorder; tics; children; treatment; cognitive-behavioral therapy; psychophysiological	QUALITY-OF-LIFE; LA-TOURETTES-SYNDROME; HABIT-REVERSAL; RESPONSE PREVENTION; PEER VICTIMIZATION; YOUNG-PEOPLE; DISORDERS; YOUTH; TRIAL; INTERVENTIONS	Tourette disorder (TD) is characterized by motor and vocal tics, and children with TD tend to present a lower quality of life than neurotypical children. This study applied a manualized treatment for childhood tics disorder, Facotik, to a consecutive case series of children aged 8-12 years. The Facotik therapy was adapted from the adult cognitive and psychophysiological program validated on a range of subtypes of tics. This approach aims to modify the cognitive-behavioral and physiological processes against which the tic occurs, rather than only addressing the tic behavior. The Facotik therapy lasted 12-14 weeks. Each week 90-min session contained 20 min of parental training. The therapy for children followed 10 stages including: awareness training; improving motor control; modifying style of planning; cognitive and behavioral restructuring; and relapse prevention. Thirteen children were recruited as consecutive referrals from the general population, and seven cases completed therapy and posttreatment measures. Overall results showed a significant decrease in symptom severity as measured by the YGTSS and the TSGS. However, there was a discrepancy between parent and child rating, with some children perceiving an increase in tics, possibly due to improvement of awareness along therapy. They were also individual changes on adaptive aspects of behavior as measured with the BASC-2, and there was variability among children. All children maintained or improved self-esteem posttreatment. The results confirm the conclusion of a previous pilot study, which contributed to the adaptation of the adult therapy. In summary, the Facotik therapy reduced tics in children. These results underline that addressing processes underlying tics may complement approaches that target tics specifically.

MINC 2.0: A Flexible Format for Multi-Modal Images	Frontiers in Neuroinformatics			English	Article						neuroimaging; provenance; metadata; data management; data format; HDF5	SYSTEM; BRAIN	It is often useful that an imaging data format can afford rich metadata, be flexible, scale to very large file sizes, support multi-modal data, and have strong inbuilt mechanisms for data provenance. Beginning in 1992, MINC was developed as a system for flexible, self-documenting representation of neuroscientific imaging data with arbitrary orientation and dimensionality. The MINC system incorporates three broad components: a file format specification, a programming library, and a growing set of tools. In the early 2000's the MINC developers created MINC 2.0, which added support for 64-bit file sizes, internal compression, and a number of other modern features. Because of its extensible design, it has been easy to incorporate details of provenance in the header metadata, including an explicit processing history, unique identifiers, and vendor-specific scanner settings. This makes MINC ideal for use in large scale imaging studies and databases. It also makes it easy to adapt to new scanning sequences and modalities.

Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) isamongthe key regulators that shape brain plasticity. However, advancing age and carrying the BDNF Met allele were both identified as factors that potentially reduce BDNF secretion, brain plasticity, and memory. Here, we investigated the moderating role of BDNF polymorphism on sleep and next-morning learning ability in 107 nondemented individuals who were between 55 and 84 years of age. All subjects were tested with 1 night of in-laboratory polysomnography followed by a cognitive evaluation the next morning. We found that in subjects carrying the BDNF Val66Val polymorphism, consolidated sleep was associated with significantly better performance on hippocampus-dependent episodic memory tasks the next morning (beta-values from 0.290 to 0.434, p <= 0.01). In subjects carrying at least one copy of the BDNF Met allele, a more consolidated sleep was not associated with better memory performance in most memory tests (beta-values from -0.309 to -0.392, p values from 0.06 to 0.15). Strikingly, increased sleep consolidation was associated with poorer performance in learning a short story presented verbally in Met allele carriers (beta = -0.585, p = 0.005). This study provides new evidence regarding the interacting roles of consolidated sleep and BDNF polymorphism in the ability to learn and stresses the importance of considering BDNF polymorphism when studying how sleep affects cognition.

Method: 14 patients who received WBRT were imaged using dynamic contrast enhanced DCE-MRI prior to and at 8-weeks, 16-weeks and 24-weeks after the initiation of WBRT. Twelve of the patients were also enrolled in the RTOG 0614 trial, which randomized patients to the use of placebo or memantine. After the unblinding of the treatments received by RTOG 0614 patients, DCE-MRI measures of tumor tissue and normal appearing white matter (NAWM) vascular permeability (Initial Area Under the Curve (AUC) Blood Adjusted) was analyzed. Cognitive, quality-of-life (QOL) assessment and blood samples were collected according to the patient's ability to tolerate the exams. Circulating endothelial cells (CEC) were measured using flow cytometry. Results: Following WBRT, there was an increasing trend in the vascular permeability of tumors (p=0.09) and NAWM (p=0.06) with time. Memantine significantly (p=0.01) reduced NAWM AUC changes following radiotherapy. Patients on memantine retained (COWA p=0.03) better cognitive functions than those on placebo. No association was observed between the level of CEC and DCE-MRI changes, time from radiotherapy or memantine use. Conclusions: DCE-MRI can detect vascular damage secondary to WBRT. Our data suggests that memantine reduces WBRT-induced brain vasculature damages.

ANCL Gene Discovery Consortium	Diagnosis and misdiagnosis of adult neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (Kufs disease)	NEUROLOGY			English	Article							DOMINANT INHERITANCE; MUTATIONS; CLN6; NCL; DEFICIENCY; PHENOTYPES; EPILEPSY; JUVENILE; SPECTRUM; DNAJC5	Objective: To critically re-evaluate cases diagnosed as adult neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (ANCL) in order to aid clinicopathologic diagnosis as a route to further gene discovery. Methods: Through establishment of an international consortium we pooled 47 unsolved cases regarded by referring centers as ANCL. Clinical and neuropathologic experts within the Consortium established diagnostic criteria for ANCL based on the literature to assess each case. A panel of 3 neuropathologists independently reviewed source pathologic data. Cases were given a final clinicopathologic classification of definite ANCL, probable ANCL, possible ANCL, or not ANCL. Results: Of the 47 cases, only 16 fulfilled the Consortium's criteria of ANCL (5 definite, 2 probable, 9 possible). Definitive alternate diagnoses were made in 10, including Huntington disease, early-onset Alzheimer disease, Niemann-Pick disease, neuroserpinopathy, prion disease, and neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation. Six cases had features suggesting an alternate diagnosis, but no specific condition was identified; in 15, the data were inadequate for classification. Misinterpretation of normal lipofuscin as abnormal storage material was the commonest cause of misdiagnosis. Conclusions: Diagnosis of ANCL remains challenging; expert pathologic analysis and recent molecular genetic advances revealed misdiagnoses in >1/3 of cases. We now have a refined group of cases that will facilitate identification of new causative genes.

Endocannabinoid signaling enhances visual responses through modulation of intracellular chloride levels in retinal ganglion cells	ELIFE			English	Article							K-CL COTRANSPORTER; CB1 CANNABINOID RECEPTOR; SOMATOSENSORY CORTEX; OLFACTORY EPITHELIUM; DEPENDENT PLASTICITY; SYNAPTIC PLASTICITY; CONTRAST ADAPTATION; NERVOUS-SYSTEM; XENOPUS-LAEVIS; NIGHT-VISION	Type 1 cannabinoid receptors (CB1Rs) are widely expressed in the vertebrate retina but the role of endocannabinoids in vision is not fully understood. Here we identified a novel mechanism underlying a CB1R-mediated increase in retinal ganglion cell (RGC) intrinsic excitability acting through AMPK-dependent inhibition of NKCC1 activity. Clomeleon imaging and patch clamp recordings revealed that inhibition of NKCC1 downstream of CB1R activation reduces intracellular Cl- levels in RGCs, hyperpolarizing the resting membrane potential. We confirmed that such hyperpolarization enhances RGC action potential firing in response to subsequent depolarization, consistent with the increased intrinsic excitability of RGCs observed with CB1R activation. Using a dot avoidance assay in freely swimming Xenopus tadpoles we demonstrate that CB1R activation markedly improves visual contrast sensitivity under low light conditions. These results highlight a role for endocannabinoids in vision, and present a novel mechanism for cannabinoid modulation of neuronal activity through Cl- regulation.	[Miraucourt, L.

Amyloidosis due to the accumulation of amyloid-beta (A beta) was initially regarded as a specific and exclusive characteristic of neurodegenerative alterations seen in the brain of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. More recently, it was discovered that amyloidosis-related alterations, similar to those seen in the brain of Alzheimer's patients, also occur in the retina. Remarkably, these alterations were identified not only in primary retinal pathologies, such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and glaucoma, but also in the retinas of Alzheimer's patients. In this review, we first briefly discuss the biogenesis of A beta, a peptide involved in amyloidosis. We then discuss some pathological aspects (synaptic dysfunction, mitochondrial failure, glial activation, and vascular abnormalities) related to the neurotoxic effects of A beta. We finally highlight common features shared by AD, AMD, and glaucoma in the context of A beta amyloidosis and further discuss why the retina, due to the transparency of the eye, can be considered as a "window" to the brain.

Immunoablation and autologous haemopoietic stem-cell transplantation for aggressive multiple sclerosis: a multicentre single-group phase 2 trial	LANCET			English	Article							DOSE IMMUNOSUPPRESSIVE THERAPY; BONE-MARROW TRANSPLANTATION; CONDITIONING REGIMEN; INTERNATIONAL BLOOD; AUTOIMMUNE-DISEASES; EUROPEAN GROUP; BRAIN ATROPHY; DISABILITY; EXPERIENCE; OUTCOMES	Background Strong immunosuppression, including chemotherapy and immune-depleting antibodies followed by autologous haemopoietic stem-cell transplantation (aHSCT), has been used to treat patients with multiple sclerosis, improving control of relapsing disease. We addressed whether near-complete immunoablation followed by immune cell depleted aHSCT would result in long-term control of multiple sclerosis. Methods We did this phase 2 single-arm trial at three hospitals in Canada. We enrolled patients with multiple sclerosis, aged 18-50 years with poor prognosis, ongoing disease activity, and an Expanded Disability Status Scale of 3.0-6.0. Autologous CD34 selected haemopoietic stem-cell grafts were collected after mobilisation with cyclophosphamide and filgrastim. Immunoablation with busulfan, cyclophosphamide, and rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin was followed by aHSCT. The primary outcome was multiple sclerosis activity-free survival (events were clinical relapse, appearance of a new or Gd-enhancing lesion on MRI, and sustained progression of Expanded Disability Status Scale score). This study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01099930. Findings Between diagnosis and aHSCT, 24 patients had 167 clinical relapses over 140 patient-years with 188 Gd-enhancing lesions on 48 pre-aHSCT MRI scans. Median follow-up was 6.7 years (range 3.9-12.7). The primary outcome, multiple sclerosis activity-free survival at 3 years after transplantation was 69.6% (95% CI 46.6-84.2). With up to 13 years of follow-up after aHSCT, no relapses occurred and no Gd enhancing lesions or new T2 lesions were seen on 314 MRI sequential scans. The rate of brain atrophy decreased to that expected for healthy controls. One of 24 patients died of transplantation-related complications. 35% of patients had a sustained improvement in their Expanded Disability Status Scale score.

Differential Expression of FosB Proteins and Potential Target Genes in Select Brain Regions of Addiction and Depression Patients	PLOS ONE			English	Article							CHRONIC ELECTROCONVULSIVE SEIZURES; DELTA-FOSB; NUCLEUS-ACCUMBENS; CHRONIC COCAINE; EPIGENETIC MECHANISMS; CHRONIC STRESS; INDUCTION; CDK5; STABILITY; PHOSPHORYLATION	Chronic exposure to stress or drugs of abuse has been linked to altered gene expression throughout the body, and changes in gene expression in discrete brain regions are thought to underlie many psychiatric diseases, including major depressive disorder and drug addiction. Preclinical models of these disorders have provided evidence for mechanisms of this altered gene expression, including transcription factors, but evidence supporting a role for these factors in human patients has been slow to emerge. The transcription factor.FosB is induced in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus (HPC) of rodents in response to stress or cocaine, and its expression in these regions is thought to regulate their "top down" control of reward circuitry, including the nucleus accumbens (NAc). Here, we use biochemistry to examine the expression of the FosB family of transcription factors and their potential gene targets in PFC and HPC postmortem samples from depressed patients and cocaine addicts. We demonstrate that Delta FosB and other FosB isoforms are downregulated in the HPC but not the PFC in the brains of both depressed and addicted individuals. Further, we show that potential Delta FosB transcriptional targets, including GluA2, are also downregulated in the HPC but not PFC of cocaine addicts. Thus, we provide the first evidence of FosB gene expression in human HPC and PFC in these psychiatric disorders, and in light of recent findings demonstrating the critical role of HPC Delta FosB in rodent models of learning and memory, these data suggest that reduced Delta FosB in HPC could potentially underlie cognitive deficits accompanying chronic cocaine abuse or depression.

Multiple Running Speed Signals in Medial Entorhinal Cortex	NEURON			English	Article							FREELY-MOVING RATS; HIPPOCAMPAL THETA-RHYTHM; OSCILLATORY INTERFERENCE; HEAD DIRECTION; GRID CELLS; PATH-INTEGRATION; BEHAVIORAL STATE; NEURON ACTIVITY; SEPTUM; MODEL	Grid cells in medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) can be modeled using oscillatory interference or attractor dynamic mechanisms that perform path integration, a computation requiring information about running direction and speed. The two classes of computational models often use either an oscillatory frequency or a firing rate that increases as a function of running speed. Yet it is currently not known whether these are two manifestations of the same speed signal or dissociable signals with potentially different anatomical substrates. We examined coding of running speed in MEC and identified these two speed signals to be independent of each other within individual neurons. The medial septum (MS) is strongly linked to locomotor behavior, and removal of MS input resulted in strengthening of the firing rate speed signal, while decreasing the strength of the oscillatory speed signal. Thus, two speed signals are present in MEC that are differentially affected by disrupted MS input.	[Hinman, James R.; Brandon, Mark P.; Climer, Jason R.; Chapman, G.

Phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) is one of the important forms of this interaction where the amplitude of higher frequency oscillations is modulated by the phase of lower frequency activity. Here, we studied the dynamic variations of PAC of high (gamma and ripple) and low (delta, theta, alpha, and beta) frequency bands in patients with focal epilepsy in different sleep stages during the interictal period, in an attempt to see if coupling is different in more or less epileptogenic regions. Sharp activities were excluded to avoid their effect on the PAC. The results revealed that the coupling intensity was generally the highest in stage N3 of sleep and the lowest in rapid eye movement sleep. We also compared the coupling strength in different regions [seizure onset zone (SOZ), exclusively irritative zone, and normal zone]. PAC between high and low frequency rhythms was found to be significantly stronger in the SOZ compared to normal regions. Also, the coupling was generally more elevated in spiking channels outside the SOZ than in normal regions. We also examined how the power in the delta band correlates to the PAC, and found a mild but statistically significant correlation between slower background activity in epileptic channels and the elevated coupling in these channels. The results suggest that an elevated PAC may reflect some fundamental abnormality, even after exclusion of sharp activities and even in the interictal period. PAC may therefore contribute to understanding the underlying dynamics of epileptogenic brain regions.

Burst Firing in the Electrosensory System of Gymnotiform Weakly Electric Fish: Mechanisms and Functional Roles	FRONTIERS IN COMPUTATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Review						burst firing; weakly electric fish; feature detection; directional selectivity; neural coding; envelope	LATERAL-LINE LOBE; INTERSPIKE INTERVAL CORRELATIONS; P-TYPE ELECTRORECEPTORS; AFFERENT NERVE-FIBERS; SHORT-TERM DEPRESSION; PRIMARY VISUAL-CORTEX; COMMUNICATION SIGNALS; PYRAMIDAL NEURONS; SENSORY NEURONS; GAIN-CONTROL	Neurons across sensory systems and organisms often display complex patterns of action potentials in response to sensory input. One example of such a pattern is the tendency of neurons to fire packets of action potentials (i.e., a burst) followed by quiescence. While it is well known that multiple mechanisms can generate bursts of action potentials at both the single-neuron and the network level, the functional role of burst firing in sensory processing is not so well understood to date. Here we provide a comprehensive review of the known mechanisms and functions of burst firing in processing of electrosensory stimuli in gymnotiform weakly electric fish. We also present new evidence from existing data showing that bursts and isolated spikes provide distinct information about stimulus variance. It is likely that these functional roles will be generally applicable to other systems and species.

FLIM FRET Visualization of Cdc42 Activation by Netrin-1 in Embryonic Spinal Commissural Neuron Growth Cones	PLOS ONE			English	Article							AMYLOID PRECURSOR PROTEIN; SNARE-MEDIATED EXOCYTOSIS; COLORECTAL-CANCER; PLASMA-MEMBRANE; AXON OUTGROWTH; CORTICAL-NEURONS; RHO GTPASES; CELL INVASIVENESS; LIVING CELLS; RECRUITS DCC	Netrin-1 is an essential extracellular chemoattractant that signals through its receptor DCC to guide commissural axon extension in the embryonic spinal cord. DCC directs the organization of F-actin in growth cones by activating an intracellular protein complex that includes the Rho GTPase Cdc42, a critical regulator of cell polarity and directional migration. To address the spatial distribution of signaling events downstream of netrin-1, we expressed the FRET biosensor Raichu-Cdc42 in cultured embryonic rat spinal commissural neurons. Using FLIM-FRET imaging we detected rapid activation of Cdc42 in neuronal growth cones following application of netrin-1. Investigating the signaling mechanisms that control Cdc42 activation by netrin-1, we demonstrate that netrin-1 rapidly enriches DCC at the leading edge of commissural neuron growth cones and that netrin-1 induced activation of Cdc42 in the growth cone is blocked by inhibiting src family kinase signaling. These findings reveal the activation of Cdc42 in embryonic spinal commissural axon growth cones and support the conclusion that src family kinase activation downstream of DCC is required for Cdc42 activation by netrin-1.

The present study was designed to assess the neural substrate associated with a haptic 2D angle discrimination task in both sighted and blind individuals. Subjects performed tactile angle size discriminations in order to investigate whether the pattern of crossmodal occipital recruitment was lateralized as a function of the stimulated hand. Task-elicited activations were also compared across different difficulty levels to ascertain the potential modulatory role of task difficulty on crossmodal processing within occipital areas. We show that blind subjects had more widespread activation within the right lateral and superior occipital gyri when performing the haptic discrimination task. In contrast, the sighted activated the left cuneus and lingual gyrus more so than the blind when performing the task. Furthermore, activity within visual areas was shown to be predictive of tactile discrimination thresholds in the blind, but not in the sighted. Activity within parietal and occipital areas was modulated by task difficulty, where the easier angle comparison elicited more focal occipital activity along with bilateral posterior parietal activity, whereas the more difficult comparison produced more widespread occipital activity combined with reduced parietal activation. Finally, we show that crossmodal reorganization within the occipital cortex of blind individuals was primarily right lateralized, regardless of the stimulated hand, supporting previous evidence for a right-sided hemispheric specialization of the occipital cortex of blind individuals for the processing of tactile and haptic inputs.

It is well established that synapse loss and ensuing neurodegeneration are the best predictors for memory impairments in AD. Latest studies have emphasized the neurotoxic role of soluble amyloid-beta oligomers (A beta o) that begin to accumulate in the human brain approximately 10 to 15 yr before the clinical symptoms become apparent. Many reports indicate that soluble A beta o correlate with memory deficits in AD models and humans. The A beta o-induced neurodegeneration observed in neuronal and brain slice cultures has been more challenging to reproduce in many animal models. The model of repeated A beta o infusions shown here overcome this issue and allow addressing two key domains for developing new disease modifying therapies: identify biological markers to diagnose early AD, and determine the molecular mechanisms underpinning A beta o-induced memory deficits at the onset of AD. Since soluble A beta o aggregate relatively fast into insoluble A beta fibrils that correlate poorly with the clinical state of patients, soluble A beta o are prepared freshly and injected once per day during six days to produce marked cell death in the hippocampus. We used cannula specially design for simultaneous infusions of A beta o and continuous infusion of A beta o antibody (6E10) in the hippocampus using osmotic pumps. This innovative in vivo method can now be used in preclinical studies to validate the efficiency of new AD therapies that might prevent the deposition and neurotoxicity of A beta o in pre-dementia patients.

Over the past few decades, the interest in differences between male and female patients has expanded to encompass brain morphology and neurocognitive function. Despite some variability and methodological shortcomings, a few patterns emerge from the available literature. Most studies of gross neuroanatomy show more enlarged ventricles and smaller frontal lobes in men than in women with schizophrenia; finding reflecting normal sexual dimorphism. In comparison, studies of brain asymmetry and specific corticolimbic structures, suggest a disturbance in normal sexual dimorphism. The neurocognitive findings are somewhat consistent with this picture. Studies of cognitive functions mediated by the lateral frontal network tend to show sex differences in patients which are in the same direction as those observed in the general population, whereas studies of processes mediated by the corticolimbic system more frequently reveal reversal of normal sexual dimorphisms. These trends are faint and future research would need to delineate neurocognitive differences between men and women with various subtypes of schizophrenia (e.g., early versus late onset), while taking into consideration hormonal status and gender of tested participants.

Leaks also cause unreliable monitoring of respiratory drive and respiratory rate. Furthermore, ventilator adjustment must take into account that infants have strong vagal reflexes, demonstrate central apnea and periodic breathing, with a high variability in breathing pattern. Neurally-adjusted ventilatory assist (NAVA) is a mode of ventilation whereby the timing and amount of ventilatory assist is controlled by the patient's neural respiratory drive. Since NAVA uses the diaphragm electrical activity (Edi) as the controller signal, it is possible to deliver synchronized assist, both invasively and non-invasively (NIV-NAVA), to follow the variability in breathing pattern, and to monitor patient respiratory drive, independent of leaks. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: This article provides a review of the scientific literature pertaining to the use of NAVA in children (neonatal and pediatric age groups). Both the invasive and non-invasive NAVA publications are summarized, as well as the use of Edi monitoring. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Overall, the use of NAVA and Edi monitoring is feasible and safe. Compared to conventional ventilation, NAVA improves patient-ventilator interaction, and provides lower peak inspiratory pressure. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence from a few trials suggests improved comfort, less sedation, and reduced length of stay.

J	Potvin, S; Marchand, S				Potvin, Stephane; Marchand, Serge			Pain facilitation and pain inhibition during conditioned pain modulation in fibromyalgia and in healthy controls	PAIN			English	Article						Fibromyalgia; Pain facilitation; Hyperalgesia; Pain inhibition; Thermal pain; Conditioned pain modulation; Diffuse noxious inhibitory control	MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER; CHRONIC WIDESPREAD PAIN; SPATIAL SUMMATION; IMPACT QUESTIONNAIRE; DIAGNOSTIC-CRITERIA; CONVERGENT NEURONS; MECHANISMS; SUBGROUPS; DEFICIT; HUMANS	Although fibromyalgia (FM) is associated with a deficit in inhibitory conditioned painmodulation (CPM), the discriminative power of CPM procedures is unknown. Moreover, the high intersubject heterogeneity in CPM responses in FM raises the possibility that a sizeable subgroup of these patients may experience pain facilitation during CPM, but the phenomenon has not been explicitly studied. To address these issues, 96 patients with FM and 71 healthy controls were recruited. Thermal stimuli were used to measure pain thresholds. Pain inhibition was elicited using a tonic thermal test (Peltier thermode) administered before and after activation of CPM mechanisms using a cold pressor test. Thermal pain thresholds were lower in patients with FM than in healthy controls. Pain ratings during the cold pressor test were higher in patients with FM, relative to controls. The CPM inhibitory efficacy was lower in patients with FM than in controls. The CPM procedure had good specificity (78.9%) but low sensitivity (45.7%), whereas a composite pain index had good sensitivity (75.0%) and specificity (78.9%). Finally, the rate of patients with FM who reported pain facilitation during the CPM procedure was found to be significantly increased compared with that of controls (41.7% vs 21.2%). The good discriminative power of the composite pain index highlights the need for further validation studies using mechanistically relevant psychophysical procedures in FM. The low sensitivity of the CPM procedure, combined with the large proportion of patients with FM experiencing pain facilitation during CPM, strongly suggests that endogenous pain inhibition mechanisms are deeply impaired in patients with FM, but only in a subgroup of them.

In this study, we combined functional magnetic resonance imaging with in-scanner video recording during thermal pain stimulations and use multilevel mediation analyses to study the brain mediators of pain facial expressions and the perception of pain intensity (self-reports) in healthy individuals and patients with chronic back pain (CBP). Behavioral data showed that the relation between pain expression and pain report was disrupted in CBP. In both patients with CBP and healthy controls, brain activity varying on a trial-by-trial basis with pain facial expressions was mainly located in the primary motor cortex and completely dissociated from the pattern of brain activity varying with pain intensity ratings. Stronger activity was observed in CBP specifically during pain facial expressions in several nonmotor brain regions such as the medial prefrontal cortex, the precuneus, and the medial temporal lobe. In sharp contrast, no moderating effect of chronic pain was observed on brain activity associated with pain intensity ratings. Our results demonstrate that pain facial expressions and pain intensity ratings reflect different aspects of pain processing and support psychosocial models of pain suggesting that distinctive mechanisms are involved in the regulation of pain behaviors in chronic pain.

Multiple aspects of a child's development are hindered, in both home and school settings, with negative impacts on social, emotional, and cognitive functioning. If left untreated, ADHD is commonly associated with poor academic achievement and low occupational status, as well as increased risk of substance abuse and delinquency. The objective of this study was to evaluate adult ADHD subject reported outcomes when switched from a stable dose of CONCERTA (R) to the same dose of generic Novo-methylphenidate ER-C (R). Methods: Randomized, double-blind, cross-over, phase IV trial consisted of two phases in which participants with a primary diagnosis of ADHD were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to 3 weeks of treatment with CONCERTA or generic Novo-Methylphenidate ER-C. Following 3 weeks of treatment, participants were crossed-over to receive the other treatment for an additional 3 weeks. Primary efficacy was assessed through the use of the Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication, Version II (TSQM-II). Results: Participants with ADHD treated with CONCERTA were more satisfied in terms of efficacy and side effects compared to those receiving an equivalent dose of generic Novo-Methylphenidate ER-C. All participants chose to continue with CONCERTA treatment at the conclusion of the study. Conclusion: Although CONCERTA and generic Novo-Methylphenidate ER-C have been deemed bioequivalent, however the present findings demonstrate clinically and statistically significant differences between generic and branded CONCERTA. Further investigation of these differences is warranted.

ObjectiveSurgery and cement augmentation procedures are effective palliative treatment of symptomatic spinal metastases. Our objective is to systematically review the literature to describe the survival, prognostic factors, and clinical outcomes of surgery and cement augmentation procedures for breast cancer metastases to the spine. MethodsWe performed a literature review using PubMed to identify articles that reported outcomes and/or prognostic factors of the breast cancer patient population with spinal metastases treated with any surgical technique since 1990. ResultsThe median postoperative survival for metastatic breast cancer was 21.7 months (8.2 to 36 months), the mean rate of any pain improvement was 92.9% (76 to 100%), the mean rate of neurologic improvement was 63.8% (53 to 100%), the mean rate of neurologic decline was 4.1% (0 to 8%), and the local tumor control rate was 92.6% (89 to 100%). Kyphoplasty studies reported a high rate of pain control in selected patients. Negative prognostic variables included hormonal (estrogen and progesterone) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) receptor refractory tumor status, high degree of axillary lymph node involvement, and short disease-free interval (DFI). All other clinical or prognostic parameters were of low or insufficient strength. ConclusionWith respect to clinical outcomes, surgery consistently yielded neurologic improvements in patients presenting with a deficit with a minimal risk of worsening; however, negative prognostic factors associated with shorter survival following surgery include estrogen receptor/progesterone receptor negativity, HER2 negativity, and a short DFI.

J	Parvizsedghy, L; Zayed, T				Parvizsedghy, Laya; Zayed, Tarek			Consequence of Failure: Neurofuzzy-Based Prediction Model for Gas Pipelines	JOURNAL OF PERFORMANCE OF CONSTRUCTED FACILITIES			English	Article						Oil and gas; Pipelines; Neurofuzzy; Consequences of failure; Forecast	COST CONSEQUENCES; NETWORK; CONSTRUCTION	Overall performance of energy infrastructure in the United States has been assessed as D+. More than 65% of America's energy is transported through the oil and gas pipelines, which have experienced more than 10,000 failures during the last three decades. There is a critical need for a failure prediction tool that can forecast the consequences of the hazardous failures. Failure of gas pipelines has become the subject of interest for some studies in the past. Previous studies mainly focused on physical models that need inspection data or developed subjective models. This paper aims at developing a model to forecast the consequences of the potential failures of such pipes using the historical data of the U.S. gas pipes network. The model applies a neurofuzzy technique in order to recognize the existing pattern among the input and output variables. It estimates the financial consequences of various failure scenarios for specific pipes in terms of size and specified minimum yield strength. For this purpose, a bowtie model is developed, and all possible scenarios of failure are identified. Various combinations of the identified factors and different number and types of membership functions, are applied in order to optimize the model's efficiency. The developed model is validated with an approximate accuracy of 80%. This study assists practitioners and academics who are working on the risk assessment of gas pipelines to plan for their lifecycle inspection. (C) 2015 American Society of Civil Engineers.

This review focuses on understanding their behavior in all aspects of the initiation, evolution, and resolution of the multiple sclerosis (MS) lesion. Astrocytes display remarkable flexibility and variability of their physical structure and biochemical output, each aspect finely tuned to the specific stage and location of the disease, participating in both pathogenic and beneficial changes seen in acute and progressive forms. As examples, chemo-attractive or repulsive molecules may facilitate the entry of destructive immune cells but may also aid in the recruitment of oligodendrocyte precursors, essential for repair. Pro-inflammatory cytokines may attack pathogenic cells and also destroy normal oligodendrocytes, myelin, and axons. Protective trophic factors may also open the blood-brain barrier and modulate the extracellular matrix to favor recruitment and persistence of CNS-specific immune cells. A chronic glial scar may confer structural support following tissue loss and inhibit ingress of further noxious insults and also inhibit migration of reparative cells and molecules into the damaged tissue. Continual study into these processes offers the therapeutic opportunities to enhance the beneficial capabilities of these cells while limiting their destructive effects.

Treatment of brain AVMS (TOBAS): A randomized controlled trial and registry	NEUROCHIRURGIE			Portuguese	Article						Brain arteriovenous malformations; Randomized controlled trial	CEREBRAL ARTERIOVENOUS-MALFORMATIONS; NATURAL-HISTORY; ARUBA TRIAL; MANAGEMENT; METAANALYSIS; CARE	Objective. - The management of unruptured and ruptured brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) remains controversial. The Treatment of Brain AVM Study (TOBAS) was designed to assess curative treatments in the management of AVMs. The purpose of our study is to provide a care trial context to brain AVM patients. Methods. - TOBAS is a pragmatic, prospective study including 2 randomized controlled trials and a registry. All AVM patients can be recruited. The preferred management modality will be predetermined prior to randomization by the team based on clinical judgment. Patients eligible for both conservative and interventional management will be randomly allocated conservative or curative treatment. Randomization will be stratified by a treatment modality (surgery, radiosurgery or embolization) and minimized according to a history of previous rupture and Spetzler-Martin grade. A second randomization will allocate eligible patients to embolization/no embolization prior to surgery or radiosurgery. The primary outcome of the study is death (any cause) or disabling stroke (mRS > 2) at 10 years. All patients managed according to clinical judgment alone will be included in the registry. The study is registered under: wwwTrials.gov, ID: NCT02098252. Expected results. - A minimum recruitment of 540 patients is required to show that treatment can reduce the primary outcome by 10 % (from 25 to 15 %); 440 patients will be needed to show a 10 % increase in angiographic occlusion for a good clinical outcome with pre-embolization. Conclusion. - The trial is designed to offer optimal and verifiable care to patients with brain AVMs in spite of the uncertainty. We are currently seeking the participation of multiple centers.

J	Onwuameze, OE; Titone, D; Ho, BC				Onwuameze, Obiora E.; Titone, Debra; Ho, Beng-Choon			Transitive inference deficits in unaffected biological relatives of schizophrenia patients	SCHIZOPHRENIA RESEARCH			English	Article						Schizophrenia; Family studies; Endophenotype; Cognition; Relational memory; Hippocampus	RELATIONAL MEMORY; DECLARATIVE MEMORY; HIPPOCAMPAL ACTIVATION; COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; EPISODIC MEMORY; WORKING-MEMORY; PARIETAL LOBE; BRAIN; YOUNG	Currently available treatments have limited efficacy in remediating cognitive impairment in schizophrenia. Efforts to facilitate cognition-enhancing drug discovery recommend the use of varied experimental cognitive paradigms (including relational memory) as assessment tools in clinical drug trials. Although relational memory deficits are increasingly being recognized as a reliable cognitive marker of schizophrenia, relational memory performance among unaffected biological relatives remains unknown. Therefore, we evaluated 73 adolescents or young adults (22 first-and 26 second-degree relatives of schizophrenia patients and 25 healthy controls (HC)) using a well-validated transitive inference (TI) experimental paradigm previously used to demonstrate relational memory impairment in schizophrenia. We found that TI deficits were associated with schizophrenia risk with first-degree relatives showing greater impairment than second-degree relatives. First-degree relatives had poorer TI performance with significantly lower accuracy and longer response times than HC when responding to TI probe pairs. Second-degree relatives had significantly quicker response times than first-degree relatives and were more similar to HC in TI performance. We further explored the relationships between TI performance and neurocognitive domains implicated in schizophrenia. Among HC, response times were inversely correlated with FSIQ, verbal learning, processing speed, linguistic abilities and working memory. In contrast, relatives (first-degree in particular) had a differing pattern of TI-neurocognition relationships, which suggest that different brain circuits may be used when relatives encode and retrieve relational memory. Our finding that unaffected biological relatives of schizophrenia patients have TI deficits lends further support for the use of relational memory construct in future pro-cognition drug studies.

Such indicators may help understand the risk trajectory. Methods: We followed up the clinical/developmental trajectories of 84 young offspring born to affected parents descending from the Quebec kindreds affected by schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. We longitudinally characterized childhood trajectories using 5 established risk indicators: cognitive impairments, psychotic-like experiences, non-psychotic DSM diagnosis and episodes of poor functioning, trauma and drug use. Results: Overall, offspring individually presented a high rate of risk indicators with 39% having 3 or more indicators. Thirty-three offspring progressed to an axis 1 DSM-IV disorder, 15 of whom transitioned to a major affective or non-affective disorder. The relative risks for each risk indicator were low in these vulnerable offspring (RR = 1.92 to 2.99). Remarkably, transitioners accumulated more risk indicators in childhood-adolescence than non-transitioners (Wilcoxon rank test; Z = 2.64, p = 0.008). Heterogeneity in the risk trajectories was observed. Outcome was not specific to parent's diagnosis. Conclusion: Young offspring descending from kindreds affected by major psychoses would accumulate risk indicators many years before transition. A clustering of risk factors has also been observed in children at risk of metabolic-cardiovascular disorders and influences practice guidelines in this field. Our findings may be significant for the primary care surveillance of millions of children born to affected parents in the G7 nations. Future longitudinal risk research of children at genetic risk should explore concurrently several intrinsic and environmental risk modalities to increase predictivity.

This new technology has been used during cardiac arrest (CA) because of its ability to give measures in low-blood-flow situations. The aim of this study was to assess the evidence regarding the association between the types of NIRS measurements (mean, initial, and highest values) and resuscitation outcomes (return of spontaneous circulation [ROSC], survival to discharge, and good neurologic outcome) in patients undergoing cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Methods: This review was registered (Prospero CRD42015017380) and is reported as per the PRISMA guidelines. Medline, Embase, and CENTRAL were searched. All studies, except case reports and case series of fewer than five patients, reporting on adults that had NIRS monitoring during CA were eligible for inclusion. Two reviewers assessed the quality of the included articles and extracted the data. The outcome effect was standardized using standardized mean difference (SMD). Results: Twenty nonrandomized observational studies (15 articles and five conference abstracts) were included in this review, for a total of 2,436 patients. We found a stronger association between ROSC and mean NIRS values (SMD = 1.33; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.92 to 1.74) than between ROSC and initial NIRS measurements (SMD = 0.51; 95% CI = 0.23 to 0.78). There was too much heterogeneity among the highest NIRS measurements group to perform meta-analysis. Only two of the 75 patients who experienced ROSC had a mean NIRS saturation under 30%. Patients who survived to discharge and who had good neurologic outcome displayed superior combined initial and mean NIRS values than their counterparts (SMD = 1.63; 95% CI = 1.34 to 1.92; and SMD = 2.12; 95% CI = 1.14 to 3.10). Conclusions: Patients with good resuscitation outcomes have significantly higher NIRS saturations during resuscitation than their counterparts. The types of NIRS measurements during resuscitation influenced the association between ROSC and NIRS saturation. Prolonged failure to obtain a NIRS saturation higher than 30% may be included in a multimodal approach to the decision of terminating resuscitation efforts (Class IIb, Level of Evidence C-Limited Data).

To study bidirectional change and predictors of change in estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and proteinuria in lupus nephritis (LN) using a multistate modeling approach. Methods. Patients in the Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics inception cohort were classified annually into estimated GFR state 1 (>60 ml/minute), state 2 (30-60 ml/minute), or state 3 (<30 ml/minute) and estimated proteinuria state 1 (<0.25 gm/day), state 2 (0.25-3.0 gm/day), or state 3 (>3.0 gm/day), or end-stage renal disease (ESRD) or death. Using multistate modeling, relative transition rates between states indicated improvement and deterioration. Results. Of 1,826 lupus patients, 700 (38.3%) developed LN. During a mean +/- SD follow-up of 5.2 +/- 3.5 years, the likelihood of improvement in estimated GFR and estimated proteinuria was greater than the likelihood of deterioration. After 5 years, 62% of patients initially in estimated GFR state 3 and 11% of patients initially in estimated proteinuria state 3 transitioned to ESRD. The probability of remaining in the initial states 1, 2, and 3 was 85%, 11%, and 3%, respectively, for estimated GFR and 62%, 29%, and 4%, respectively, for estimated proteinuria. Male sex predicted improvement in estimated GFR states; older age, race/ethnicity, higher estimated proteinuria state, and higher renal biopsy chronicity scores predicted deterioration. For estimated proteinuria, race/ethnicity, earlier calendar years, damage scores without renal variables, and higher renal biopsy chronicity scores predicted deterioration; male sex, presence of lupus anticoagulant, class V nephritis, and mycophenolic acid use predicted less improvement. Conclusion. In LN, the expected improvement or deterioration in renal outcomes can be estimated by multistate modeling and is preceded by identifiable risk factors. New therapeutic interventions for LN should meet or exceed these expectations.

J	Costa, M; Lepore, F; Prevost, F; Guillemot, JP				Costa, Margarida; Lepore, Franco; Prevost, Francois; Guillemot, Jean-Paul			Effects of aging on peripheral and central auditory processing in rats	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						age-related; auditory brainstem responses; otoacoustic emissions; presbycusis; topographic map	PRODUCT OTOACOUSTIC EMISSIONS; BRAIN-STEM RESPONSE; AGE-RELATED-CHANGES; SUPERIOR COLLICULUS; INFERIOR COLLICULUS; HEARING-LOSS; EVOKED POTENTIALS; FISCHER-344 RATS; MOUSE MODEL; SPACE	Hearing loss is a hallmark sign in the elderly population. Decline in auditory perception provokes deficits in the ability to localize sound sources and reduces speech perception, particularly in noise. In addition to a loss of peripheral hearing sensitivity, changes in more complex central structures have also been demonstrated. Related to these, this study examines the auditory directional maps in the deep layers of the superior colliculus of the rat. Hence, anesthetized Sprague-Dawley adult (10months) and aged (22months) rats underwent distortion product of otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) to assess cochlear function. Then, auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) were assessed, followed by extracellular single-unit recordings to determine age-related effects on central auditory functions. DPOAE amplitude levels were decreased in aged rats although they were still present between 3.0 and 24.0 kHz. ABR level thresholds in aged rats were significantly elevated at an early (cochlear nucleus - wave II) stage in the auditory brainstem. In the superior colliculus, thresholds were increased and the tuning widths of the directional receptive fields were significantly wider. Moreover, no systematic directional spatial arrangement was present among the neurons of the aged rats, implying that the topographical organization of the auditory directional map was abolished. These results suggest that the deterioration of the auditory directional spatial map can, to some extent, be attributable to age-related dysfunction at more central, perceptual stages of auditory processing.

Current research aims at understanding the biological underpinnings of this complex cognitive function and the basis of individual variability. We used 3 T proton Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy to measure in vivo glutamate, GABA, N-acetyl-aspartate (NAA), and myo-inositol levels at rest in the right dorsal prefrontal cortex of 54 participants, comprising 24 unmedicated depressed patients and 30 healthy individuals. Participants were also tested with the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT), a classical measure of value-based decision-making. No group differences were found in terms of compound levels or decision-making performance. However, high inositol levels were associated with lower decision-making scores independently from group, notably during the initial stage of the task when explicit rules are still unknown and decisions are largely based on implicit processes (whole sample: F=4.0; p=0.02), with a large effect size (Cohens d=0.8, 95% [0.2-1.5]). This effect was stronger when explicit knowledge was taken into account, with explicit knowledge showing an independent effect on performance. There was no association with other compounds. This study suggests, for the first time, a role for the inositol pathway on the implicit learning component of decision-making, without any direct effect on the explicit component. Hypothesized mechanisms implicate intracellular calcium modulation and subsequent synaptic plasticity. These findings represent a first step inthe understanding of the biochemical mechanisms underlying decision-making and the identification of therapeutic targets. They also emphasize a dimensional approach in the study of the neurobiological determinants of mental disorders. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. and ECNP. All rights reserved.

OBJECTIVE To examine whether common risk variants for psychosis are associated with individual variation in the VS. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A cross-sectional study of a large cohort of adolescents from the IMAGEN study (a European multicenter study of reinforcement sensitivity in adolescents) was performed from March 1, 2008, through December 31, 2011. Data analysis was conducted from October 1, 2015, to January 9, 2016. Polygenic risk profile scores (RPSs) for psychosis were generated for 1841 healthy adolescents. Sample size and characteristics varied across regression analyses, depending on mutual information available (N = 15241836). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Reward-related brain function was assessed with blood oxygen level dependency (BOLD) in the VS using the monetary incentive delay (MID) task, distinguishing reward anticipation and receipt. Behavioral impulsivity, IQ, MID task performance, and VS BOLD were regressed against psychosis RPS at 4 progressive P thresholds (P < .01, P < .05, P < .10, and P < .50 for RPS models 1-4, respectively). RESULTS In a sample of 1841 healthy adolescents (mean age, 14.5 years; 906 boys and 935 girls), we replicated an association between increasing psychosis RPS and reduced IQ (matrix reasoning: corrected P = .003 for RPS model 2, 0.4% variance explained), supporting the validity of the psychosis RPS models. We also found a nominally significant association between increased psychosis RPS and reduced MID task performance (uncorrected P = .03 for RPS model 4, 0.2% variance explained). Our main finding was a positive association between psychosis RPS and VS BOLD during reward anticipation at all 4 psychosis RPS models and for 2 P thresholds for reward receipt (RPS models 1 and 3), correcting for the familywise error rate (0.8%-1.9% variance explained). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE These findings support an association between psychosis RPS and VS BOLD in adolescents. Genetic risk for psychosis may shape an individual's response to rewarding stimuli.

This disease is characterised by a defect in the lipidation of APO B and the absence of VLDL and chylomicron production. Patients affected by ABL present neurological, hemalogical and gastro-intestinal symptoms due to deficiency in lipophilic vitamins and fat malabsorption. We herein report the case of two cousins, one presenting classical symptoms of abetalipoproteinemia and one presenting a much attenuated phenotype. The proband carried a novel combination of MTTP mutations, the 1867+1G>A and the R540C mutations. This patient never received any vitamin supplements and was relatively free of symptoms despite an undetectable APO B concentration. Her cousin was homozygous for 1867+1G>A MTTP mutation and presented most of the classical symptoms of ABL. In conclusion we report a very unusual kindred where on affected member is strongly symptomatic of ABL whereas the other presents very mostly asymptomatic disease suggesting that ABL can present itself with a very incomplete clinical penetrance.

In this report, we present the case of a young man with a normal lipid profile and Achilles tendon xanthoma. Biochemical and genetic studies confirmed the diagnosis of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis in this patient. Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis is a rare autosomal recessive disease associated with xanthoma in tendons and the brain as well as progressive neurologic deficits. Unfortunately, this rare form of reversible dementia is thought to be underdiagnosed. Early diagnosis and treatment of this disease with chenodeoxycholic acid is essential and has been shown to greatly improve the patient's symptoms and prognosis. (C) 2016 National Lipid Association.

We hypothesized that individuals with MCR syndrome would have lower brain volumes compared with non-MCR individuals. This study aims (i) to compare the cognitive profile of nondemented older community-dwellers with and without MCR syndrome and (ii) to examine association of global and regional brain volumes with MCR syndrome. A total of 171 individuals (28 MCR and 143 non-MCR) were included in this cross-sectional study. Total white matter abnormalities, total white matter, total cortical and subcortical gray matters, hippocampus, motor cortex, premotor cortex, and prefrontal cortex were examined. Brain volumes were quantified from a three-dimensional T-1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging using semi-automated software. Age, gender, education level, number of drugs taken daily, use of psychoactive drugs, and cognitive profile were also measured. The distribution of cognitively healthy individuals and those with mild cognitive impairment was not different in participants with and without MCR. Multiple logistic regression models showed that smaller volumes of total gray matter (p = .016), total cortical gray matter (p = .010), premotor cortex (p = .018), prefrontal cortex (p = .026), and dorsolateral segment of prefrontal cortex (p = .032) were associated with MCR status. The premotor cortex presented the highest mean difference for brain regional volume between MCR and non-MCR participants (p = .03). The findings revealed similar cognitive profile in MCR and non-MCR participants, and MCR-related smaller global and regional gray matter volumes involving premotor and prefrontal cortices, suggesting that the MCR syndrome may predict cortical neurodegenerative dementia more than subcortical dementia.

Localization and patterns of Cerebral dyschromatopsia: A study of subjects with prospagnosia	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Hue discrimination; Colour perception; Face recognition; Fourier analysis; Fusiform gyrus	MUNSELL 100-HUE TEST; COLOR-VISION; DEVELOPMENTAL PROSOPAGNOSIA; TEMPORAL CORTEX; BRAIN-LESIONS; ACHROMATOPSIA; PATIENT; PERCEPTION; CONSTANCY; HEMIACHROMATOPSIA	Objective: Cerebral dyschromatopsia is sometimes associated with acquired prosopagnosia. Given the variability in structural lesions that cause acquired prosopagnosia, this study aimed to investigate the structural correlates of prosopagnosia-associated dyschromatopsia, and to determine if such colour processing deficits could also accompany developmental prosopagnosia. In addition, we studied whether cerebral dyschromatopsia is typified by a consistent pattern of hue impairments. Methods: We investigated hue discrimination in a cohort of 12 subjects with acquired prosopagnosia and 9 with developmental prosopagnosia, along with 42 matched controls, using the Farnsworth-Munsell 100-hue test. Results: We found impaired hue discrimination in six subjects with acquired prosopagnosia, five with bilateral and one with a unilateral occipitotemporal lesion. Structural MRI analysis showed maximum overlap of lesions in the right and left lingual and fusiform gyri. Fourier analysis of their error scores showed tritanopic-like deficits and blue-green impairments, similar to tendencies displayed by the healthy controls. Three subjects also showed a novel fourth Fourier component, indicating additional peak deficits in purple and green-yellow regions. No subject with developmental prosopagnosia had impaired hue discrimination. Conclusions: In our subjects with prosopagnosia, dyschromatopsia occurred in those with acquired lesions of the fusiform gyri, usually bilateral but sometimes unilateral. The dyschromatopsic deficit shows mainly an accentuation of normal tritatanopic-like tendencies. These are sometimes accompanied by additional deficits, although these could represent artifacts of the testing procedure. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Typically, music conveys and induces emotions even when one does not attend to them. Studies on the neural substrates of musical emotions have, however, only examined brain activity when subjects have focused on the emotional content of the music. Here we address with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) the neural processing of happy, sad, and fearful music with a paradigm in which 56 subjects were instructed to either classify the emotions (explicit condition) or pay attention to the number of instruments playing (implicit condition) in 4-s music clips. In the implicit vs. explicit condition, stimuli activated bilaterally the inferior parietal lobule, premotor cortex, caudate, and ventromedial frontal areas. The cortical dorsomedial prefrontal and occipital areas activated during explicit processing were those previously shown to be associated with the cognitive processing of music and emotion recognition and regulation. Moreover, happiness in music was associated with activity in the bilateral auditory cortex, left parahippocampal gyrus, and supplementary motor area, whereas the negative emotions of sadness and fear corresponded with activation of the left anterior cingulate and middle frontal gyrus and down-regulation of the orbitofrontal cortex. Our study demonstrates for the first time in healthy subjects the neural underpinnings of the implicit processing of brief musical emotions, particularly in frontoparietal, dorsolateral prefrontal, and striatal areas of the brain.

However, in this population, RBCs are sometimes added to the cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) priming solution to maintain a predefined hematocrit on bypass. In this study, we investigated the impact of RBCs added to the CPB on severe postoperative morbidity or mortality. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study was conducted between 2006 and 2012 in a tertiary care level, children's hospital. Children receiving red cells only to prime the CPB (CPB transfusion) were compared with those receiving no RBCs during their entire hospital stay. The primary outcome was severe postoperative morbidity or mortality. Studied secondary outcomes were neurologic deficit, infection, length of mechanical ventilation, pediatric intensive care unit and hospital length of stay, and mortality. Both groups were compared with propensity score analysis where patients were matched via a genetic matching algorithm. In all analyses, applying a Bonferroni correction, a P value <.05/8 = .00625, was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: Among the 854 patients retained for this study, 439 (51.4%) received no RBC transfusion during their entire hospital stay and 415 (49.6%) received a CPB transfusion. Thirty-five (8.0%) patients in the no-transfusion group and 110 (26.5%) patients in the CPB transfusion group developed severe postoperative morbidity or died. This difference was statistically significant using univariate analysis (P < .001). Propensity score analysis showed that 79 (19.55%) patients developed severe postoperative morbidity or died in the no-transfusion group compared with 103 (25.50%) patients in the CPB transfusion group (P = .043). The relative risk and its Bonferroni-corrected confidence interval was 0.77 (0.53-1.10). All secondary outcomes were not significantly different between both groups, except the number of patients who developed infections (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: In the condition of our study, adding RBCs to the CPB priming to maintain a predefined hematocrit does not seem to impact markedly severe postoperative morbidity or mortality in children undergoing cardiac surgery. Only the risk of infection was increased in the CPB transfusion group. Further studies are warranted to better understand the complex interaction among severity of illness, anemia, RBCs transfusion, and outcome in children undergoing cardiac surgery.

Circulating Chemerin Is Associated With Carotid Plaque Instability, Whereas Resistin Is Related to Cerebrovascular Symptomatology	ARTERIOSCLEROSIS THROMBOSIS AND VASCULAR BIOLOGY			English	Article						adiponectin; carotid plaque instability; cerebrovascular symptomatology; chemerin; leptin; resistin	MOLECULAR-WEIGHT ADIPONECTIN; TYPE-2 DIABETIC-PATIENTS; CORONARY-ARTERY-DISEASE; CARDIOVASCULAR-DISEASE; ISCHEMIC-STROKE; ATHEROSCLEROTIC LESIONS; METABOLIC SYNDROME; HEART-DISEASE; LEPTIN; INFLAMMATION	Objective The rupture of unstable carotid atherosclerotic plaques is one of the main causes of cerebrovascular ischemic events. There is need for circulating markers that can predict plaque instability and risk of stroke. Proinflammatory chemerin, leptin, and resistin, along with anti-inflammatory adiponectin, are adipokines with direct influence on vascular function. We investigated the association of circulating adipokines with carotid plaque instability and cerebrovascular symptomatology. Approach and Results Neurologically symptomatic and asymptomatic patients (n=165) scheduled for carotid endarterectomy were recruited. Fasting blood samples were collected preoperatively; adiponectin and leptin levels were determined by radioimmunoassay; and chemerin and resistin levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. The instability of plaque specimens was assessed using gold-standard histological classifications. Chemerin was significantly associated with plaque instability. The fully adjusted model, accounting for age, sex, body mass index, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and circulating adiponectin, leptin, and resistin, yielded an odds ratio of 0.991 (95% confidence interval 0.985-0.998) for plaque instability per unit increase in chemerin. High leptin levels were significantly associated with presence of specific features of plaque instability. In subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus, resistin levels were significantly elevated in symptomatic when compared with asymptomatic subjects (P=0.001) and increased the risk of cerebrovascular symptomatology (adjusted odds ratio 1.264, 95% confidence interval 1.004-1.594). Conclusions Low chemerin and high resistin levels were associated with carotid disease severity, suggesting that these adipokines may act as potential markers for plaque instability and stroke risk. Future studies are needed to assess causation between circulating adipokines and plaque instability.

This analysis aimed to comprehensively evaluate bevacizumab pharmacokinetics and the influence of patient variables on bevacizumab pharmacokinetics. Rich and sparse bevacizumab serum concentrations were collected from Phase I through IV studies in early and metastatic cancers. Bevacizumab was given intravenously as single agent or in combination with chemotherapy for single- and multiple-dose schedules. Model-building used 8943 bevacizumab concentrations from 1792 patients with colon/colorectal, non-small cell lung, kidney, pancreatic, breast, prostate and brain cancer. Bevacizumab doses ranged from 1 to 20 mg/kg given once every 1, 2 or 3 weeks. A two-compartment model best described the data. The population estimates of clearance (CL), central volume of distribution (V1) and half-life for a typical 70-kg patient were 9.01 mL/h, 2.88 L and 19.6 days. CL and V1 increased with body weight and were higher in males than females by 14 and 18 %, respectively. CL decreased with increasing albumin and decreasing alkaline phosphatase. The final model was externally validated using 1670 concentrations from 146 Japanese patients that were not used for model-building. Mean prediction errors were -2.1, 3.1 and 1.0 % for concentrations, CL and V1, respectively, confirming adequate predictive performance. A robust bevacizumab pharmacokinetic model was developed and externally validated, which may be used to simulate bevacizumab exposure to optimize dosing strategies. Asian and non-Asian patients exhibited similar bevacizumab pharmacokinetics. Given the similarity in pharmacokinetics among monoclonal antibodies, this may inform pharmacokinetic studies in different ethnic groups for other therapeutic antibodies.

An additional 3 European centers have partnered with the PIDTC to study CGD. Natural history protocols of the PIDTC analyze outcomes of treatment for rare PIDs in multicenter longitudinal retrospective, prospective, and cross-sectional studies. Since 2009, participating centers have enrolled more than 800 subjects on PIDTC protocols for SCID, and enrollment in the studies on WAS and CGD is underway. Four pilot projects have been funded, and 12 junior investigators have received fellowship awards. Important publications of the consortium describe the outcomes of hematopoietic cell transplantation for SCID during 2000-2009, diagnostic criteria for SCID, and the pilot project of newborn screening for SCID in the Navajo Nation. The PIDTC Annual Scientific Workshops provide an opportunity to strengthen collaborations with junior investigators, patient advocacy groups, and international colleagues. Funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and the Office of Rare Diseases Research, National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, the PIDTC has recently received renewal for another 5 years. Here we review accomplishments of the group, projects underway, highlights of recent workshops, and challenges for the future.

Impaired blood-retinal barrier function leads to macular edema that is closely associated with the deterioration of central vision. We previously demonstrated that the neuronal guidance cue netrin-1 activates a program of reparative angiogenesis in microglia within the ischemic retina. Here, we provide evidence in both vitreous humor of diabetic patients and in retina of a murine model of diabetes that netrin-1 is metabolized into a bioactive fragment corresponding to domains VI and V of the full-length molecule. In contrast to the protective effects of full-length netrin-1 on retinal microvasculature, the VI-V fragment promoted vascular permeability through the uncoordinated 5B (UNC5B) receptor. The collagenase matrix metalloprotease 9 (MMP-9), which is increased in patients with diabetic macular edema, was capable of cleaving netrin-1 into the VI-V fragment. Thus, MMP-9 may release netrin-1 fragments from the extracellular matrix and facilitate diffusion. Nonspecific inhibition of collagenases or selective inhibition of MMP-9 decreased pathological vascular permeability in a murine model of diabetic retinal edema. This study reveals that netrin-1 degradation products are capable of modulating vascular permeability, suggesting that these fragments are of potential therapeutic interest for the treatment of DR.

In addition to memory complaints, impairments in the visuospatial domain have been reported in this condition. We have previously shown that deficits in perceiving structure-from-motion (SFM) objects are reflected in functional reorganization of brain activity within the visual ventral stream. Here we aimed to identify structural correlates of psychophysical complex face and object recognition performance in amnestic MCI patients (n=30 vs. n=25 controls). This study was, therefore, motivated by evidence from recent studies showing that a combination of visual information across dorsal and ventral visual streams may be needed for the perception of three-dimensional (3D) SFM objects. Methods: In our experimental paradigm, participants had to discriminate 3D SFM shapes (faces and objects) from 3D SFM meaningless (scrambled) shapes. Results: Morphometric analysis established neuroanatomical evidence for impairment in MCI as demonstrated by smaller hippocampal volumes. We found association between cortical thickness and face recognition performance, comprising the occipital lobe and visual ventral stream fusiform regions (overlapping the known location of face fusiform area) in the right hemisphere, in MCI. Conclusions: We conclude that impairment of 3D visual integration exists at the MCI stage involving also the visual ventral stream and contributing to face recognition deficits. The specificity of such observed structure-function correlation for faces suggests a special role of this processing pathway in health and disease.

The parasubiculum, which receives input from multiple hippocampal subfields, sends its single major output projection to layer II of the entorhinal cortex, suggesting that it may modulate processing of synaptic inputs to the entorhinal cortex. Indeed, stimulation of the parasubiculum can enhance entorhinal responses to synaptic input from the piriform cortex in vivo. Theta EEG activity contributes to spatial and mnemonic processes in this region, and the current study assessed how stimulation of the parasubiculum with either single pulses or short, five-pulse, theta-frequency trains may modulate synaptic responses in layer II entorhinal stellate neurons evoked by stimulation of layer I afferents in vitro. Parasubicular stimulation pulses or trains suppressed responses to layer I stimulation at intervals of 5 ms, and parasubicular stimulation trains facilitated layer I responses at a train-pulse interval of 25 ms. This suggests that firing of parasubicular neurons during theta activity may heterosynaptically enhance incoming sensory inputs to the entorhinal cortex. Bath application of the hyperpolarization-activated cation current (I-h) blocker ZD7288 enhanced the facilitation effect, suggesting that cholinergic inhibition of I-h may contribute. In addition, repetitive pairing of parasubicular trains and layer I stimulation induced a lasting depression of entorhinal responses to layer I stimulation. These findings provide evidence that theta activity in the parasubiculum may promote heterosynaptic modulation effects that may alter sensory processing in the entorhinal cortex.

The extent to which the upper-limb flexor synergy constrains or compensates for arm motor impairment during reaching is controversial. This synergy can be quantified with a minimal marker set describing movements of the arm-plane. Objectives. To determine whether and how (a) upper-limb flexor synergy in patients with chronic stroke contributes to reaching movements to different arm workspace locations and (b) reaching deficits can be characterized by arm-plane motion. Methods. Sixteen post-stroke and 8 healthy control subjects made unrestrained reaching movements to targets located in ipsilateral, central, and contralateral arm workspaces. Arm-plane, arm, and trunk motion, and their temporal and spatial linkages were analyzed. Results. Individuals with moderate/severe stroke used greater arm-plane movement and compensatory trunk movement compared to those with mild stroke and control subjects. Arm-plane and trunk movements were more temporally coupled in stroke compared with controls. Reaching accuracy was related to different segment and joint combinations for each target and group: arm-plane movement in controls and mild stroke subjects, and trunk and elbow movements in moderate/severe stroke subjects. Arm-plane movement increased with time since stroke and when combined with trunk rotation, discriminated between different subject groups for reaching the central and contralateral targets. Trunk movement and arm-plane angle during target reaches predicted the subject group. Conclusions. The upper-limb flexor synergy was used adaptively for reaching accuracy by patients with mild, but not moderate/severe stroke. The flexor synergy, as parameterized by the amount of arm-plane motion, can be used by clinicians to identify levels of motor recovery in patients with stroke.

Defining the neuroanatomic basis of motor coordination in children and its relationship with symptoms of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder	PSYCHOLOGICAL MEDICINE			English	Article						Attention-deficit; hyperactivity disorder; brain imaging; cerebellum; cortex; motor coordination	OF-THE-LITERATURE; HUMAN BRAIN; SEX-DIFFERENCES; ADHD; CORTEX; PERFORMANCE; CEREBELLUM; ACTIVATION; VOLUME; SKILLS	Background When children have marked problems with motor coordination, they often have problems with attention and impulse control. Here, we map the neuroanatomic substrate of motor coordination in childhood and ask whether this substrate differs in the presence of concurrent symptoms of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Method Participants were 226 children. All completed Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fifth edition (DSM-5)-based assessment of ADHD symptoms and standardized tests of motor coordination skills assessing aiming/catching, manual dexterity and balance. Symptoms of developmental coordination disorder (DCD) were determined using parental questionnaires. Using 3 Tesla magnetic resonance data, four latent neuroanatomic variables (for the cerebral cortex, cerebellum, basal ganglia and thalamus) were extracted and mapped onto each motor coordination skill using partial least squares pathway modeling. Results The motor coordination skill of aiming/catching was significantly linked to latent variables for both the cerebral cortex (t = 4.31, p < 0.0001) and the cerebellum (t = 2.31, p = 0.02). This effect was driven by the premotor/motor cortical regions and the superior cerebellar lobules. These links were not moderated by the severity of symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity. In categorical analyses, the DCD group showed atypical reduction in the volumes of these regions. However, the group with DCD alone did not differ significantly from those with DCD and co-morbid ADHD. Conclusions The superior cerebellar lobules and the premotor/motor cortex emerged as pivotal neural substrates of motor coordination in children. The dimensions of these motor coordination regions did not differ significantly between those who had DCD, with or without co-morbid ADHD.

Functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is an emerging technology that offers benefits in this population because it is non-invasive, compatible with CI devices, and not subject to electrical artifacts. However, there are important considerations to be made when using fNIRS to maximize the signal to noise ratio and to best identify meaningful cortical responses. This review considers these issues, the current data, and future directions for using fNIRS as a clinical application in individuals with CIs.

This study also seeks to determine which types of fractures present with the highest incidence of mild TBI. Patients and methods: Retrospective assessment of mild TBI among orthopaedic monotrauma patients, randomly selected for participation in an Orthopaedic clinic of a Level I Trauma Hospital. Patients in the remission phase of a limb fracture were recruited between August 2014 and May 2015. No intervention was done (observational study). Main outcome measurements: Standardized semi-structured interviews were conducted with all patients to retrospectively assess for mild TBI at the time of the fracture. Emergency room related medical records of all patients were carefully analyzed to determine whether a prospective mild TBI diagnosis was made following the accident. Results: A total of 251 patients were recruited (54% females, Mean age = 49). Study interview revealed a 23.5% incidence rate of mild TBI compared to an incidence rate of 8.8% for prospective diagnosis (chi(2) = 78.47; p < 0.0001). Patients suffering from an upper limb monotrauma (29.6%; n = 42/142) are significantly more at risk of sustaining a mild TBI compared to lower limb fractures (15.6%; n = 17/109) (chi(2) = 6.70; p = 0.010). More specifically, patients with a proximal upper limb injury were significantly more at risk of sustaining concomitant mild TBI (40.6%; 26/64) compared to distal upper limb fractures (20.25%; 16/79) (chi(2) = 7.07; p = 0.008). Conclusions: Results suggest an important concomitance of mild TBI among orthopaedic trauma patients, the majority of which go undetected during acute care. Patients treated for an upper limb fracture are particularly at risk of sustaining concomitant mild TBI. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The gravity of this global issue is reflected by the United Nations' new effort to respond to sexual abuse in the 2015 Sustainable Development Goals. The fundamental policy aims are to improve prevention, identification, and optimal responses to sexual abuse. As shown in our literature review, policymakers face difficult challenges because child sexual abuse is hidden, psychologically complex, and socially sensitive. This article offers new ideas for international progress. Insights about needed strategies are informed by an innovative multidisciplinary analysis of research from public health, medicine, social science, psychology, and neurology. Using an ecological model comprising individual, institutional, and societal dimensions, we propose that two preconditions for progress are the enhancement of awareness of child sexual abuse, and of empathic responses towards its victims.

J	Preault, A; Capron, F; Chantereau, C; Donati, F; Dimet, J				Preault, Alice; Capron, Florent; Chantereau, Celine; Donati, Francois; Dimet, Jerome			Under sevoflurane anaesthesia, a reduced dose of neostigmine can antagonize a shallow neuromuscular block: A double-blind, randomised study	ANAESTHESIA CRITICAL CARE & PAIN MEDICINE			English	Article						Anaesthesia; Muscle relaxants	PARTIALLY PARALYZED HUMANS; RESIDUAL PARALYSIS; TRAIN-OF-4; MUSCLE; ACCELEROMYOGRAPHY; VECURONIUM; ATRACURIUM; ROCURONIUM; RECOVERY; RATIO	Background: It has been demonstrated that small doses of neostigmine (10-30 mu g.kg(-1)) effectively antagonize atracurium blocks at a train-of-four (TOF) ratio of 0.4 under propofol anaesthesia. The results might not be valid with halogenated agents, which potentiate neuromuscular blockades. The goal of this study was to determine the dose of neostigmine required to antagonize a block corresponding to a TOF ratio of 0.4, a level at which fade is not visually detected. Methods: Sixty patients were included and anaesthesia was induced with propofol, remifentanil and cisatracurium, and maintained with sevoflurane and remifentanil. Patients were randomized to receive neostigmine at 40, 20, 10 mu g.kg(-1) or placebo with atropine (20, 10, 5 or 0 mu g.kg(-1), respectively) as soon as the TOF ratio reached 0.4. Elapsed times to 0.9 and 1.0 TOF ratios were measured. Results: The median times elapsed from 0.4 to 0.9 and 1.0 TOF ratios in the placebo group were 19 (10.5-36) min and 26 (20-50) min, respectively, and significantly shorter (I = 0.002) with any dose of neostigmine than without. Times for complete recovery after 40 and 20 mu g.kg(-1) neostigmine were similar [5.5 (4-11) min and 7.8 (3.5-11) min, respectively] but significantly shorter than after 10 mu g.kg(-1) neostigmine [17 min (7-55); I = 0.001]. Conclusion: Under sevoflurane anaesthesia, in absence of tactile or visual TOF fade, which corresponds to a TOF ratio >= 0.4, 20 mu g.kg(-1) neostigmine is as effective as 40 mu g.kg(-1) in antagonizing shallow cisatracurium block.

All compounds were selective mu opioid agonists and the Tmt(1)-, Emt(1) and Det(1)-analogues showed subnanomolar mu opioid receptor binding affinities. The Tmt(1)- and Emt(1)-analogues showed improved antioxidant activity compared to the Dmt(1)-parent peptide in the DPPH radical-scavenging capacity assay, and thus are of interest as drug candidates for neuropathic pain treatment.

Association of serum selenium with thyroxin in severely iodine-deficient young children from the Amhara region of Ethiopia	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NUTRITION			English	Article							THYROID-HORMONE METABOLISM; GOITER PERSISTENCE; BRAIN-DEVELOPMENT; SCHOOL-CHILDREN; HUMAN HEALTH; SCHOOLCHILDREN; BIOCHEMISTRY; POPULATION; PREVALENCE; DISORDERS	BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Selenium (Se) as part of glutathione peroxidase and iodothyronine deiodinase enzymes influences thyroid metabolism. This study investigated the association of serum Se levels with thyroid metabolism of severely iodine-deficient young children from the Amhara region of Ethiopia. SUBJECTS/METHODS: In a cross-sectional study, Se, thyroid-stimulating hormone, total thyroxin, total triiodothyronine and thyroglobulin in serum of children (N = 628) 54-60 months of age from the Amhara region, Ethiopia, were analyzed. In addition, iodine in urine and household salt was analyzed, and the presence of goiter was assessed. RESULTS: The median serum Se concentration was 61.4 mu g/l (10.7-290.9 mu g/l). Selenium deficiency (serum Se < 70 mu g/l) was detected in 57.8% (N = 349) of the children. The median urinary iodine concentration (UIC) was 9.8 mu g/l. The majority (86.6%, N = 449) of children had UIC below the recommended value (100 mu g/l). In addition, 59.8% (N = 310) of children were severely iodine deficient (UIC < 20 mu g/l). Only 12.7% of salt samples had iodine. Goiter was present in 44.6% (N = 280) of the children. Selenium-deficient children had higher serum thyroxin (T-4) than children with normal serum Se concentration (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Serum Se was negatively associated with T-4 level in young children from the Amhara region of Ethiopia and may endanger the effectiveness of the salt iodization program.

In particular, the authors focus on innovative chemical screens that have established simple organisms as important models for ALS drug discovery.Expert opinion: There are several advantages of using simple animal model organisms to accelerate drug discovery for ALS. It is the authors' particular belief that the amenability of simple animal models to various genetic manipulations, the availability of a wide range of transgenic strains for labelling motoneurons and other cell types, combined with live imaging and chemical screens should allow for new detailed studies elucidating early pathological processes in ALS and subsequent drug and target discovery.

An ERP study of recognition memory for concrete and abstract pictures in school-aged children	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Abstract; Children; Concrete; Event-related potentials; Familiarity; Recognition memory	MEDIAL TEMPORAL-LOBE; MATERIAL-SPECIFIC LATERALIZATION; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; HEMISPHERIC-SPECIALIZATION; VIEWPOINT INVARIANCE; EXPLICIT MEMORY; N400 POTENTIALS; RECOLLECTION; FAMILIARITY; RETRIEVAL	Recognition memory for concrete, nameable pictures is typically faster and more accurate than for abstract pictures. A dual-coding account for these findings suggests that concrete pictures are processed into verbal and image codes, whereas abstract pictures are encoded in image codes only. Recognition memory relies on two successive and distinct processes, namely familiarity and recollection. Whether these two processes are similarly or differently affected by stimulus concreteness remains unknown. This study examined the effect of picture concreteness on visual recognition memory processes using event-related potentials (ERPs). In a sample of children involved in a longitudinal study, participants (N = 96; mean age = 11.3 years) were assessed on a continuous visual recognition memory task in which half the pictures were easily nameable, everyday concrete objects, and the other half were three-dimensional abstract, sculpture-like objects. Behavioral performance and ERP correlates of familiarity and recollection (respectively, the FN400 and P600 repetition effects) were measured. Behavioral results indicated faster and more accurate identification of concrete pictures as "new" or "old" (i.e., previously displayed) compared to abstract pictures. ERPs were characterized by a larger repetition effect, on the P600 amplitude, for concrete than for abstract images, suggesting a graded recollection process dependent on the type of material to be recollected. Topographic differences were observed within the FN400 latency interval, especially over anterior-inferior electrodes, with the repetition effect more pronounced and localized over the left hemisphere for concrete stimuli, potentially reflecting different neural processes underlying early processing of verbal/semantic and visual material in memory.

This learning ensues when one experiences a change in environmental contingencies, that is, when an expected outcome fails to occur (simple extinction), or when a novel inflated expectation of a double outcome (overexpectation) is in conflict with the real outcome, and is a process that has been linked to amygdala function. Here, we show that in rats, the same neuronal population in the amygdala central nucleus updates reward expectancies and behaviour in both types of extinction, and neural changes in one paradigm are reflected in the other. This work may have implications for the management of addiction and anxiety disorders that require treatments based on the outcome omission, and disorders such as obesity that could use overexpectation, but not omission strategies.

Prefrontal White Matter Structure Mediates the Influence of GADI on Working Memory	NEUROPSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article							TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; CORTICAL INHIBITION; COGNITIVE CONTROL; BIPOLAR DISORDER; GENE-EXPRESSION; RTMS TREATMENT; SCHIZOPHRENIA; CORTEX; DEPRESSION; RECEPTORS	The glutamic acid decarboxylase 1 (GAD1) gene is a major determinant of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), the most abundant inhibitory neurotransmitter modulating local neuronal circuitry. GABAergic dysfunction and expression of GAD1 have been implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, and in working memory impairment. We examined the influence of the functional GAD1 rs3749034 variant on white matter fractional anisotropy (FA), cortical thickness, and working memory performance in schizophrenia patients and healthy controls (N=197). Using transcranial magnetic stimulation with electroencephalography (TMS-EEG), we subsequently examined the effect of rs3749034 on long-interval cortical inhibition (LICI) in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in schizophrenia patients and healthy controls (N= 66). We found that the rs3749034 T-allele carrier risk group had lower voxel-wise FA in the prefrontal cortex region (PFWE-corrected <0.05) but not cortical thickness. Mixed-model regression revealed a significant effect on attentional processing and working memory across four performance measures (F-1,F-182 = 11.5, P = 8x10(-4)). FA in the prefrontal cortex was associated with digit-span performance. Voxel-wise mediation analysis revealed that the effect GAD1 on poorer digit-span performance statistically predicted the lower white matter FA (PFWE-corrected <0.05). In exploratory analysis, we found a prominent GAD1 genotype-by-diagnosis interaction on DLPFC LICI (F-1,F-56 = 14.3, P=4.1 x 10(-4)). Our findings converge on variation in GAD1 gene predicting a susceptibility mechanism that affects white matter FA, GABAergic inhibitory neurotransmission in the DLPFC, and working memory performance. Furthermore, via voxel mediation of FA and TMS-EEG intervention, we provide evidence for a potentially causal mechanism through which aberrant DLPFC GABA signaling may contribute to working memory dysfunction.

Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy Is Associated With Executive Dysfunction and Mild Cognitive Impairment	STROKE			English	Article						Alzheimer's disease; cerebral amyloid angiopathy; cognitive impairment; intracerebral hemorrhage; magnetic resonance imaging	SMALL VESSEL DISEASE; NATIONAL INSTITUTE; DIAGNOSTIC GUIDELINES; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; OLDER PERSONS; STROKE; RECOMMENDATIONS; WORKGROUPS; STANDARDS; DEMENTIA	Background and Purpose-Autopsy studies suggest that cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is associated with cognitive impairment and risk for dementia. We analyzed neuropsychological test data from a prospective cohort study of patients with CAA to identify the prevalence of cognitive impairment and its associations with brain magnetic resonance imaging features and the apolipoprotein E genotype. Methods-Data were analyzed from 34 CAA, 16 Alzheimer's disease, 69 mild cognitive impairment, and 27 ischemic stroke participants. Neuropsychological test results were expressed as z scores in relation to normative data provided by the test manuals and then grouped into domains of memory, executive function, and processing speed. Results-Mean test scores in CAA participants were significantly lower than norms for memory (-0.44 +/- 1.03; P=0.02), executive function (-1.14 +/- 1.07; P<0.001), and processing speed (-1.06 +/- 1.12; P<0.001). Twenty-seven CAA participants (79%) had mild cognitive impairment based on low cognitive performance accompanied by cognitive concerns. CAA participants had similarly low executive function scores as Alzheimer's disease, but relatively preserved memory. CAA participants' scores were lower than those of ischemic stroke controls for executive function and processing speed. Lower processing speed scores in CAA were associated with higher magnetic resonance imaging white matter hyperintensity volume. There were no associations with the apolipoprotein E e4 allele. Conclusions-Mild cognitive impairment is very prevalent in CAA. The overall cognitive profile of CAA is more similar to that seen in vascular cognitive impairment rather than Alzheimer's disease. White matter ischemic lesions may underlie some of the impaired processing speed in CAA.

Postmortem evidence of cerebral inflammation in schizophrenia: a systematic review	MOLECULAR PSYCHIATRY			English	Review							FIBRILLARY ACIDIC PROTEIN; ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; DORSOLATERAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; MAJOR-DEPRESSIVE-DISORDER; PLACEBO-CONTROLLED-TRIAL; MEDIODORSAL THALAMIC NUCLEUS; NECROSIS-FACTOR-ALPHA; NEURONAL SOMAL SIZE; GLIAL-CELL DENSITY; BIPOLAR-DISORDER	Schizophrenia is a psychiatric disorder which has a lifetime prevalence of similar to 1%. Multiple candidate mechanisms have been proposed in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. One such mechanism is the involvement of neuroinflammation. Clinical studies, including neuroimaging, peripheral biomarkers and randomized control trials, have suggested the presence of neuroinflammation in schizophrenia. Many studies have also measured markers of neuroinflammation in postmortem brain samples from schizophrenia patients. The objective of this study was to conduct a systematic search of the literature on neuroinflammation in postmortem brains of schizophrenia patients indexed in MEDLINE, Embase and PsycINFO. Databases were searched up until 20th March 2016 for articles published on postmortem brains in schizophrenia evaluating microglia, astrocytes, glia, cytokines, the arachidonic cascade, substance P and other markers of neuroinflammation. Two independent reviewers extracted the data. Out of 5385 articles yielded by the search, 119 articles were identified that measured neuroinflammatory markers in schizophrenic postmortem brains. Glial fibrillary acidic protein expression was elevated, lower or unchanged in 6, 6 and 21 studies, respectively, and similar results were obtained for glial cell densities. On the other hand, microglial markers were increased, lower or unchanged in schizophrenia in 11, 3 and 8 studies, respectively. Results were variable across all other markers, but SERPINA3 and IFITM were consistently increased in 4 and 5 studies, respectively. Despite the variability, some studies evaluating neuroinflammation in postmortem brains in schizophrenia suggest an increase in microglial activity and other markers such as SERPINA3 and IFITM. Variability across studies is partially explained by multiple factors including brain region evaluated, source of the brain, diagnosis, age at time of death, age of onset and the presence of suicide victims in the cohort.

The CanPain SCI Clinical Practice Guidelines for Rehabilitation Management of Neuropathic Pain after Spinal Cord: introduction, methodology and recommendation overview	SPINAL CORD			English	Article							INJURY; ORIGINS	Study design: Clinical practice guidelines. Objectives: The objective was to develop the first Canadian clinical practice guidelines for the management of neuropathic pain in people with spinal cord injury (SCI). Setting: The guidelines are relevant for inpatient and outpatient SCI rehabilitation settings in Canada. Methods: The guidelines were developed in accordance with the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II tool. A Steering Committee and Working Group reviewed the relevant evidence on neuropathic pain management (encompassing screening and diagnosis, treatment and models of care) after SCI. The quality of evidence was scored using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE). A consensus process was followed to achieve agreement on recommendations and clinical considerations. Results: The Working Group developed 12 recommendations for screening and diagnosis, 12 recommendations for treatment and 5 recommendations for models of care. Important clinical considerations accompany each recommendation. Conclusions: The Working Group recommendations for the management of neuropathic pain after SCI should be used to inform practice.

Recovery of adrenal function after chronic secondary adrenal insufficiency in patients with hypopituitarism	CLINICAL ENDOCRINOLOGY			English	Article							NONFUNCTIONING PITUITARY-ADENOMA; INSULIN TOLERANCE-TEST; TERM-FOLLOW-UP; 250 MU-G; GLUCOCORTICOID REPLACEMENT; CORTISOL-LEVELS; SURGERY; MACROADENOMAS; ADULTS; AXIS	ObjectivePrevious studies have reported recovery of secondary adrenal insufficiency (SAI) in patients with pituitary disorders, generally immediately after pituitary surgery; however, data regarding recovery of long-term SAI are lacking. We conducted a study to assess the longer term recovery rate of SAI in patients with pituitary disorders. MethodsWe identified all SAI patients in the Halifax Neuropituitary Database from 1 November 2005 to 30 September 2014, who had required glucocorticoid therapy for 3 months, and had a minimum follow-up of 6 months. Patients with ACTH-secreting adenomas, those receiving glucocorticoids only in the routine peri-operative period for pituitary surgery and those on glucocorticoids for nonpituitary conditions were excluded. SAI was defined as either basal serum cortisol < 130 nm and/or a subnormal cortisol response to ACTH-(1-24) stimulation test or insulin tolerance test response. ResultsFifty-one patients fulfilled the criteria. Nine (176%) patients had complete recovery of SAI over a median of 20 months (range: 8-51) after initiating glucocorticoid replacement. Patients with smaller tumour size had increased likelihood of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis recovery, whereas those with secondary hypogonadism or growth hormone deficiency were less likely to recover. Those with initial cortisol >175 nm had an almost one in two chance of recovery. ConclusionResults from our study show that approximately one in six patients with SAI recover adrenal function, even up to 5 years after diagnosis. We recommend that patients with SAI undergo regular testing to assess recovery in order to prevent unnecessary glucocorticoid therapy.	[Munro, V.; Tugwell, B.; Clarke, D. B.; Imran, S.

Gain-of-Function Mutations in RARB Cause Intellectual Disability with Progressive Motor Impairment	HUMAN MUTATION			English	Article						retinoic acid; RARB; gain-of-function; movement disorder; developmental delay; intellectual disability	RETINOIC ACID RECEPTOR; DIFFERENTIAL EXPRESSION; MOUSE FETUSES; BETA; ABNORMALITIES; MECHANISMS; DIAGNOSIS; STRIATUM; CRANIOSYNOSTOSIS; GAMMA	Retinoic acid (RA) signaling plays a key role in the development and function of several systems in mammals. We previously discovered that the de novo mutations c.1159C>T (p.Arg387Cys) and c.1159C>A (p.Arg387Ser) in the RA Receptor Beta (RARB) gene cause microphthalmia and diaphragmatic hernia. However, the natural history of affected subjects beyond the prenatal or neonatal period was unknown. Here, we describe nine additional subjects with microphthalmia who have de novo mutations in RARB, including the previously described p.Arg387Cys as well as the novel c.887G>C (p.Gly296Ala) and c.638T>C (p.Leu213Pro). Moreover, we review the information on four previously reported cases. All subjects who survived the neonatal period (n = 10) displayed severe global developmental delay with progressive motor impairment due to spasticity and/or dystonia (with or without chorea). The majority of subjects also showed Chiari type I malformation and severe feeding difficulties. We previously found that p.Arg387Cys and p.Arg387Ser induce a gain-of-function. We show here that the p.Gly296Ala and p.Leu213Pro RARB mutations further promote the RA ligand-induced transcriptional activity by twofold to threefold over the wild-type receptor, also indicating a gain-of-function mechanism. These observations suggest that precise regulation of RA signaling is required for brain development and/or function in humans.

Uremic serum contains factors, such as parathyroid hormone (PTH), that decrease liver P450s. The P450s are also involved in the metabolism of xenobiotics in the brain. This study investigates: 1) the effects of CRF on rat brain P450, 2) the role of PTH in the downregulation of brain P450s in CRF rats, and 3) the effects of PTH on P450s in astrocytes. Protein and mRNA expression of P450s were assessed in the brain of CRF and control (CTL) rats, as well as from CTL or CRF rats that underwent parathyroidectomy (PTX) 1 week before nephrectomy. CYP3A activity was measured using 3-[(3, 4-difluorobenzyl) oxy]-5, 5-dimethyl-4-[4-methylsulfonyl) phenyl] furan-2(5H)-1 metabolism in brain microsomal preparation. CYP3A protein expression was assessed in primary cultured astrocytes incubated with serum obtained from CRF or CTL rats or with PTH. Significant downregulations (>= 40%) of CYP1A, CYP2C11, and CYP3A proteins were observed in microsomes from CRF rat brains. CYP3A activity reduction was also observed. CYP3A expression and activity were unaffected in PTX-pretreated CRF rats. Serum of PTX-treated CRF rats had no impact on CYP3A levels in astrocytes compared with that of untreated CRF rats. Finally, PTH addition to normal calf serum induced a reduction in CYP3A protein similar to CRF serum, suggesting that CRF-induced hyperparathyroidism is associated with a significant decrease in P450 drug-metabolizing enzymes in the brain, which may have implications in drug response.

J	Mathias, B; Tillmann, B; Palmer, C				Mathias, Brian; Tillmann, Barbara; Palmer, Caroline			Sensory, Cognitive, and Sensorimotor Learning Effects in Recognition Memory for Music	JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							EXPECTANCY VIOLATION; AUDITORY-PERCEPTION; BRAIN RESPONSES; PREMOTOR CORTEX; POTENTIAL ERP; PARIETAL LOBE; PERFORMANCE; SYSTEM; REPRESENTATIONS; EXPECTATIONS	Recent research suggests that perception and action are strongly interrelated and that motor experience may aid memory recognition. We investigated the role of motor experience in auditory memory recognition processes by musicians using behavioral, ERP, and neural source current density measures. Skilled pianists learned one set of novel melodies by producing them and another set by perception only. Pianists then completed an auditory memory recognition test during which the previously learned melodies were presented with or without an out-of-key pitch alteration while the EEG was recorded. Pianists indicated whether each melody was altered from or identical to one of the original melodies. Altered pitches elicited a larger N2 ERP component than original pitches, and pitches within previously produced melodies elicited a larger N2 than pitches in previously perceived melodies. Cortical motor planning regions were more strongly activated within the time frame of the N2 following altered pitches in previously produced melodies compared with previously perceived melodies, and larger N2 amplitudes were associated with greater detection accuracy following production learning than perception learning. Early sensory (N1) and later cognitive (P3a) components elicited by pitch alterations correlated with predictions of sensory echoic and schematic tonality models, respectively, but only for the perception learning condition, suggesting that production experience alters the extent to which performers rely on sensory and tonal recognition cues. These findings provide evidence for distinct time courses of sensory, schematic, and motoric influences within the same recognition task and suggest that learned auditory-motor associations influence responses to out-of-key pitches.

Identifying cell type-specific mechanisms will help to appropriately target interventions for tissue repair. Arginase-1 (Arg-1) is a well characterised modulator of tissue repair and its expression correlates with recovery after CNS injury. Here we assessed the cellular localisation of Arg-1 in two models of CNS damage. Using microglia specific antibodies, P2ry12 and Fc receptor-like S (FCRLS), we show the LysM-EGFP reporter mouse is an excellent model to distinguish infiltrating myeloid cells from resident microglia. We show that Arg-1 is expressed exclusively in infiltrating myeloid cells but not microglia in models of spinal cord injury (SCI) and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Our in vitro studies suggest that factors in the CNS environment prevent expression of Arg-1 in microglia in vivo. This work suggests different functional roles for these cells in CNS injury and repair and shows that such repair pathways can be switched on in infiltrating myeloid cells in pro-inflammatory environments.

CURRENT OPINION IN ANESTHESIOLOGY			English	Review						neostigmine; neuromuscular block; residual paralysis; sugammadex	INDUCED NEUROMUSCULAR BLOCKADE; IMPROVES SURGICAL CONDITIONS; POSTANESTHESIA CARE-UNIT; MORBIDLY OBESE-PATIENTS; LAPAROSCOPIC SURGERY; VENTILATE SITUATION; CONTROLLED-TRIAL; REVERSAL; ROCURONIUM; DIAPHRAGM	Purpose of review Sugammadex is a selective relaxant-binding agent that is designed to encapsulate rocuronium and chemically similar steroidal muscle relaxants such as vecuronium. This review summarizes recent information on the use of sugammadex in clinical practice. Recent findings The main advantages of sugammadex when compared with conventional anticholinesterase agents are a much faster recovery time and its unique ability to reverse rapidly and efficiently, for the first time, deep levels of neuromuscular blockade. However, there is paucity of evidence-based studies on the benefit of deep neuromuscular block, and then routine administration of sugammadex to reverse any level of block, for example, during laparoscopic surgery. It appears that reduction of costs depends mainly on organizational factors. Finally it must be remembered that sugammadex only works with steroidal nondepolarizing muscle relaxants; therefore neostigmine should not be withdrawn because it is the only reversal agent effective against atracurium or cisatracurium. Summary Sugammadex offers a significantly faster and more predictable recovery profile than neostigmine. It is now possible to reverse rapidly and efficiently any level of neuromuscular blockade and to avoid the risk of adverse events because of residual paralysis such as critical respiratory events during recovery from anesthesia.

The developmental relationship between DHEA and visual attention is mediated by structural plasticity of cortico-amygdalar networks	PSYCHONEUROENDOCRINOLOGY			English	Article						Adrenarche; Androgen; Visual awareness; Visuo-motor dexterity; Adolescents; Human brain	DEFICIT HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; AGE-RELATED-CHANGES; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; SALIVARY TESTOSTERONE; NEUROACTIVE STEROIDS; SUSTAINED ATTENTION; EMOTION REGULATION; BRAIN-DEVELOPMENT; DEHYDROEPIANDROSTERONE; SCHIZOPHRENIA	Humans and the great apes are the only species demonstrated to exhibit adrenarche, a key developmental event leading to increased production of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), suggesting that this hormone may play an important evolutionary role. Similarly, visual attention networks have been shown to evolve in a human-specific manner, with some anatomical connections and elements of cortical organization exclusive to our species. Existing studies of human brain development support the notion that DHEA shows significant uptake in cortical structures and the amygdala, and as such, could be involved in the bottom-up regulation of visual attention. Here we examined associations between DHEA, structural covariance of the amygdala with whole-brain cortical thickness, and tests of visual attention, in a longitudinal sample of typically developing children and adolescents 6-22 years of age. We found that DHEA predicted covariance between amygdalar volume and the left occipital pole, right somatosensory parietal cortex and right anterior cingulate cortex. Amygdala-occipital covariance predicted visual awareness; amygdala-parietal covariance predicted visuo-motor dexterity and processing speed; amygdala-prefrontal covariance predicted global attentional impairment. Further, effects of DHEA were above and beyond those of age and sex, as well as distinct from those of pubertal stage, estradiol and testosterone. These findings support the notion that DHEA may play a unique role in shaping amygdala-dependent cortical plasticity and in regulating 'bottom-up' visual attention processes from childhood to young adulthood.

We put forth a single and a multichannel system applying a Minimum Euclidean or Manhattan Distance Cluster-based (MDC) deterministic compressed sensing matrix. The single-channel signal processing system is composed of spike detection and data compression blocks. For the construction of the MDC matrix, the distance sigma is an important parameter, which can take a value of 4 or 5. In addition, the sharing strategy is used to construct a multichannel system, and we analyze the influence of the number of the channels; scan rate on the reconstruction error, compression rate and power consumption; the influence of the signal-to-noise ratio; and reconstruction performance on neural signals. Based on the results, a 256-channel digital signal processing system, implemented in a 130-nm CMOS process, is proposed. This system has power consumption per channel of 12.5 IsW and silicon area per channel of 0.03 mm(2), and provides data reduction of around 90% while enabling accurate reconstruction of the original signals.

To better inform the clinical physiology of the dying process and organ donation practices, we performed a scoping review of the literature to assess time to loss of brain function and activity after circulatory arrest. Materials and methods: Medline and Embase databases were searched from inception to June 2014 for articles reporting the time interval to loss of brain function or activity after loss of systemic circulation. Results: Thirty-nine studies met selection criteria. Seven human studies and 10 animal studies reported that electroencephalography (EEG) activity is lost less than 30 seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest. In the setting of existing brain injury, with progressive loss of oxygenated circulation, loss of EEG may occur before circulatory arrest. Cortical evoked potentials may persist for several minutes after loss of circulation. Conclusion: The time required to lose brain function varied according to clinical context and method by which this function is measured. Most studies show that clinical loss of consciousness and loss of EEG activity occur within 30 seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest and may occur before circulatory arrest after progressive hypoxia-ischemia. Prospective clinical studies are required to confirm these observations. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Synthesis of recurrent neural networks for dynamical system simulation	NEURAL NETWORKS			English	Article						Recurrent neural network; Dynamical system; Approximation; Attractor; Chaos; Nonautonomous system	TIME	We review several of the most widely used techniques for training recurrent neural networks to approximate dynamical systems, then describe a novel algorithm for this task. The algorithm is based on an earlier theoretical result that guarantees the quality of the network approximation. We show that a feed-forward neural network can be trained on the vector-field representation of a given dynamical system using backpropagation, then recast it as a recurrent network that replicates the original system's dynamics. After detailing this algorithm and its relation to earlier approaches, we present numerical examples that demonstrate its capabilities. One of the distinguishing features of our approach is that both the original dynamical systems and the recurrent networks that simulate them operate in continuous time. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Longitudinal Changes in Depressive Circuitry in Response to Neuromodulation Therapy	Frontiers in Neural Circuits			English	Article						repetitivetranscranialmagneticstimulation (rTMS); neuromodulation; dorsolateralprefrontalcortex (DLPFC); depression; deepbrainstimulation (DBS); functionalconnectivity	TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; DEEP BRAIN-STIMULATION; DORSOLATERAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; TREATMENT-RESISTANT DEPRESSION; EPIDURAL CORTICAL STIMULATION; STATE FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; RESTING-STATE; SUBGENUAL CINGULATE; MAJOR DEPRESSION; NEURAL CIRCUITS	BACKGROUND: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a public health problem worldwide. There is increasing interest in using non-invasive therapies such as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to treat MDD. However, the changes induced by rTMS on neural circuits remain poorly characterized. The present study aims to test whether the brain regions previously targeted by deep brain stimulation (DBS) in the treatment of MDD respond to rTMS, and whether functional connectivity (FC) measures can predict clinical response. METHODS: rTMS (20 sessions) was administered to five MDD patients at the left-dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (L-DLPFC) over 4 weeks. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings and Montgomery-Asberg depression rating scale (MADRS) assessments were acquired before, during and after treatment. Our primary measures, obtained with MEG source imaging, were changes in power spectral density (PSD) and changes in FC as measured using coherence. RESULTS: Of the five patients, four met the clinical response criterion (40% or greater decrease in MADRS) after 4 weeks of treatment. An increase in gamma power at the L-DLPFC was correlated with improvement in symptoms. We also found that increases in delta band connectivity between L-DLPFC/amygdala and L-DLPFC/pregenual anterior cingulate cortex (pACC), and decreases in gamma band connectivity between L-DLPFC/subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sACC), were correlated with improvements in depressive symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that non-invasive intervention techniques, such as rTMS, modulate the ongoing activity of depressive circuits targeted for DBS, and that MEG can capture these changes. Gamma oscillations may originate from GABA-mediated inhibition, which increases synchronization of large neuronal populations, possibly leading to increased long-range FC. We postulate that responses to rTMS could provide valuable insights into early evaluation of patient candidates for DBS surgery.

Its diverse functionality is segregated along the septotemporal axis from the dorsal to ventral hippocampus. However, features distinguishing immature neurons in these regions have yet to be characterized. Additionally, although we have shown that administration of the neurotrophic factor neuregulin-1 (NRG1) selectively increases proliferation and overall neurogenesis in the mouse ventral dentate gyrus (DG), likely through ErbB3, NRG1's effects on intermediate neurogenic stages in immature neurons are unknown. We examined whether NRG1 administration increases DG ErbB3 phosphorylation. We labeled adultborn cells using BrdU, then administered NRG1 to examine in vivo neurogenic effects on immature neurons with respect to cell survival, morphology, and synaptogenesis. We also characterized features of immature neurons along the septotemporal axis. We found that neurogenic effects of NRG1 are temporally and subregionally specific to proliferation in the ventral DG. Particular morphological features differentiate immature neurons in the dorsal and ventral DG, and cytogenesis differed between these regions. Finally, we identified synaptic heterogeneity surrounding the granule cell layer. These results indicate neurogenic involvement of NRG1-induced antidepressant-like behaviour is particularly associated with increased ventral DG cell proliferation, and identify novel distinctions between dorsal and ventral hippocampal neurogenic development.

CAHHM Study Investigators	Rationale, design, and methods for Canadian alliance for healthy hearts and minds cohort study (CAHHM) - a Pan Canadian cohort study	BMC PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article							MONTREAL COGNITIVE ASSESSMENT; FATTY LIVER-DISEASE; MENTAL-STATE-EXAMINATION; CARDIOMETABOLIC RISK-FACTORS; CARDIAC MAGNETIC-RESONANCE; VISCERAL ADIPOSE-TISSUE; PERICARDIAL FAT; ASSESSMENT MOCA; CARDIOVASCULAR-DISEASE; OLDER-ADULTS	Background: The Canadian Alliance for Healthy Hearts and Minds (CAHHM) is a pan-Canadian, prospective, multi-ethnic cohort study being conducted in Canada. The overarching objective of the CAHHM is to understand the association of socio-environmental and contextual factors (such as societal structure, activity, nutrition, social and tobacco environments, and access to health services) with cardiovascular risk factors, subclinical vascular disease, and cardiovascular and other chronic disease outcomes. Methods/Design: Participants between 35 and 69 years of age are being recruited from existing cohorts and a new First Nations Cohort to undergo a detailed assessment of health behaviours (including diet and physical activity), cognitive function, assessment of their local home and workplace environments, and their health services access and utilization. Physical measures including weight, height, waist/hip circumference, body fat percentage, and blood pressure are collected. In addition, eligible participants undergo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain, heart, carotid artery and abdomen to detect early subclinical vascular disease and ectopic fat deposition. Discussion: CAHHM is a prospective cohort study designed to investigate the impact of community level factors, individual health behaviours, and access to health services, on cognitive function, subclinical vascular disease, fat distribution, and the development of chronic diseases among adults living in Canada.

PREDICT Sunnybrook ICH CTA Study	Ultraearly hematoma growth in active intracerebral hemorrhage	NEUROLOGY			English	Article							ANGIOGRAPHY SPOT SIGN; BLOOD-PRESSURE; EXPANSION; ENLARGEMENT; PREVALENCE	Objective:To determine the association of ultraearly hematoma growth (uHG) with the CT angiography (CTA) spot sign, hematoma expansion, and clinical outcomes in patients with acute intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH).Methods:We analyzed data from 231 patients enrolled in the multicenter Predicting Haematoma Growth and Outcome in Intracerebral Haemorrhage Using Contrast Bolus CT study. uHG was defined as baseline ICH volume/onset-to-CT time (mL/h). The spot sign was used as marker of active hemorrhage. Outcome parameters included significant hematoma expansion (>33% or >6 mL, primary outcome), rate of hematoma expansion, early neurologic deterioration, 90-day mortality, and poor outcome.Results:uHG was higher in spot sign patients (p < 0.001) and in patients scanned earlier (p < 0.001). Both uHG >4.7 mL/h (p = 0.002) and the CTA spot sign (p = 0.030) showed effects on rate of hematoma expansion but not its interaction (2-way analysis of variance, p = 0.477). uHG >4.7 mL/h improved the sensitivity of the spot sign in the prediction of significant hematoma expansion (73.9% vs 46.4%), early neurologic deterioration (67.6% vs 35.3%), 90-day mortality (81.6% vs 44.9%), and poor outcome (72.8% vs 29.8%), respectively. uHG was independently related to significant hematoma expansion (odds ratio 1.06, 95% confidence interval 1.03-1.10) and clinical outcomes.Conclusions:uHG is a useful predictor of hematoma expansion and poor clinical outcomes in patients with acute ICH. The combination of high uHG and the spot sign is associated with a higher rate of hematoma expansion, highlighting the need for very fast treatment in ICH patients.

Cultural Affordances: Scaffolding Local Worlds Through Shared Intentionally and Regimes of Attention	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						affordances (ecological psychology); cultural affordances; radical embodied cognition; enactive cognitive neuroscience; free-energy principle; predictive processing; regimes of attention; cognitive anthropology	FREE-ENERGY PRINCIPLE; NATURAL ORIGINS; SOCIAL AFFORDANCES; ENACTIVE APPROACH; ACTIVE INFERENCE; HUMAN COGNITION; VISUAL-CORTEX; BRAIN; SYSTEMS; REPRESENTATIONS	In this paper we outline a framework for the study of the mechanisms involved in the engagement of human agents with cultural affordances. Our aim is to better understand how culture and context interact with human biology to shape human behavior, cognition, and experience. We attempt to integrate several related approaches in the study of the embodied, cognitive, and affective substrates of sociality and culture and the sociocultural scaffolding of experience. The integrative framework we propose bridges cognitive and social sciences to provide (i) an expanded concept of 'affordance' that extends to sociocultural forms of life, and (ii) a multilevel account of the socioculturally scaffolded forms of affordance learning and the transmission of affordances in patterned sociocultural practices and regimes of shared attention. This framework provides an account of how cultural content and normative practices are built on a foundation of contentless basic mental processes that acquire content through immersive participation of the agent in social practices that regulate joint attention and shared intentionality.

The evolutionary scope and neurological disease linkage of yeast-prion-like proteins in humans	BIOLOGY DIRECT			English	Article						Prion; Amyloid; Yeast; Human; Disease; Neurodegenerative; Poly-Q expansion; Evolution; Glutamine; Asparagine	COMPOSITIONAL BIAS; GENETIC-VARIATION; DOMAINS; REGIONS; TDP-43; AGGREGATION; PREDICTION; DROSOPHILA; SEQUENCES; SOD1	Background: Prions are proteinaceous particles that propagate alternative protein conformations/states to further copies of the same proteins, and are transmitted from cell-to-cell, and organism-to-organism. Prions are usually made of the beta-sheet rich assemblies termed amyloid. The original prion protein PrP causes devastating neurodegenerative disorders in humans and other mammals. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, many prion-forming proteins have been observed; a prominent feature of these proteins is an intrinsically disordered domain rich in glutamine (Q) and asparagine (N) residues. Several human proteins that are yeast-prion-like, in particular those with poly-glutamine (poly-Q) expansions, have been experimentally implicated in human neurodegenerative diseases. Results: Here, we have constructed a comprehensive list of human yeast-prion-like proteins that are linked to human neurological disease. Surprisingly, different methods to annotate yeast-prion-like proteins in humans have limited intersection. However, independent of annotation method, we find that human yeast-prion-like proteins as a group have a statistically significant genetic linkage to neurological disease, that is caused specifically by linkage to neurodegenerative diseases. This is despite: (i) no especially high expression of yeast-prion-like proteins in the central nervous system, or (ii) no general enrichment of intrinsically disordered proteins in neurological/neurodegenerative diseases. Cytoskeletal proteins are significantly overrepresented in the set of human yeast-prion-like neurological proteins. Whether involved in neurological pathomechanisms or not, yeast-prion-like proteins in humans have very limited conservation outside of Deuterostomia (< similar to 10 %) with only a handful having prion-like character in both human and S. cerevisiae. The only such protein with a disease linkage is PUB1/TIA1, which functions as a stress granule component. Thus, the yeast-prion-like character of proteins linked to neurodegenerative diseases has not been conserved over the deep evolutionary time since the last common ancestor of yeasts and humans. Conclusion: Our results provide a comprehensive picture of yeast-prion-like proteins in humans and contribute to the strategic basis for experimental investigation of the link between yeast-prion-like protein character and neurological disease.

Effect of Radiosurgery Alone vs Radiosurgery With Whole Brain Radiation Therapy on Cognitive Function in Patients With 1 to 3 Brain Metastases A Randomized Clinical Trial	JAMA-JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION			English	Article							QUALITY-OF-LIFE; PHASE-III TRIAL; NEUROCOGNITIVE FUNCTION; STEREOTACTIC RADIOSURGERY; SURGICAL RESECTION; RADIOTHERAPY; CANCER; TUMORS	IMPORTANCE Whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) significantly improves tumor control in the brain after stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), yet because of its association with cognitive decline, its role in the treatment of patients with brain metastases remains controversial. OBJECTIVE To determine whether there is less cognitive deterioration at 3 months after SRS alone vs SRS plus WBRT. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS At 34 institutions in North America, patients with 1 to 3 brain metastases were randomized to receive SRS or SRS plus WBRT between February 2002 and December 2013. INTERVENTIONS The WBRT dose schedule was 30 Gy in 12 fractions; the SRS dose was 18 to 22 Gy in the SRS plus WBRT group and 20 to 24 Gy for SRS alone. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary end pointwas cognitive deterioration (decline >1 SD from baseline on at least 1 cognitive test at 3 months) in participants who completed the baseline and 3-month assessments. Secondary end points included time to intracranial failure, quality of life, functional independence, long-term cognitive status, and overall survival. RESULTS There were 213 randomized participants (SRS alone, n=111; SRS plus WBRT, n=102) with a mean age of 60.6 years (SD, 10.5 years); 103 (48%) were women. There was less cognitive deterioration at 3 months after SRS alone (40/63 patients [63.5%]) than when combined with WBRT (44/48 patients [91.7%]; difference, -28.2%; 90% CI, -41.9% to -14.4%; P<.001). Quality of life was higher at 3 months with SRS alone, including overall quality of life (mean change from baseline, -0.1 vs -12.0 points; mean difference, 11.9; 95% CI, 4.8-19.0 points; P=.001). Time to intracranial failure was significantly shorter for SRS alone compared with SRS plus WBRT (hazard ratio, 3.6; 95% CI, 2.2-5.9; P<.001). There was no significant difference in functional independence at 3 months between the treatment groups (mean change from baseline, -1.5 points for SRS alone vs -4.2 points for SRS plus WBRT; mean difference, 2.7 points; 95% CI, -2.0 to 7.4 points; P=.26). Median overall survival was 10.4 months for SRS alone and 7.4 months for SRS plus WBRT (hazard ratio, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.75-1.38; P=.92). For long-term survivors, the incidence of cognitive deterioration was less after SRS alone at 3 months (5/11 [45.5%] vs 16/17 [94.1%]; difference, -48.7%; 95% CI, -87.6% to -9.7%; P=.007) and at 12 months (6/10 [60%] vs 17/18 [94.4%]; difference, -34.4%; 95% CI, -74.4% to 5.5%; P=.04). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among patients with 1 to 3 brain metastases, the use of SRS alone, compared with SRS combined with WBRT, resulted in less cognitive deterioration at 3 months. In the absence of a difference in overall survival, these findings suggest that for patients with 1 to 3 brainmetastases amenable to radiosurgery, SRS alone may be a preferred strategy.

Strikingly, inactivation of Lmx1a and Lmx1b recreates cellular features observed in Parkinson's disease. We found that Lmx1a/b control the expression of key genes involved in mitochondrial functions, and their ablation results in impaired respiratory chain activity, increased oxidative stress, and mitochondrial DNA damage. Lmx1a/b deficiency caused axonal pathology characterized by alpha-synuclein(+) inclusions, followed by a progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons. These results reveal the key role of these transcription factors beyond the early developmental stages and provide mechanistic links between mitochondrial dysfunctions, alpha-synuclein aggregation, and the survival of dopaminergic neurons.

Reliable tools are needed to screen parental distress over the cancer trajectory. This study aimed to estimate the stability and repeatability of the Distress Thermometer (DT) and the Depression and Anxiety items of the Edmonton Symptom Assessment System-revised (ESAS-r-D; -A) in parents of children diagnosed with cancer. Methods Fifty parents (28 mothers, median age = 44) of clinically stable survivors of childhood solid and brain tumours completed questionnaires about their own distress (DT, ESAS-r-D; -A, Brief Symptom Inventory-18: BSI-18, Patient Health Questionnaire-9: PHQ-9, Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7: GAD-7) and their children's quality of life (QoL; Peds Quality of Life: PedsQL) twice, with a month interval between the two assessments. At retest, parents also evaluated life events that occurred between the two time points. Hierarchical regressions explored moderators for the temporal stability of test measures. Results Stability estimates were ICC = .78 for the DT,.55 for the ESAS-r-D, and.47 for the ESAS-rA. Caseness agreement between test and retest was substantial for the DT, fair for the ESAS-r-D, and slight for the ESAS-r-A. Repeatability analyses indicated that the error range for the DT was more than 2 pts below/above actual measurement, whereas it was more than 3 pts for the ESAS-r-A, and 2.5 for the ESAS-r-D. Instability of the DT could be explained by changes in children's physical QoL, but not by other components of QoL or life events. No moderators of stability could be identified for the ESAS-r items. Conclusions The DT appears to be a fairly stable measure when the respondent's condition is stable yet with a relatively wide error range. Fluctuations in distress-related constructs may affect the temporal stability of the DT. The lower stability of ESAS-r items may result from shorter time-lapse instructions resulting in a greater sensitivity to change. Findings support future research on the DT as a reliable instrument in caregivers.

High intensity exercise is not always a viable option for many patient groups or in a rehabilitation setting where low to moderate intensities may be more suitable. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of intensity in mediating the effects of acute cardiovascular exercise on motor skill learning. We investigated the effects of different exercise intensities on the retention (performance score) of a visuomotor accuracy tracking task. Thirty six healthy male subjects were randomly assigned to one of three groups that performed either a single bout of aerobic exercise at 20 min post motor skill learning at 45% (EX45), 90% (EX90) maximal power output (W-max) or rested (CON). Randomization was stratified to ensure that the groups were matched for relative peak oxygen consumption (ml O-2/min/kg) and baseline score in the tracking task. Retention tests were carried out at 1 (R1) and 7 days (R7) post motor skill learning. At R1, changes in performance scores were greater for EX90 compared to CON (p<0.001) and EX45 (p = 0.011). The EX45 and EX90 groups demonstrated a greater change in performance score at R7 compared to the CON group (p = 0.003 and p<0.001, respectively). The change in performance score for EX90 at R7 was also greater than EX45 (p = 0.049). We suggest that exercise intensity plays an important role in modulating the effects that a single bout of cardiovascular exercise has on the consolidation phase following motor skill learning. There appears to be a dose-response relationship in favour of higher intensity exercise in order to augment off-line effects and strengthen procedural memory.

Potential Benefit of the Charge-Stabilized Nanostructure Saline RNS60 for Myelin Maintenance and Repair	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							MULTIPLE-SCLEROSIS LESIONS; OLIGODENDROCYTES; CELLS; INJURY; BRAIN; DIFFERENTIATION; SUSCEPTIBILITY; REMYELINATION; CULTURES; HYPOXIA	Myelin injury in multiple sclerosis (MS) has been attributed both to "outside-in" primary immune mediated and "inside-out" metabolic stress of oligodendrocyte (OL) related mechanisms. Subsequent remyelination is dependent on recruitment and differentiation of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs). RNS60 is a physically-modified saline containing charge-stabilized nanobubbles generated by subjecting normal saline to Taylor-Couette-Poiseuille (TCP) flow under elevated oxygen pressure. Administration of RNS60 has been shown to reduce the severity of EAE by dampening the immune response and myelin loss. Additionally, RNS60 has been demonstrated to enhance mitochondrial ATP synthesis in neurons. Here, we used post-natal rat derived OLs and OPCs to assess the impact of RNS60 on the response of OLs to metabolic stress in vitro (glucose-nutrient deprivation, referred to as 'NG') and on OPC differentiation capacity. Under the NG condition, our findings indicate that RNS60 decreases caspases 3/7 activation. Respirometric analyses revealed that RNS60 increased spare glycolytic capacity (SGC) under normal culture conditions. However, RNS60 enhanced OL spare respiratory capacity (SRC) when a metabolic stress was present. Furthermore, we show that RNS60 promotes OPC differentiation under physiological conditions. Our findings provide evidence for the potential therapeutic efficacy of RNS60 through the promotion of OL survival and OPC differentiation.	[Rao, Vijayaraghava T.

Recent studies revealed that germ-line and somatic RIT1 mutations can cause Noonan syndrome (NS), and drive proliferation of lung adenocarcinomas, respectively, akin to RAS mutations in these diseases. However, the locations of these RIT1 mutations differ significantly from those found in RAS, and do not affect the three mutational "hot spots" of RAS. Moreover, few studies have characterized the GTPase cycle of RIT1 and its disease-associated mutants. Here we developed a real-time NMR-based GTPase assay for RIT1 and investigated the effect of disease-associated mutations on GTPase cycle. RIT1 exhibits an intrinsic GTP hydrolysis rate similar to that of H-RAS, but its intrinsic nucleotide exchange rate is similar to 4-fold faster, likely as a result of divergent residues near the nucleotide binding site. All of the disease-associated mutations investigated increased the GTP-loaded, activated state of RIT1 in vitro, but they could be classified into two groups with different intrinsic GTPase properties. The S35T, A57G, and Y89H mutants exhibited more rapid nucleotide exchange, whereas F82V and T83P impaired GTP hydrolysis. A RAS-binding domain pulldown assay indicated that RIT1 A57G and Y89H were highly activated in HEK293T cells, whereas T83P and F82V exhibited more modest activation. All five mutations are associated with NS, whereas two (A57G and F82V) have also been identified in urinary tract cancers and myeloid malignancies. Characterization of the effects on the GTPase cycle of RIT1 disease-associated mutations should enable better understanding of their role in disease processes.

Erythropoietin (EPO) was recently suggested as a potential adjunctive treatment for CM. However diverging results were obtained in patients from Sub-Saharan countries infected with P. falciparum. In this study, we measured EPO levels in the plasma of well-defined groups of P. falciparum-infected patients, from the state of Odisha in India, with mild malaria (MM), CM, or severe non-CM (NCM). EPO levels were then correlated with biological parameters, including parasite biomass, heme, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-10, interferon gamma-induced protein (IP)-10, and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 plasma concentrations by Spearman's rank and multiple correlation analyses. We found a significant increase in EPO levels with malaria severity degree, and more specifically during fatal CM. In addition, EPO levels were also found correlated positively with heme, TNF-alpha, IL-10, IP-10 and MCP-1 during CM. We also found a significant multivariate correlation between EPO, TNF-alpha, IL-10, IP-10 MCP-1 and heme, suggesting an association of EPO with a network of immune factors in CM patients. The contradictory levels of circulating EPO reported in CM patients in India when compared to Africa highlights the need for the optimization of adjunctive treatments according to the targeted population.

J	Watson, M; Sawan, M; Dancause, N				Watson, Meghan; Sawan, Mohamad; Dancause, Numa			The Duration of Motor Responses Evoked with Intracortical Microstimulation in Rats Is Primarily Modulated by Stimulus Amplitude and Train Duration	PLOS ONE			English	Article							DEEP-BRAIN-STIMULATION; CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; PYRAMIDAL TRACT CELLS; ELECTRICAL-STIMULATION; VISUAL-CORTEX; COMPLEX MOVEMENTS; PARKINSON-DISEASE; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; HIGH-FREQUENCY; NEURONS	Microstimulation of brain tissue plays a key role in a variety of sensory prosthetics, clinical therapies and research applications, however the effects of stimulation parameters on the responses they evoke remain widely unknown. In particular, the effects of parameters when delivered in the form of a stimulus train as opposed to a single pulse are not well understood despite the prevalence of stimulus train use. We aimed to investigate the contribution of each parameter of a stimulus train to the duration of the motor responses they evoke in forelimb muscles. We used constant-current, biphasic, square wave pulse trains in acute terminal experiments under ketamine anaesthesia. Stimulation parameters were systematically tested in a pair-wise fashion in the caudal forelimb region of the motor cortex in 7 Sprague-Dawley rats while motor evoked potential (MEP) recordings from the forelimb were used to quantify the influence of each parameter in the train. Stimulus amplitude and train duration were shown to be the dominant parameters responsible for increasing the total duration of the MEP, while interphase interval had no effect. Increasing stimulus frequency from 100200 Hz or pulse duration from 0.18-0.34 ms were also effective methods of extending response durations. Response duration was strongly correlated with peak time and amplitude. Our findings suggest that motor cortex intracortical microstimulations are often conducted at a higher frequency rate and longer train duration than necessary to evoke maximal response duration. We demonstrated that the temporal properties of the evoked response can be both predicted by certain response metrics and modulated via alterations to the stimulation signal parameters.

Therapeutic Impact of Cytoreductive Surgery and Irradiation of Posterior Fossa Ependymoma in the Molecular Era: A Retrospective Multicohort Analysis	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ONCOLOGY			English	Article							CONFORMAL RADIATION-THERAPY; NEWLY-DIAGNOSED EPENDYMOMA; PHASE-II TRIAL; BRAIN-TUMORS; PEDIATRIC-PATIENTS; CRANIAL RADIATION; CHILDREN; CHILDHOOD; CHEMOTHERAPY; AGE	PurposePosterior fossa ependymoma comprises two distinct molecular variants termed EPN_PFA and EPN_PFB that have a distinct biology and natural history. The therapeutic value of cytoreductive surgery and radiation therapy for posterior fossa ependymoma after accounting for molecular subgroup is not known.MethodsFour independent nonoverlapping retrospective cohorts of posterior fossa ependymomas (n = 820) were profiled using genome-wide methylation arrays. Risk stratification models were designed based on known clinical and newly described molecular biomarkers identified by multivariable Cox proportional hazards analyses.ResultsMolecular subgroup is a powerful independent predictor of outcome even when accounting for age or treatment regimen. Incompletely resected EPN_PFA ependymomas have a dismal prognosis, with a 5-year progression-free survival ranging from 26.1% to 56.8% across all four cohorts. Although first-line (adjuvant) radiation is clearly beneficial for completely resected EPN_PFA, a substantial proportion of patients with EPN_PFB can be cured with surgery alone, and patients with relapsed EPN_PFB can often be treated successfully with delayed external-beam irradiation.ConclusionThe most impactful biomarker for posterior fossa ependymoma is molecular subgroup affiliation, independent of other demographic or treatment variables. However, both EPN_PFA and EPN_PFB still benefit from increased extent of resection, with the survival rates being particularly poor for subtotally resected EPN_PFA, even with adjuvant radiation therapy. Patients with EPN_PFB who undergo gross total resection are at lower risk for relapse and should be considered for inclusion in a randomized clinical trial of observation alone with radiation reserved for those who experience recurrence.

Disruption of an EAAT-Mediated Chloride Channel in a Drosophila Model of Ataxia	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						astrocyte; channelopathy; Drosophila; EAAT; episodic ataxia	GLUTAMATE TRANSPORTER EAAT1; EPISODIC ATAXIA; IMAGE-ANALYSIS; MUTATION; MECHANISMS; GENE	Patients with Type 6 episodic ataxia (EA6) have mutations of the excitatory amino acid transporter EAAT1 (also known as GLAST), but the underlying pathophysiological mechanism for EA6 is not known. EAAT1 is a glutamate transporter expressed by astrocytes and other glia, and it serves dual function as an anion channel. One EA6-associated mutation is a P>R substitution (EAAT1(P>R)) that in transfected cells has a reduced rate of glutamate transport and an abnormal anion conductance. We expressed this EAAT1(P>R) mutation in glial cells of Drosophila larvae and found that these larvae exhibit episodic paralysis, and their astrocytes poorly infiltrate the CNS neuropil. These defects are not seen in Eaat1-null mutants, and so they cannot be explained by loss of glutamate transport. We instead explored the role of the abnormal anion conductance of the EAAT1(P>R) mutation, and to do this we expressed chloride cotransporters in astrocytes. Like the EAAT1(P>R) mutation, the chloride-extruding K+-Cl- cotransporter KccB also caused astroglial malformation and paralysis, supporting the idea that the EAAT1(P>R) mutation causes abnormal chloride flow from CNS glia. In contrast, the Na+-K+-Cl- cotransporter Ncc69, which normally allows chloride into cells, rescued the effects of the EAAT1(P>R) mutation. Together, our results indicate that the cytopathology and episodic paralysis in our Drosophila EA6 model stem from a gain-of-function chloride channelopathy of glial cells.

The impact of hematocrit on oxygenation-sensitive cardiovascular magnetic resonance	JOURNAL OF CARDIOVASCULAR MAGNETIC RESONANCE			English	Article						Hematocrit; Hemoglobin; Hemodilution; BOLD-CMR; OS-CMR; T2*	MYOCARDIAL OXYGENATION; BLOOD OXYGENATION; BRAIN; PERFUSION; HEMODILUTION; STENOSIS; DISEASE; STRESS; IMAGES	Background: Oxygenation-sensitive (OS) Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance (CMR) is a promising utility in the diagnosis of heart disease. Contrast in OS-CMR images is generated through deoxyhemoglobin in the tissue, which is negatively correlated with the signal intensity (SI). Thus, changing hematocrit levels may be a confounder in the interpretation of OS-CMR results. We hypothesized that hemodilution confounds the observed signal intensity in OS-CMR images. Methods: Venous and arterial blood from five pigs was diluted with lactated Ringer solution in 10 % increments to 50 %. The changes in signal intensity (SI) were compared to changes in blood gases and hemoglobin concentration. We performed an OS-CMR scan in 21 healthy volunteers using vasoactive breathing stimuli at baseline, which was then repeated after rapid infusion of 1 L of lactated Ringer's solution within 5-8 min. Changes of SI were measured and compared between the hydration states. Results: The % change in SI from baseline for arterial (r = -0.67, p < 0.0001) and venous blood (r = -0.55, p = 0.002) were negatively correlated with the changes in hemoglobin (Hb). SI changes in venous blood were also associated with SO2 (r = 0.68, p < 0.0001) and deoxyHb concentration (-0.65, p < 0.0001). In healthy volunteers, rapid infusion resulted in a significant drop in the hemoglobin concentration (142.5 +/- 15.2 g/L vs. 128.8 +/- 15.2 g/L; p < 0.0001). Baseline myocardial SI increased by 3.0 +/- 5.7 % (p = 0.026) following rapid infusion, and in males there was a strong association between the change in hemoglobin concentration and % changes in SI (r = 0.82, p = 0.002). After hyperhydration, the SI response after hyperventilation was attenuated (HV, p = 0.037), as was the maximum SI increase during apnea (p = 0.012). The extent of SI attenuation was correlated with the reduction in hemoglobin concentration at the end of apnea (r = 0.55, p = 0.012) for all subjects and at maximal SI (r = 0.63, p = 0.037) and the end of breath-hold (r = 0.68, p = 0.016) for males only. Conclusion: In dynamic studies using oxygenation-sensitive CMR, the hematocrit level affects baseline signal intensity and the observed signal intensity response. Thus, the hydration status of the patient may be a confounder for OS-CMR image analysis.

However, at the label fusion stage, a majority of algorithms focus primarily on optimizing weight-maps associated with the atlas library based on a theoretical objective function that approximates the segmentation error. In contrast, we propose a novel method-Autocorrecting Walks over Localized Markov Random Fields (AWoL-MRF)-that aims at mimicking the sequential process of manual segmentation, which is the gold-standard for virtually all the segmentation methods. AWoL-MRF begins with a set of candidate labels generated by a multi-atlas segmentation pipeline as an initial label distribution and refines low confidence regions based on a localized Markov random field (L-MRF) model using a novel sequential inference process (walks). We show that AWoL-MRF produces state-of-the-art results with superior accuracy and robustness with a small atlas library compared to existing methods. We validate the proposed approach by performing hippocampal segmentations on three independent datasets: (1) Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Database (ADNI), (2) First Episode Psychosis patient cohort, and (3) A cohort of preterm neonates scanned early in life and at term equivalent age. We assess the improvement in the performance qualitatively as well as quantitatively by comparing AWoL-MRF with majority vote, STAPLE, and Joint Label Fusion methods. AWoL-MRF reaches a maximum accuracy of 0.881 (dataset 1), 0.897 (dataset 2), and 0.807 (dataset 3) based on Dice similarity coefficient metric, offering significant performance improvements with a smaller atlas library (< 10) over compared methods. We also evaluate the diagnostic utility of AWoL-MRF by analyzing the volume differences per disease category in the ADNI1: Complete Screening dataset. We have made the source code for AWoL-MRF public at: https://github.com/CobraLab/AWoL-MRF.	[Bhagwat, Nikhil; Winterburn, Julie L.; Chakravarty, M.

Model Vestibular Nuclei Neurons Can Exhibit a Boosting Nonlinearity Due to an Adaptation Current Regulated by Spike-Triggered Calcium and Calcium-Activated Potassium Channels	PLOS ONE			English	Article							DYNAMICS	In vitro studies have previously found a class of vestibular nuclei neurons to exhibit a bidirectional afterhyperpolarization (AHP) in their membrane potential, due to calcium and calcium-activated potassium conductances. More recently in vivo studies of such vestibular neurons were found to exhibit a boosting nonlinearity in their input-output tuning curves. In this paper, a Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) type neuron model, originally developed to reproduce the in vitro AHP, is shown to produce a boosting nonlinearity similar to that seen in vivo for increased the calcium conductance. Indicative of a bifurcation, the HH model is reduced to a generalized integrate-and-fire (IF) model that preserves the bifurcation structure and boosting nonlinearity. By then projecting the neuron model's phase space trajectories into 2D, the underlying geometric mechanism relating the AHP and boosting nonlinearity is revealed. Further simplifications and approximations are made to derive analytic expressions for the steady steady state firing rate as a function of bias current, mu, as well as the gain (i.e. its slope) and the position of its peak at mu = mu*. Finally, although the boosting nonlinearity has not yet been experimentally observed in vitro, testable predictions indicate how it might be found.

This mutation affects the maturation and gating of CFTR protein. The search for new high-affinity ligands of CFTR acting as dual modulators (correctors/activators) presents a major challenge in the pharmacology of cystic fibrosis. Snake venoms are a rich source of natural multifunctional proteins, potential binders of ion channels. In this study, we identified the CB subunit of crotoxin from Crotalus durissus terrificus as a new ligand and allosteric modulator of CFTR. We showed that CB interacts with NBD1 of both wild type and Delta F508CFTR and increases their chloride channel currents. The potentiating effect of CB on CFTR activity was demonstrated using electrophysiological techniques in Xenopus laevis oocytes, in CFTR HeLa cells, and ex vivo in mouse colon tissue. The correcting effect of CB was shown by functional rescue of CFTR activity after 24-h Delta F508CFTR treatments with CB. Moreover, the presence of fully glycosylated CFTR was observed. Molecular docking allowed us to propose a model of the complex involving of the ABC beta and F1-like ATP-binding subdomains of Delta F508-NBD1. Hydrogen deuterium exchange analysis confirmed stabilization in these regions, also showing allosteric stabilization in two other distal regions. Surface plasmon resonance competition studies showed that CB disrupts the Delta F508CFTR-cytokeratin 8 complex, allowing for the escape of Delta F508CFTR from degradation. Therefore CB, as a dual modulator of Delta F508CFTR, constitutes a template for the development of new anti-CF agents. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

To clarify these relationships, we analyzed genomic alterations in LCNEC compared with other major lung carcinoma types. Experimental Design: LCNEC (n = 45) tumor/normal pairs underwent targeted next-generation sequencing of 241 cancer genes by Memorial Sloan Kettering-Integrated Mutation Profiling of Actionable Cancer Targets (MSK-IMPACT) platform and comprehensive histologic, immunohistochemical, and clinical analysis. Genomic data were compared with MSK-IMPACT analysis of other lung carcinoma histologies (n = 242). Results: Commonly altered genes in LCNEC included TP53 (78%), RB1 (38%), STK11 (33%), KEAP1 (31%), and KRAS (22%). Genomic profiles segregated LCNEC into 2 major and 1 minor subsets: SCLC-like (n = 18), characterized by TP53+RB1 co-mutation/loss and other SCLC-type alterations, including MYCL amplification; NSCLC-like (n = 25), characterized by the lack of coaltered TP53+RB1 and nearly universal occurrence of NSCLC-type mutations (STK11, KRAS, and KEAP1); and carcinoid-like (n = 2), characterized by MEN1 mutations and low mutation burden. SCLC-like and NSCLC-like subsets revealed several clinicopathologic differences, including higher proliferative activity in SCLC-like tumors (P < 0.0001) and exclusive adenocarcinoma-type differentiation marker expression in NSCLC-like tumors (P = 0.005). While exhibiting predominant similarity with lung adenocarcinoma, NSCLC-like LCNEC harbored several distinctive genomic alterations, including more frequent mutations in NOTCH family genes (28%), implicated as key regulators of neuroendocrine differentiation. Conclusions: LCNEC is a biologically heterogeneous group of tumors, comprising distinct subsets with genomic signatures of SCLC, NSCLC (predominantly adenocarcinoma), and rarely, highly proliferative carcinoids. Recognition of these subsets may inform the classification and management of LCNEC patients. (C) 2016 AACR.

Microglia can play dual roles in the central nervous system; they can be deleterious and/or protective. The immunomodulatory effects of alimentary components, gut microbiota, and nanotechnological products have been investigated in microglia at the single-cell level and in vivo using intravital imaging approaches, and different biochemical assays. This review highlights some of the emerging questions and topics from studies involving alimentation, microbiota, nanotechnological products, and associated problems in this area of research.

First, domain-specific accounts are based on the assumption that these end-state symptoms result from specific impairments within component structures of the social brain network. Second, domain-general accounts hypothesize that rather than being localized, atypical brain structure and function are widespread, or hypothesize that the apparent social brain differences are the consequence of adaptations to earlier occurring widespread changes in brain function. Critical evidence for resolving this basic issue comes from prospective longitudinal studies of infants at risk for later diagnosis. We highlight selected studies from the newly emerging literature on infants at familial risk for autism to shed light on this issue. Despite multiple reports of possible alterations in brain function in the first year of life, overt behavioral symptoms do not emerge until the second year. Our review reveals only mixed support, within this very early period, for localized deficits in social brain network systems and instead favors the view that atypical development involving perceptual, attentional, motor, and social systems precede the emerging autism phenotype.

Beyond language and global cognition, neuropsychological assessments of these two CNVs have not yet been reported. METHODS: This study investigates the relationship between the number of genomic copies at the 16p11.2 locus and cognitive domains assessed in 62 deletion carriers, 44 duplication carriers, and 71 intrafamilial control subjects. RESULTS: IQ is decreased in deletion and duplication carriers, but we demonstrate contrasting cognitive profiles in these reciprocal CNVs. Deletion carriers present with severe impairments of phonology and of inhibition skills beyond what is expected for their IQ level. In contrast, for verbal memory and phonology, the data may suggest that duplication carriers outperform intrafamilial control subjects with the same IQ level. This finding is reminiscent of special isolated skills as well as contrasting language performance observed in autism spectrum disorder. Some domains, such as visuospatial and working memory, are unaffected by the 16p11.2 locus beyond the effect of decreased IQ. Neuroimaging analyses reveal that measures of inhibition covary with neuroanatomic structures previously identified as sensitive to 16p11.2 CNVs. CONCLUSIONS: The simultaneous study of reciprocal CNVs suggests that the 16p11.2 genomic locus modulates specific cognitive skills according to the number of genomic copies. Further research is warranted to replicate these findings and elucidate the molecular mechanisms modulating these cognitive performances.

IBIS Network	Development of cortical shape in the human brain from 6 to 24 months of age via a novel measure of shape complexity	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Shape complexity index; Shape index; Earth mover distance; Age effect; And sexual dimorphism	MAGNETIC-RESONANCE IMAGES; HUMAN CEREBRAL-CORTEX; LONGITUDINAL DEVELOPMENT; SPATIAL-DISTRIBUTION; HUMAN GYRIFICATION; FOLDING PATTERNS; SULCAL LANDMARKS; LIFE-SPAN; SURFACE; THICKNESS	The quantification of local surface morphology in the human cortex is important for examining population differences as well as developmental changes in neurodegenerative or neurodevelopmental disorders. We propose a novel cortical shape measure, referred to as the 'shape complexity index' (SCI), that represents localized shape complexity as the difference between the observed distributions of local surface topology, as quantified by the shape index (SI) measure, to its best fitting simple topological model within a given neighborhood. We apply a relatively small, adaptive geodesic kernel to calculate the SCI. Due to the small size of the kernel, the proposed SCI measure captures fine differences of cortical shape. With this novel cortical feature, we aim to capture comparatively small local surface changes that capture a) the widening versus deepening of sulcal and gyral regions, as well as b) the emergence and development of secondary and tertiary sulci. Current cortical shape measures, such as the gyrification index (GI) or intrinsic curvature measures, investigate the cortical surface at a different scale and are less well suited to capture these particular cortical surface changes. In our experiments, the proposed SCI demonstrates higher complexity in the gyral/sulcal wall regions, lower complexity in wider gyral ridges and lowest complexity in wider sulcal fundus regions. In early postnatal brain development, our experiments show that SCI reveals a pattern of increased cortical shape complexity with age, as well as sexual dimorphisms in the insula, middle cingulate, parieto-occipital sulcal and Broca's regions. Overall, sex differences were greatest at 6 months of age and were reduced at 24 months, with the difference pattern switching from higher complexity in males at 6 months to higher complexity in females at 24 months. This is the first study of longitudinal, cortical complexity maturation and sex differences, in the early postnatal period from 6 to 24 months of age with fine scale, cortical shape measures. These results provide information that complement previous studies of gyrification index in early brain development. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Dance and music training have different effects on white matter diffusivity in sensorimotor pathways	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Neuroplasticity; Action observation network; Sensorimotor integration; Motor training; Crossing fibres; Multiple DTI measures	SUPERIOR LONGITUDINAL FASCICULUS; ACTION OBSERVATION NETWORK; RHYTHM SYNCHRONIZATION PERFORMANCE; STRUCTURAL BRAIN-DEVELOPMENT; ANISOTROPIC WATER DIFFUSION; AXON DIAMETER DISTRIBUTION; VOXEL-BASED MORPHOMETRY; CORPUS-CALLOSUM; GRAY-MATTER; IN-VIVO	Dance and music training have shared and distinct features. Both demand long and intense physical training to master. Dance engages the whole body, and requires the integration of visual, auditory and motor information. In comparison, music engages specific parts of the body and primarily requires the integration of auditory and motor information. Comparing these two forms of long-term training offers a unique way to investigate brain plasticity. Therefore, in the present study we compared the effects of dance and music training on white matter (WM) structure using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and examined the relationship between training-induced brain changes and specific measures of dance and music abilities. To this aim, groups of dancers and musicians matched for years of experience were tested on a battery of behavioural tasks and a range of DTI measures. Our findings show that dancers have increased diffusivity and reduced fibre coherence in WM regions, including the corticospinal tract, superior longitudinal fasciculus and the corpus callosum. In contrast, musicians showed reduced diffusivity and greater coherence of fibres in similar regions. Crucially, diffusivity measures were related to performance on dance and music tasks that differentiated the groups. This suggests that dance and music training produce opposite effects on WM structure. We hypothesize that intensive whole-body dance training may result in greater fanning of fibres connecting different brain regions, an increase in crossing fibres, or larger axon diameter. In contrast, musical training may result in more focussed enhancements of effector-specific pathways. These findings expand our understanding of brain plasticity by emphasizing that different types of training can have different long-term effects on brain structure (Takeuchi et al., 2011; Baer et al., 2015).

These effects are often investigated in isolation ignoring any relationships between them. It is plausible that age related declines in cognitive performance are the result of age related structural and functional changes. This straightforward idea is tested in within a conceptual research model of cognitive aging. The current study tested whether age-related declines in task-performance were explained by age-related differences in brain structure and brain function using a task-switching paradigm in 175 participants. Sixty-three young and 112 old participants underwent MRI scanning of brain structure and brain activation. The experimental task was an executive context dual task with switch costs in response time as the behavioral measure. A serial mediation model was applied voxel-wise throughout the brain testing all pathways between age group, gray matter volume, brain activation and increased switch costs, worsening performance. There were widespread age group differences in gray matter volume and brain activation. Switch costs also significantly differed by age group. There were brain regions demonstrating significant indirect effects of age group on switch costs via the pathway through gray matter volume and brain activation. These were in the bilateral precuneus, bilateral parietal cortex, the left precentral gyrus, cerebellum, fusiform, and occipital cortices. There were also significant indirect effects via the brain activation pathway after controlling for gray matter volume. These effects were in the cerebellum, occipital cortex, left precentral gyrus, bilateral supramarginal, bilateral parietal, precuneus, middle cingulate extending to medial superior frontal gyri and the left middle frontal gyri. There were no significant effects through the gray matter volume alone pathway. These results demonstrate that a large proportion of the age group effect on switch costs can be attributed to individual differences in gray matter volume and brain activation. Therefore, age-related neural effects underlying cognitive control are a complex interaction between brain structure and function. Furthermore, the analyses demonstrate the feasibility of utilizing multiple neuroimaging modalities within a conceptual research model of cognitive aging.

Agmatine has antidepressant properties in rodent models of depression, and agmatinase (Agmat), the agmatine-degrading enzyme, is upregulated in the brains of mood disorder patients. We have previously shown that mice lacking CREB-regulated transcription coactivator 1 (CRTC1) associate behavioral and molecular depressive-like endophenotypes, as well as blunted responses to classical antidepressants. Here, the molecular basis of the behavioral phenotype of Crtc1(-/-) mice was further examined using microarray gene expression profiling that revealed an upregulation of Agmat in the cortex of Crtc1(-/-) mice. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot analyses confirmed Agmat upregulation in the Crtc1(-/-) prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus, which were further demonstrated by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy to comprise an increased number of Agmat-expressing cells, notably parvalbumin-and somatostatin-positive interneurons. Acute agmatine and ketamine treatments comparably improved the depressive-like behavior of male and female Crtc1(-/-) mice in the forced swim test, suggesting that exogenous agmatine has a rapid antidepressant effect through the compensation of agmatine deficit because of upregulated Agmat. Agmatine rapidly increased brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels only in the PFC of wild-type (WT) females, and decreased eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2) phosphorylation in the PFC of male and female WT mice, indicating that agmatine might be a fast-acting antidepressant with N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist properties. Collectively, these findings implicate Agmat in the depressive-like phenotype of Crtc1(-/-) mice, refine current understanding of the agmatinergic system in the brain and highlight its putative role in major depression.

Currently, most HDAC inhibitors in preclinical or clinical evaluations are non-selective inhibitors, characterised by a hydroxamate zinc-binding group (ZBG) showing off-target effects and mutagenicity. The identification of selective HDAC6 inhibitors with novel chemical properties has not been successful yet, also because of the absence of crystallographic information that makes the rational design of HDAC6 selective inhibitors difficult. Using HDAC inhibitory data retrieved from the ChEMBL database and ligand-based computational strategies, we identified 8 original new non-hydroxamate HDAC6 inhibitors from the SPECS database, with activity in the low mu M range. The most potent and selective compound, bearing a hydrazide ZBG, was shown to increase tubulin acetylation in human cells. No effects on histone H4 acetylation were observed. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of an HDAC6 selective inhibitor bearing a hydrazide ZBG. Its capability to passively cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB), as observed through PAMPA assays, and its low cytotoxicity in vitro, suggested its potential for drug development.

All of these areas have reciprocal connections with M1 [4-7]. Thus, during the evolution of the sensorimotor network, the number of interlocutors with which M1 interacts has tremendously increased. It is not clear how these additional interconnections are organized in relation to one another within the hand representation of M1. This is important because the organization of connections between M1 and phylogenetically newer and specialized cortical areas is likely to be key to the increased repertoire of hand movements in primates. In cebus monkeys, we used injections of retrograde tracers into the hand representation of different cortical areas of the sensorimotor network (ventral and dorsal premotor areas [PMv and PMd], supplementary motor area [SMA], and posterior parietal cortex [area 5]), and we analyzed the pattern of labeled neurons within the hand representation of M1. Instead of being uniformly dispersed across M1, neurons sending projections to each distant cortical area were largely segregated in different subregions of M1. These data support the view that primates split the cortical real estate of M1 into modules, each preferentially interconnected with a particular cortical area within the sensorimotor network. This modular organization could sustain parallel processing of interactions with multiple specialized cortical areas to increase the behavioral repertoire of the hand.

Using a hyper-expanded polyglutamine (84Q) knock-in mouse, we found that cerebellar Purkinje cell firing precision was degraded in heterozygous (SCA6(84Q/+)) mice at 19 months when motor deficits are observed. Similar alterations in firing precision and motor control were observed at disease onset at 7 months in homozygous (SCA6(84Q/84Q)) mice, as well as a reduction in firing rate. We further found that chronic administration of the FDA-approved drug 4-aminopyridine (4-AP), which targets potassium channels, alleviated motor coordination deficits and restored cerebellar Purkinje cell firing precision to wildtype (WT) levels in SCA6(84Q/84Q) mice both in acute slices and in vivo. These results provide a novel therapeutic approach for treating ataxic symptoms associated with SCA6.

TBC1D24 genotype-phenotype correlation: Epilepsies and other neurologic features	NEUROLOGY			English	Article							INFANTILE MYOCLONIC EPILEPSY; DOORS SYNDROME; HEARING-LOSS; 2 SIBLINGS; MUTATION; PROTEINS; NEURODEGENERATION; IMPAIRMENT; ACTIVATION; MATURATION	Objective:To evaluate the phenotypic spectrum associated with mutations in TBC1D24.Methods:We acquired new clinical, EEG, and neuroimaging data of 11 previously unreported and 37 published patients. TBC1D24 mutations, identified through various sequencing methods, can be found online (http://lovd.nl/TBC1D24).Results:Forty-eight patients were included (28 men, 20 women, average age 21 years) from 30 independent families. Eighteen patients (38%) had myoclonic epilepsies. The other patients carried diagnoses of focal (25%), multifocal (2%), generalized (4%), and unclassified epilepsy (6%), and early-onset epileptic encephalopathy (25%). Most patients had drug-resistant epilepsy. We detail EEG, neuroimaging, developmental, and cognitive features, treatment responsiveness, and physical examination. In silico evaluation revealed 7 different highly conserved motifs, with the most common pathogenic mutation located in the first. Neuronal outgrowth assays showed that some TBC1D24 mutations, associated with the most severe TBC1D24-associated disorders, are not necessarily the most disruptive to this gene function.Conclusions:TBC1D24-related epilepsy syndromes show marked phenotypic pleiotropy, with multisystem involvement and severity spectrum ranging from isolated deafness (not studied here), benign myoclonic epilepsy restricted to childhood with complete seizure control and normal intellect, to early-onset epileptic encephalopathy with severe developmental delay and early death. There is no distinct correlation with mutation type or location yet, but patterns are emerging. Given the phenotypic breadth observed, TBC1D24 mutation screening is indicated in a wide variety of epilepsies. A TBC1D24 consortium was formed to develop further research on this gene and its associated phenotypes.	[Balestrini, Simona; Sisodiya, S.

OBJECTIVES The authors sought to determine whether treatment with fludrocortisone reduces the proportion of patients with recurrent vasovagal syncope by at least 40%, representing a pre-specified minimal clinically important relative risk reduction. METHODS The multicenter POST 2 (Prevention of Syncope Trial 2) was a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial that assessed the effects of fludrocortisone in vasovagal syncope over a 1-year treatment period. All patients had >2 syncopal spells and a Calgary Syncope Symptom Score >-3. Patients received either fludrocortisone or matching placebo at highest tolerated doses from 0.05 mg to 0.2 mg daily. The main outcome measure was the first recurrence of syncope. RESULTS The authors randomized 210 patients (71% female, median age 30 years) with a median 15 syncopal spells over a median of 9 years equally to fludrocortisone or placebo. Of these, 96 patients had >= 1 syncope recurrences, and only 14 patients were lost to follow-up before syncope recurrence. There was a marginally nonsignificant reduction in syncope in the fludrocortisone group (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.69: 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.46 to 1.03; p = 0.069). In a multivariable model, fludrocortisone significantly reduced the likelihood of syncope (HR: 0.63; 95% CI: 0.42 to 0.94; p = 0.024). When the analysis was restricted to outcomes after 2 weeks of dose stabilization, there was a significant benefit due to fludrocortisone (HR: 0.51; 95% CI: 0.28 to 0.89; p = 0.019). CONCLUSIONS The study did not meet its primary objective of demonstrating that fludrocortisone reduced the likelihood of vasovagal syncope by the specified risk reduction of 40%.

Travellers and influenza: risks and prevention	JOURNAL OF TRAVEL MEDICINE			English	Review						Travel medicine; influenza; vaccination; mass gatherings; seasonality	A H5N1 VIRUS; RESPIRATORY-TRACT INFECTIONS; CLUSTER RANDOMIZED-TRIAL; SEASONAL INFLUENZA; HAND HYGIENE; HAJJ PILGRIMS; CRUISE SHIP; NEURAMINIDASE INHIBITORS; GLOBAL CIRCULATION; MASS GATHERINGS	Background: Influenza viruses are among the major causes of serious human respiratory tract infection worldwide. In line with the high disease burden attributable to influenza, these viruses play an important, but often neglected, role in travel medicine. Guidelines and recommendations regarding prevention and management of influenza in travellers are scarce. Of special interest for travel medicine are risk populations and also circumstances that facilitate influenza virus transmission and spread, like travel by airplane or cruise ship and mass gatherings. Methods: We conducted a PUBMED/MEDLINE search for a combination of the MeSH terms Influenza virus, travel, mass gathering, large scale events and cruise ship. In addition we gathered guidelines and recommendations from selected countries and regarding influenza prevention and management in travellers. By reviewing these search results in the light of published knowledge in the fields of influenza prevention and management, we present best practice advice for the prevention and management of influenza in travel medicine. Results: Seasonal influenza is among the most prevalent infectious diseases in travellers. Known host-associated risk factors include extremes of age and being immune-compromised, while the most relevant environmental factors are associated with holiday cruises and mass gatherings. Conclusions: Pre-travel advice should address influenza and its prevention for travellers, whenever appropriate on the basis of the epidemiological situation concerned. Preventative measures should be strongly recommended for travellers at high-risk for developing complications. In addition, seasonal influenza vaccination should be considered for any traveller wishing to reduce the risk of incapacitation, particularly cruise ship crew and passengers, as well as those participating in mass gatherings. Besides advice concerning preventive measures and vaccination, advice on the use of antivirals may be considered for some travellers.

Objective: Among people with relapsing-remitting and progressive forms of MS, we assessed the extent to which transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)-based biomarkers of excitatory and inhibitory cortical activity are related to cortical damage and clinical impairment. Methods: Participants included 18 healthy individuals and 36 people with MS who had a relapsing-remitting or progressive clinical course. Using TMS, intracortical facilitation (ICF), short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI), long-interval intracortical inhibition (LICI), and cortical silent period (CSP) were obtained. Cortical volume and cortical magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) were quantified. Disability was assessed with Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite (MSFC). Results: Lower mean MTR within the cerebral cortex correlated with shorter CSP among MS participants with a progressive, but not a relapsing-remitting, clinical course. Within the cortical hand knob region targeted with TMS, lower MTR was correlated with lower SICI only among individuals with relapsing-remitting MS. Longer CSP, higher ICF, lower cortical MTR, and sex were all independent significant predictors of poor upper extremity motor performance, while only cortical MTR was a significant independent predictor of total MSFC score among people with MS. Conclusions: Cortical damage and cortical activity (both inhibitory and excitatory) may contribute to the severity of motor disability experienced by people with MS. When interpreting TMS-based outcomes, cortical integrity, clinical course, and symptom type should be considered. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Identification of genetic variants of LGI1 and RTN4R (NgR1) linked to schizophrenia that are defective in NgR1-LGI1 signaling	MOLECULAR GENETICS & GENOMIC MEDICINE			English	Article						LGI1; NgR1; RhoA; RTN4R; schizophrenia; synapse formation	NOGO RECEPTOR 1; TEMPORAL-LOBE EPILEPSY; OLIGODENDROCYTE-MYELIN GLYCOPROTEIN; SYNAPTIC-TRANSMISSION; LGI1/EPITEMPIN GENE; NEURITE OUTGROWTH; INHIBITION; MUTATION; SUSCEPTIBILITY; PLASTICITY	Background The protein NgR1 is encoded by RTN4R, a gene linked to schizophrenia. We previously reported NgR1 as receptor for the epilepsy-linked protein LGI1. NgR1 regulates synapse number and synaptic plasticity, whereas LGI1 antagonizes NgR1 signaling and promotes synapse formation. Impairments in synapse formation are common in neurological disease and we hypothesized that an LGI1-NgR1 signaling pathway may contribute to the development of schizophrenia. Methods We screened two unrelated schizophrenic populations for variants in RTN4R and LGI1 using whole exome sequencing and Sanger sequencing. We tested the ability of LGI1 to bind rare coding variants of NgR1 using a cell surface binding assays and the signaling ability of NgR1 using COS7 cell-spreading assays. Results We observed a previously reported rare coding variant in RTN4R (c. 1195C>T, pR399W). We report the first LGI1 mutations to be identified in individuals with schizophrenia. Three different LGI1 mutations were found, two missense mutations (c. 205G>A, p. V69I) and (c. 313G>A, V105M), and an intronic variant (g. 897T>C) that likely leads to a protein truncation. We found NgR1(R119W) and NgR1(277C) have a reduced ability to bind LGI1 in a cell surface binding assay. COS7 cell-spreading assays reveal that NgR1 mutants are impaired in their ability to mediate RhoA activation. Conclusion Variants in NgR1 and LGI1 may be associated with schizophrenia and variants in NgR1 found in schizophrenic patients have impaired LGI1-NgR1 signaling. Impaired LGI1-NgR1 signaling may contribute to disease progression.

Recent work by our group and others has revealed the potential of fNIRS, combined with electroencephalography (EEG), in the context of human epilepsy. Hemodynamic brain responses attributed to epileptic events, such as seizures and interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs), are routinely observed with a good degree of statistical significance and in concordance with clinical presentation. Recording done with over 100 channels allows sufficiently large coverage of the epileptic focus and other areas. Three types of seizures have been documented: frontal lobe seizures, temporal lobe seizures, and posterior seizures. Increased oxygenation was observed in the epileptic focus in most cases, while rapid but similar hemodynamic variations were identified in the contralateral homologous region. While investigating IEDs, it was shown that their hemodynamic effect is observable with fNIRS, that their response is associated with significant (inhibitive) nonlinearities, and that the sensitivity and specificity of fNIRS to localize the epileptic focus can be estimated in a sample of 40 patients. This paper first reviews recent EEG-fNIRS developments in epilepsy research and then describes applications to the study of focal seizures and IEDs.

A systematic review on factors and consequences of parental distress as related to childhood cancer	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CANCER CARE			English	Review						cancer; quality of life; psychological; emotional; families	POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS SYMPTOMS; QUALITY-OF-LIFE; ACUTE LYMPHOBLASTIC-LEUKEMIA; STEM-CELL TRANSPLANTATION; BRAIN-TUMOR SURVIVORS; PEDIATRIC CANCER; PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS; PSYCHOSOCIAL ADJUSTMENT; ADOLESCENT SURVIVORS; ADULT SURVIVORS	The literature including correlates of parental distress as related to childhood cancer is abundant. It is important to identify predictive factors and outcomes of this distress in parents. The objective of this review was to update previous syntheses on factors of distress and to identify outcomes of parents' distress in the recent literature (2007-2012). We performed a systematic review to identify all quantitative studies including measures of parental distress and associated factors during the study period. We found 56 eligible studies, of which 43 had a Low risk of bias (Cochrane guidelines). Forty-two reports included potential predictive factors. Significant relationships were found with clinical history of the child, sex of the parent, coping response and personal resources, pre-diagnosis family functioning, but not education/income or marital status. Twenty-five reports studied potential consequences of distress and focused on psychological adjustment in parents and children. Compared to past periods, a higher proportion of studies included fathers. Measures used to evaluate distress were also more homogeneous in certain domains of distress. This review underscores the need for appropriate methods for selecting participants and reporting results in future studies. Appropriate methods should be used to demonstrate causality between factors/consequences and distress.

By targeting the visual cortex exclusively, we tested whether combined optimization of shape, coil placement, and electronics would yield the necessary gains in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for submillimeter visual cortex functional MRI (fMRI). Method: We optimized the shape of the housing to a population-averaged atlas. The shape was comfortable without cushions and resulted in the maximally proximal placement of the coil elements. By using small wire loops with the least number of solder joints, we were able to maximize the Q factor of the individual elements. Finally, by planning the placement of the coils using the brain atlas, we were able to target the arrangement of the coil elements to the extent of the visual cortex. Results: The combined optimizations led to as much as two-fold SNR gain compared with a whole-head 32-channel coil. This gain was reflected in temporal SNR as well and enabled fMRI mapping at 0.75 mm resolutions using a conventional GRAPPA-accelerated gradient echo echo planar imaging. Conclusion: Integrated optimization of shape, electronics, and element placement can lead to large gains in SNR and empower submillimeter fMRI at 3T. (C) 2015 The Authors.

While findings on shorter telomeres in BD are controversial, a recent study showed that long-term lithium treatment correlates with longer telomeres in BD. In our study, we sought to investigate the correlation between leukocyte telomere length (LTL) and long-term lithium treatment in a sample of 200 BD patients characterized for lithium response. We also compared data from two different methods commonly used to measure telomere length, quantitative PCR (qPCR) and quantitative fluorescence in situ hybridization (Q-FISH). We also measured, for the first time, the effect of lithium in vitro on the expression of the telomerase gene in human-derived neural progenitor cells (NPCs). Our findings showed that LTL correlated negatively with age (p=0.0002) and was independent of sex, diagnosis, age at onset, suicidal behavior, number of mood episodes, response to lithium and use of other psychotropic medications. After correcting for age, LTL was positively correlated with lithium treatment duration in patients treated for more than two years (n=150, R=0.17, p=0.037). There was a significant correlation between data measured with qPCR and Q-FISH (p=0.012, R=0.826). Lithium treatment increased telomerase expression in NPCs, though this effect was not statistically significant. Our data support previous findings showing that long-term lithium treatment associates with longer telomeres in BD, though this effect appeared to be independent from clinical response to the treatment. Moreover, we suggested for the first time that lithium increases the expression of telomerase gene in human neural progenitor cells. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. and ECNP. All rights reserved.

Systems genetic and pharmacological analysis identifies candidate genes underlying mechanosensation in the von Frey test	GENES BRAIN AND BEHAVIOR			English	Article						Casein kinase 1; linkage mapping; microarray; quantitative trait locus; transcript abundance; voltage-gated calcium channels; von Frey	PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHIC PAIN; DEPENDENT CALCIUM-CHANNELS; COMPLEX TRAIT ANALYSIS; KINASE-I FAMILY; NERVE INJURY; SPINAL-CORD; METHAMPHETAMINE SENSITIVITY; SYNAPTIC-TRANSMISSION; UP-REGULATION; MOUSE	Mechanical sensitivity is commonly affected in chronic pain and other neurological disorders. To discover mechanisms of individual differences in punctate mechanosensation, we performed quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping of the response to von Frey monofilament stimulation in BXD recombinant inbred (BXD) mice. Significant loci were detected on mouse chromosome (Chr) 5 and 15, indicating the location of underlying polymorphisms that cause heritable variation in von Frey response. Convergent evidence from public gene expression data implicates candidate genes within the loci: von Frey thresholds were strongly correlated with baseline expression of Cacna2d1, Ift27 and Csnk1e in multiple brain regions of BXD strains. Systemic gabapentin and PF-670462, which target the protein products of Cacna2d1 and Csnk1e, respectively, significantly increased von Frey thresholds in a genotype-dependent manner in progenitors and BXD strains. Real-time polymerase chain reaction confirmed differential expression of Cacna2d1 and Csnk1e in multiple brain regions in progenitors and showed differential expression of Cacna2d1 and Csnk1e in the dorsal root ganglia of the progenitors and BXD strains grouped by QTL genotype. Thus, linkage mapping, transcript covariance and pharmacological testing suggest that genetic variation affecting Cacna2d1 and Csnk1e may contribute to individual differences in von Frey filament response. This study implicates Cacna2d1 and Ift27 in basal mechanosensation in line with their previously suspected role in mechanical hypersensitivity. Csnk1e is implicated for von Frey response for the first time. Further investigation is warranted to identify the specific polymorphisms involved and assess the relevance of these findings to clinical conditions of disturbed mechanosensation.	[Young, E.

Increasing central omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid levels has been shown to have both anorectic and anxiolytic actions. Despite the strong clinical interest in GPR120, its role in the brain is largely unknown, and thus we sought to determine the impact of central GPR120 pharmacological activation on energy balance, food reward, and anxiety-like behavior. Male C57Bl/6 mice with intracerebroventricular cannulae received a single injection (0.1 or 1 A mu M) or continuous 2-week infusion (1 A mu M/d; mini-pump) of a GPR120 agonist or vehicle. Free-feeding intake, operant lever-pressing for palatable food, energy expenditure (indirect calorimetry), and body weight were measured. GPR120 mRNA expression was measured in pertinent brain areas. Anxiety-like behavior was assessed in the elevated-plus maze and open field test. GPR120 agonist injections substantially reduced chow intake during 4 hours postinjection, suppressed the rewarding effects of high-fat/-sugar food, and blunted approach-avoidance behavior in the open field. Conversely, prolonged central GPR120 agonist infusions reduced anxiety-like behavior in the elevated-plus maze and open field, yet failed to affect free-feeding intake, energy expenditure, and body weight on a high-fat diet. Acute reductions in food intake and food reward suggest that GPR120 could mediate the effects of central omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids to inhibit appetite. The anxiolytic effect elicited by GPR120 agonist infusions favors the testing of compounds that can enter the brain to activate GPR120 for the mitigation of anxiety.

Several lines of evidence suggest a role for the metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 in opioid addiction; however, its involvement during opioid withdrawal is not clear. Mice were treated with a 7-day escalating-dose morphine administration paradigm. Following withdrawal, the development of affective behaviors was assessed using the 3-chambered box, open-field, elevated plus-maze and forced-swim tests. Metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 autoradiographic binding was performed in mouse brains undergoing chronic morphine treatment and 7 days withdrawal. Moreover, since there is evidence showing direct effects of opioid drugs on the metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 system, the presence of an metabotropic glutamate receptor 5/mu-opioid receptor interaction was assessed by performing metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 autoradiographic binding in brains of mice lacking the mu-opioid receptor gene. Withdrawal from chronic morphine administration induced anxiety-like, depressive-like, and impaired sociability behaviors concomitant with a marked upregulation of metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 binding. Administration of the metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 antagonist, 3-((2-Methyl-4-thiazolyl)ethynyl)pyridine, reversed morphine abstinence-induced depressive-like behaviors. A brain region-specific increase in metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 binding was observed in the nucleus accumbens shell, thalamus, hypothalamus, and amygdala of mu-opioid receptor knockout mice compared with controls. These results suggest an association between metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 alterations and the emergence of opioid withdrawal-related affective behaviors. This study supports metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 system as a target for the development of pharmacotherapies for the treatment of opioid addiction. Moreover, our data show direct effects of mu-opioid receptor system manipulation on metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 binding in the brain.

Methods: We retrospectively retrieved all the EUS-FNAs of the pancreas that have a diagnosis of NET or SPN that were performed at 2 tertiary care hospitals in Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia from May 2004 to December 2014. Diff-Quik, Papanicolaou, and Immunohistochemistry stains on cellblock preparations were performed. Results: Twenty cases were available (16 pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (pNETs) and 4 SPNs). The pNETs were immunoreactive for synaptophysin, chromogranin A and CD56 while E-cadherin was diffusely to focally cytoplasmic positive. beta-catenin was negative or showed focal cytoplasmic immunoreactivity. In comparison, SPNs were positive for vimentin, CD10, CD-56, focally positive for progesterone receptors and synaptophysin, and revealed nuclear immunostaining for beta-catenin. They were negative for chromogranin A and E-cadherin. Conclusion: Based on EUS-FNA samples, nuclear immunoreactivity for beta-catenin with loss of membranous immunostaining for E-Cadherin can potentially facilitate differentiating SPNs from pNETs.

In order to better understand how ISOM impacts on CLBP condition, the present study contrasted ISOM aftereffects on M1 function, MF postural activation and pain with another training, the global activation of paravertebral muscles (GLOB, hip extension). The main objective of this study was to compare the effects of ISOM and GLOB (3 -week training each) on MF postural activation and M1 function in a CLBP population. Methods: Twenty-four people with CLBP were randomly allocated to ISOM and GLOB groups for a 3 week daily practice. Pre/post-training after-effects were assessed by the onset of superficial MF (MF-S) activation during ballistic limb movements (bilateral shoulder flexion in standing; unilateral hip extension in prine lying), MF-S corticomotor control tested by transcranial magnetic stimulation of MI, and assessment of pain, kinesiophobia and disability by standardized questionnaires. Results: Both ISOM and GLOB improved pain and disability. However, only ISOM influenced M1 function (decreased corticospinal excitability and increased intracortical inhibition), fastened MF-S postural activation and decreased kinesiophobia. Conclusions: Changes of corticospinal excitability and of MF-S postural adjustments suggest that ISOM better influenced brain plasticity. Future studies should further test whether our novel findings relate to an influence of the exercises on the lumbopelvic control of different muscles and on cognitive function. Clinically, individual's evaluation remains warranted before prescribing one or the other of these two conventional exercises for reducing pain. Implications: This original study presents how motor control exercises can influence brain plasticity and postural control in chronic low back pain. This knowledge will impact on the decision of clinicians to prescribe specific exercises with a view of improving motor control in this musculoskeletal condition.

Sensitivity to reward on multiple levels is a major factor in this development. We examined 736 adolescents from the IMAGEN longitudinal study for alcohol drinking during early (mean age = 14.37) and again later (mean age = 16.45) adolescence. Conducting structural equation modeling we evaluated the contribution of reward-related personality traits, behavior, brain responses and candidate genes. Personality seems to be most important in explaining alcohol drinking in early adolescence. However, genetic variations in ANKK1 (rs1800497) and HOMER1 (rs7713917) play an equal role in predicting alcohol drinking two years later and are most important in predicting the increase in alcohol consumption.

Using a 6-week piano-training protocol and pre- and post-fMRI of melody perception and imagery in adults, we dissociate learning-related patterns of neural activity from pre-training activity that predicts learning rates. Fronto-parietal and cerebellar areas related to storage of newly learned auditory-motor associations increased their response following training; in contrast, pre-training activity in areas related to stimulus encoding and motor control, including right auditory cortex, hippocampus, and caudate nuclei, was predictive of subsequent learning rate. We discuss the implications of these results for models of perceptual and of motor learning. These findings highlight the importance of considering individual predisposition in plasticity research and applications.	[Herholz, Sibylle C.; Coffey, Emily B.

While numerous studies have demonstrated edge-wise correspondence between structural and functional connections, much less is known about how large-scale coherent functional network patterns emerge from the topology of structural networks. In the present study, we deploy a multivariate statistical technique, partial least squares, to investigate the association between spatially extended structural networks and functional networks. We find multiple statistically robust patterns, reflecting reliable combinations of structural and functional subnetworks that are optimally associated with one another. Importantly, these patterns generally do not show a one-to-one correspondence between structural and functional edges, but are instead distributed and heterogeneous, with many functional relationships arising from nonoverlapping sets of anatomical connections. We also find that structural connections between high-degree hubs are disproportionately represented, suggesting that these connections are particularly important in establishing coherent functional networks. Altogether, these results demonstrate that the network organization of the cerebral cortex supports the emergence of diverse functional network configurations that often diverge from the underlying anatomical substrate.

However, there are rare circumstances in which DBS could be offered to psychiatric patients as a form of surgical innovation, therefore potentially blurring the lines between these research trials and health care. In this article, we discuss the conditions under which surgical innovation may be accepted as a practice falling at the frontiers of standard clinical care and research per se. However, recognizing this distinction does not settle all ethical issues. Our article offers ethical guideposts to allow clinicians, surgical teams, institutions, and institutional review boards to deliberate about some of the fundamental issues that should be considered before surgical innovation with psychiatric DBS is undertaken. We provide key guiding questions to sustain this deliberation. Then we review the normative and empirical literature that exists to guide reflection about the ethics of surgical innovation and psychiatric DBS with respect to general ethical questions pertinent to psychiatric DBS, multidisciplinary team perspectives in psychiatric DBS, mechanisms for oversight in psychiatric DBS, and capacity and consent in psychiatric DBS. The considerations presented here are to recognize the very specific nature of surgical innovation and to ensure that surgical innovation in the context of psychiatric DBS remains a limited, special category of activity that does not replace appropriate surgical research or become the standard of care based on limited evidence.

Denial of drug abuse and drug craving are two important factors that make the diagnosis and treatment extremely challenging. Here, we present a novel and rapid noninvasive method with potential application for differentiation and monitoring methamphetamine abuse. Methods: Visual stimuli comprised a series of images with neutral and methamphetamine-related content. A total of 10 methamphetamine abusers and 10 age-gender matched controls participated in the experiments. Event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded and compared using a time window analysis method. The ERPs were divided into 19 time windows of 100 ms with 50 ms overlaps. The area of positive sections below each window was calculated to measure the differences between the two groups. Results: Significant differences between two groups were observed from 250 to 500 ms (P300) in response to methamphetamine-related visual stimuli and 600 to 800 ms in response to neutral stimuli. Conclusion: This study presented a novel and noninvasive method based on neural correlates to discriminate healthy individuals from methamphetamine drug abusers. This method can be employed in treatment and monitoring of the methamphetamine abuse.

Although there is a general agreement that the primary afferent visual pathways are altered in congenitally blind individuals, our knowledge about microstructural changes within the higher-order visual streams, and how this is affected by onset of blindness, remains scant. We used diffusion tensor imaging and tractography to investigate microstructural features in the dorsal (superior longitudinal fasciculus) and ventral (inferior longitudinal and inferior fronto-occipital fasciculi) visual pathways in 12 congenitally blind, 15 late blind and 15 normal sighted controls. We also studied six prematurely born individuals with normal vision to control for the effects of prematurity on brain connectivity. Our data revealed a reduction in fractional anisotropy in the ventral but not the dorsal visual stream for both congenitally and late blind individuals. Prematurely born individuals, with normal vision, did not differ from normal sighted controls, born at term. Our data suggest that although the visual streams are structurally developing without normal visual input from the eyes, blindness selectively affects the microstructure of the ventral visual stream regardless of the time of onset. We suggest that the decreased fractional anisotropy of the ventral stream in the two groups of blind subjects is the combined result of both degenerative and cross-modal compensatory processes, affecting normal white matter development.

As a consequence, hallucinations constitute fascinating phenomena for the dialogue between phenomenology and neuroscience. We propose a summary of the possible strategies of this dialogue encompassing neurophenomenology or front-loaded phenomenology. We question the issue of the continuity of hallucinatory experiences, at both the subjective (phenomenology) and objective (brain imaging) levels. We also question the possible links between hallucinations and self -disorders, and discuss how these connections may add value to the understanding of hallucinations at both levels of interest. As only a very limited amount of experimental work has specifically focused on hallucinations based on this dialogue between phenomenology and brain imaging, we conclude by describing potential starting points for future studies.

Pitch perception and production in congenital amusia: Evidence from Cantonese speakers	JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA			English	Article							TONE-LANGUAGE SPEAKERS; LEXICAL TONES; MUSICAL PITCH; SINGING PROFICIENCY; SPEECH INTONATION; MONTREAL BATTERY; MANDARIN CHINESE; TUNE DEAFNESS; DISCRIMINATION; BRAIN	This study investigated pitch perception and production in speech and music in individuals with congenital amusia (a disorder of musical pitch processing) who are native speakers of Cantonese, a tone language with a highly complex tonal system. Sixteen Cantonese-speaking congenital amusics and 16 controls performed a set of lexical tone perception, production, singing, and psychophysical pitch threshold tasks. Their tone production accuracy and singing proficiency were subsequently judged by independent listeners, and subjected to acoustic analyses. Relative to controls, amusics showed impaired discrimination of lexical tones in both speech and non-speech conditions. They also received lower ratings for singing proficiency, producing larger pitch interval deviations and making more pitch interval errors compared to controls. Demonstrating higher pitch direction identification thresholds than controls for both speech syllables and piano tones, amusics nevertheless produced native lexical tones with comparable pitch trajectories and intelligibility as controls. Significant correlations were found between pitch threshold and lexical tone perception, music perception and production, but not between lexical tone perception and production for amusics. These findings provide further evidence that congenital amusia is a domain-general language-independent pitch-processing deficit that is associated with severely impaired music perception and production, mildly impaired speech perception, and largely intact speech production.

Whether the timing of the stressor in pregnancy or sex of the infant moderated the impact of the prenatal maternal stress on motor development was also explored. Mothers' objective experiences of the flood, emotional reactions and distress, and their cognitive appraisal of the event were assessed retrospectively. Infants' fine and gross motor skills were assessed with the Ages and Stages Questionnaire, and results showed age-related changes in the effects of prenatal maternal stress on these domains. At 2 months, higher levels of prenatal maternal stress was positively related to infant motor development, yet at 6 and 16 months of age there was a negative association, particularly if flood exposure occurred later in pregnancy and if mothers had negative cognitive appraisals of the event. Results also showed differential effects of the maternal stress responses to the floods on infants' fine and gross motor development at each age and that infant sex did not buffer these effects.

The most common mutation in FD patients results from a single base pair substitution of an intronic splice site in the IKBKAP gene which disrupts normal mRNA splicing and leads to tissue-specific reduction of IKBKAP protein (IKAP). To date, treatment of FD patients remains preventative, symptomatic and supportive. Based on previous in vitro evidence that tocotrienols, members of the vitamin E family, upregulate transcription of the IKBKAP gene, we aimed to investigate whether a similar effects was observed in vivo. In the current study, we assessed the effects of tocotrienol treatment on FD patients' symptoms and IKBKAP expression in white blood cells. The initial daily doses of 50 or 100 mg tocotrienol, doubled after 3 months, was administered to 32 FD patients. Twenty-eight FD patients completed the 6-month study. The first 3 months of tocotrienol treatment was associated with a significant increase in IKBKAP expression level in FD patients' blood. Despite doubling the dose after the initial 3 months of treatment, IKBKAP expression level returned to baseline by the end of the 6-month treatment. Clinical improvement was noted in the reported clinical questionnaire (with regard to dizziness, bloching, sweating, number of pneumonia, cough episodes, and walking stability), however, no significant effect was observed in any clinical measurements (weight, height, oxygen saturation, blood pressure, tear production, histamine test, vibration threshold test, nerve conduction, and heart rate variability) following Tocotrienol treatment. In conclusion, tocotrienol treatment appears significantly beneficial by clinical evaluation for some FD patients in a few clinical parameters; however it was not significant by clinical measurements. This open-label study shows the complexity of effect of tocotrienol treatment on FD patients' clinical outcomes and on IKBKAP expression level compared to in vitro results. A longitudinal study with an increased sample size is required in the future to better understand tocotrienol affect on FD patients.

Deep Independence Network Analysis of Structural Brain Imaging: Application to Schizophrenia	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MEDICAL IMAGING			English	Article						Deep learning; NICE; nonlinear ICA; schizophrenia; structural MRl	VOXEL-BASED MORPHOMETRY; GRAY-MATTER DIFFERENCES; COMPONENT ANALYSIS; 1ST-EPISODE SCHIZOPHRENIA; LIKELIHOOD ESTIMATION; METAANALYSIS; VOLUME; MRI; INFORMATION; SEPARATION	Linear independent component analysis (ICA) is a standard signal processing technique that has been extensively used on neuroimaging data to detect brain networks with coherent brain activity (functional MRI) or covarying structural patterns (structural MRI). However, its formulation assumes that the measured brain signals are generated by a linear mixture of the underlying brain networks and this assumption limits its ability to detect the inherent nonlinear nature of brain interactions. In this paper, we introduce nonlinear independent component estimation (NICE) to structural MRI data to detect abnormal patterns of gray matter concentration in schizophrenia patients. For this biomedical application, we further addressed the issue of model regularization of nonlinear ICA by performing dimensionality reduction prior to NICE, together with an appropriate control of the complexity of the model and the usage of a proper approximation of the probability distribution functions of the estimated components. We show that our results are consistent with previous findings in the literature, but we also demonstrate that the incorporation of nonlinear associations in the data enables the detection of spatial patterns that are not identified by linear ICA. Specifically, we show networks including basal ganglia, cerebellum and thalamus that show significant differences in patients versus controls, some of which show distinct nonlinear patterns.

HypothesisClinical and therapeutic variables will be identified as factors predictive of survival. AnimalsClient-owned camelids suspected of having CN admitted to Purdue University between 1995 and 2015. MethodsA retrospective study was performed. A diagnosis of CN was based on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) eosinophilic pleocytosis or postmortem findings. ResultsEleven alpacas and 9 llamas met the inclusion criteria. Seventy-five percent of the camelids were male (27% castrated and 73% intact). Common clinical abnormalities included proprioceptive deficits (100% of animals), recumbency (55%), tachypnea (55%), and ataxia (40%). Among the 85% of treated animals, 100% received PO fenbendazole, and 88% received a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug. The survival rate to discharge was 45%. Plasma fibrinogen concentration, creatine kinase activity, and serum creatinine concentration were significantly higher in nonsurvivors. Blood eosinophil count, platelet count, and total CO2 were significantly lower in nonsurvivors. Factors associated with survival were species, sex, absence of treatment with corticosteroids, and clinical improvement. There was no association between recumbency at admission and survival. A plasma fibrinogen concentration above >266 mg/dL was an excellent diagnostic test to predict survival in the presence of neurological signs or CSF eosinophilia. ConclusionsAlthough prognosis for CN in camelids is guarded, presence of recumbency at admission is not predictive of nonsurvival. Male camelids and llamas appear more likely to die from CN. Corticosteroid treatment is contraindicated in animals diagnosed with CN.	[Bertin, F. R.] McGill Univ, Dept Physiol, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Taylor, S.

However, partial efficacy, a tendency to produce tolerance, and a host of ill-tolerated side effects make clinically available opioids less effective in the management of chronic pain syndromes. Given that most therapeutic opioids produce their actions via mu-opioid receptors (MOPrs), other targets are constantly being explored, among which delta-opioid receptors (DOPrs) are being increasingly considered as promising alternatives. This review addresses DOPrs from the perspective of cellular and molecular determinants of their pharmacological diversity. Thus, DOPr ligands are examined in terms of structural and functional variety, DOPrs' capacity to engage a multiplicity of canonical and noncanonical G protein-dependent responses is surveyed, and evidence supporting ligand-specific signaling and regulation is analyzed. Pharmacological DOPr subtypes are examined in light of the ability of DOPr to organize into multimeric arrays and to adopt multiple active conformations as well as differences in ligand kinetics. Current knowledge on DOPr targeting to the membrane is examined as a means of understanding how these receptors are especially active in chronic pain management. Insight into cellular and molecular mechanisms of pharmacological diversity should guide the rational design of more effective, longer-lasting, and better-tolerated opioid analgesics for chronic pain management.

J	Qi, XY; Sun, JQ; Zheng, HQ				Qi, Xingyun; Sun, Jiaqi; Zheng, Huanquan			A GTPase-Dependent Fine ER Is Required for Localized Secretion in Polarized Growth of Root Hairs	PLANT PHYSIOLOGY			English	Article							ENDOPLASMIC-RETICULUM; TIP GROWTH; CORTICAL MICROTUBULES; ARABIDOPSIS-THALIANA; HOMOTYPIC FUSION; GOLGI-APPARATUS; POLLEN TUBES; IN-VIVO; RHO; RHD3	The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a cellular network comprising membrane tubules and sheets stretching throughout the cytoplasm. Atlastin GTPases, including Atlastin-1 in mammals and RHD3 in plants, play a role in the generation of the interconnected tubular ER network by promoting the fusion of ER tubules. Root hairs in rhd3 are short and wavy, a defect reminiscent of axon growth in cells with depleted Atlastin-1. However, how a loss in the ER complexity could lead to a defective polarized cell growth of root hairs or neurons remains elusive. Using live-cell imaging techniques, we reveal that, a fine ER distribution, which is found in the subapical zone of growing root hairs of wild-type plants, is altered to thick bundles in rhd3. The localized secretion to the apical dome as well as the apical localization of root hair growth regulator ROP2 is oscillated in rhd3. Interestingly, the shift of ROP2 precedes the shift of localized secretion as well as the fine ER distribution in rhd3. Our live imaging and pharmacologic modification of root hair growth defects in rhd3 suggest that there is interplay between the ER and microtubules in the polarized cell growth of root hairs. We hypothesize that, under the guidance of ROP2, RHD3, together with the action of microtubules, is required for the formation of a fine ER structure in the subapical zone of growing root hairs. This fine ER structure is essential for the localized secretion to the apical dome in polarized cell growth.

Recent Duplication and Functional Divergence in Parasitic Nematode Levamisole-Sensitive Acetylcholine Receptors	PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES			English	Article							GATED ION-CHANNEL; ELEGANS NEUROMUSCULAR-JUNCTION; CAENORHABDITIS-ELEGANS; HAEMONCHUS-CONTORTUS; XENOPUS-OOCYTES; MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD; GENE FAMILY; C-ELEGANS; TRICHINELLA-SPIRALIS; NICOTINIC RECEPTOR	Helminth parasites rely on fast-synaptic transmission in their neuromusculature to experience the outside world and respond to it. Acetylcholine plays a pivotal role in this and its receptors are targeted by a wide variety of both natural and synthetic compounds used in human health and for the control of parasitic disease. The model, Caenorhabditis elegans is characterized by a large number of acetylcholine receptor subunit genes, a feature shared across the nematodes. This dynamic family is characterized by both gene duplication and loss between species. The pentameric levamisole-sensitive acetylcholine receptor has been characterized from C. elegans, comprised of five different subunits. More recently, cognate receptors have been reconstituted from multiple parasitic nematodes that are found to vary in subunit composition. In order to understand the implications of receptor composition change and the origins of potentially novel drug targets, we investigated a specific example of subunit duplication based on analysis of genome data for 25 species from the 50 helminth genome initiative. We found multiple independent duplications of the unc29, acetylcholine receptor subunit, where codon substitution rate analysis identified positive, directional selection acting on amino acid positions associated with subunit assembly. Characterization of four gene copies from a model parasitic nematode, Haemonchus contortus, demonstrated that each copy has acquired unique functional characteristics based on phenotype rescue of transgenic C. elegans and electrophysiology of receptors reconstituted in Xenopus oocytes. We found evidence that a specific incompatibility has evolved for two subunits co-expressed in muscle. We demonstrated that functional divergence of acetylcholine receptors, driven by directional selection, can occur more rapidly than previously thought and may be mediated by alteration of receptor assembly. This phenomenon is common among the clade V parasitic nematodes and this work provides a foundation for understanding the broader context of changing anthelmintic drug targets across the parasitic nematodes.

The low accessibility to such equipment, combined with the emerging trend to assess mobility in a free-living environment, creates a need for body-worn sensors (e.g., inertial measurement units-IMUs) that are capable of measuring the complexity in motor performance using meaningful measurements, such as joint orientation. However, accuracy of joint orientation estimates using IMUs may be affected by environment, the joint tracked, type of motion performed and velocity. This study investigates a quality control (QC) process to assess the quality of orientation data based on features extracted from the raw inertial sensors' signals. Joint orientation (trunk, hip, knee, ankle) of twenty participants was acquired by an optical motion capture system and IMUs during a variety of tasks (sit, sit-to-stand transition, walking, turning) performed under varying conditions (speed, environment). An artificial neural network was used to classify good and bad sequences of joint orientation with a sensitivity and a specificity above 83%. This study confirms the possibility to perform QC on IMU joint orientation data based on raw signal features. This innovative QC approach may be of particular interest in a big data context, such as for remote-monitoring of patients' mobility.

New methodology combining neural network and extended great deluge algorithms for the ATR-42 wing aerodynamics analysis	AERONAUTICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						aerodynamics; neural network; wind-tunnel tests; extended great deluge	NONLINEAR F/A-18 MODEL; ON-OFF CONTROLLER; FUZZY-LOGIC; IDENTIFICATION; OPTIMIZATION; SYSTEM; VALIDATION; PREDICTION; FLIGHT	The fast determination of aerodynamic parameters such as pressure distributions, lift, drag and moment coefficients from the known airflow conditions (angles of attack, Mach and Reynolds numbers) in real time is still not easily achievable by numerical analysis methods in aerodynamics and aeroelasticity. A flight parameters control system is proposed to solve this problem. This control system is based on new optimisation methodologies using Neural Networks (NNs) and Extended Great Deluge (EGD) algorithms. Validation of these new methodologies is realised by experimental tests using a wing model installed in a wind tunnel and three different transducer systems (a FlowKinetics transducer, an AEROLAB PTA transducer and multitube manometer tubes) to determine the pressure distribution. For lift, drag and moment coefficients, the results of our approach are compared to the XFoil aerodynamics software and the experimental results for different angles of attack and Mach numbers. The main purpose of this new proposed control system is to improve, in this paper, wing aerodynamic performance, and in future to apply it to improve aircraft aerodynamic performance.

Here we demonstrate that postsynaptic knockdown of the fly homologue of LRRK2 thwarts retrograde, homeostatic synaptic compensation at the larval neuromuscular junction. Conversely, postsynaptic overexpression of either the fly or human LRRK2 transgene induces a retrograde enhancement of presynaptic neurotransmitter release by increasing the size of the release ready pool of vesicles. We show that LRRK2 promotes cap-dependent translation and identify Furin 1 as its translational target, which is required for the synaptic function of LRRK2. As the regulation of synaptic homeostasis plays a fundamental role in ensuring normal and stable synaptic function, our findings suggest that aberrant function of LRRK2 may lead to destabilization of neural circuits.

Mammalian research has established that VEN exposure is associated with a range of structural, neurochemical, and functional alterations of the brain in adults and newborns. However, the neurodevelopmental effects of VEN on non-target organisms have never been investigated. The aim of our research was to decrease this gap in knowledge by characterizing the effects of VEN exposure on a cephalopod mollusk, the common cuttlefish Sepia officinalis. This species inhabits VEN-contaminated waters and possesses an unusually sophisticated brain. These characteristics render it a unique invertebrate species for studying the neurodevelopmental effects of VEN. Cuttlefish were exposed to environmentally-relevant concentrations of VEN (Measured concentrations approximate to 5 and 100 ng L-1) or to filtered natural seawater (control) in a closed-loop system with regular water changes during the first 20 days after hatching. We evaluated brain maturation as well as neurochemical changes and behavioral performances during this critical period of development. Our results show that both VEN-exposed groups exhibited a decrease in norepinephrine levels, along with a reduction in the relative number of glutamate NMDA-like receptors binding sites in the group exposed to 5 ng L-1 of VEN after 20 days of exposure. Brain regional changes in cellular proliferation were observed in VEN-exposed groups in the vertical lobe (i.e. a key structure involved in cognitive processes) and in the optic lobes (i.e. main visual processing centers) in the absence of significant change in their volume. Along with these neurodevelopmental changes, 20 days of exposure to 100 ng L-1 of VEN was associated with a decrease in camouflage ability. Overall, our study suggests that VEN is a neurodevelopmental toxicant in non-target aquatic organisms at environmentally-relevant concentrations. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We hypothesized that remodeling of intrinsic cardiac neuronal and synaptic properties occur in canines subjected to long-term SCS, specifically that synaptic efficacy may be preferentially facilitated at high presynaptic nerve stimulation frequencies. Animals subjected to continuous SCS for 5-8weeks (long-term SCS: n=17) or for 1h (acute SCS: n=4) were compared with corresponding control animals (long-term: n=15, acute: n=4). At termination, animals were anesthetized, the heart was excised and neurones from the right atrial ganglionated plexus were identified and studied invitro using standard intracellular microelectrode technique. Main findings were as follows: (1) a significant reduction in whole cell membrane input resistance and acceleration of the course of AHP decay identified among phasic neurones from long-term SCS compared with controls, (2) significantly more robust synaptic transmission to rundown in long-term SCS during high-frequency (10-40Hz) presynaptic nerve stimulation while recording from either phasic or accommodating postsynaptic neurones; this was associated with significantly greater posttrain excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) numbers in long-term SCS than control, and (3) synaptic efficacy was significantly decreased by atropine in both groups. Such changes did not occur in acute SCS. In conclusion, modification of intrinsic cardiac neuronal properties and facilitation of synaptic transmission at high stimulation frequency in long-term SCS could improve physiologically modulated vagal inputs to the heart.

While inside a mock brain scanner, participants chose arbitrary numbers in two similar tasks. In the Mind-Reading Task, the scanner appeared to guess the participants' numbers; in the Mind-Influencing Task, it appeared to influence their choice of numbers. We predicted that participants would feel less voluntary control over their decisions when they believed that the scanner was influencing their choices. As predicted, participants felt less control and made slower decisions in the Mind-Influencing Task compared to the Mind-Reading Task. A second study replicated these findings. Participants' experience of the ostensible influence varied, with some reporting an unknown source directing them towards specific numbers. This simulated thought insertion paradigm can therefore influence feelings of voluntary control and may help model symptoms of mental disorders. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

To evaluate effects of hippocampal pathology on brain structure and functional networks, we aimed at dissociating multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) characteristics in patients with HS (TLE-HS) and those with gliosis only (TLE-G). Methods: In 20 TLE-HS, 19 TLE-G, and 25 healthy controls, we carried out a novel MRI-based hippocampal subfield surface analysis that integrated volume, T2 signal intensity, and diffusion markers with seed-based hippocampal functional connectivity. Results: Compared to controls, TLE-HS presented with marked ipsilateral atrophy, T2 hyperintensity, and mean diffusivity increases across all subfields, whereas TLE-G presented with dentate gyrus hypertrophy, focal increases in T2 intensity and mean diffusivity. Multivariate assessment confirmed a more marked ipsilateral load of anomalies across all subfields in TLE-HS, whereas anomalies in TLE-G were restricted to the subiculum. A between-cohort dissociation was independently suggested by resting-state functional connectivity analysis, revealing marked hippocampal decoupling from anterior and posterior default mode hubs in TLE-HS, whereas TLE-G did not differ from controls. Back-projection connectivity analysis from cortical targets revealed consistently decreased network embedding across all subfields in TLE-HS, while changes in TLE-G were limited to the subiculum. Hippocampal disconnectivity strongly correlated to T2 hyperintensity and marginally to atrophy. Interpretation: Multimodal MRI reveals diverging structural and functional connectivity profiles across the TLE spectrum. Pathology-specific modulations of large-scale functional brain networks lend novel evidence for a close interplay of structural and functional disruptions in focal epilepsy.

A sample of 352 mother-infant dyads came to the laboratory when infants were 5, 10, and 24months of age (final N=215). At each visit, child resting electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded. Mother-infant interactions were videotaped at the 5-month visit. The results indicated that higher quality maternal behavior during mother-infant interactions predicted higher frontal resting EEG power at 10 and 24months, as well as increases in power between 5 and 10months, and between 10 and 24months. These findings provide rare support for the hypothesis that normative variation in parenting quality may contribute to brain development among typically developing infants.

Long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFA) are essential for fetal neurodevelopment. Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is the predominant n-3 LCPUFA in the brain and retina. Circulating absolute concentrations of total n-3 and n-6 LCPUFAs rise during normal pregnancy. It remains unclear whether gestational diabetes may affect the normal rise in circulating concentrations of LCPUFAs in the third trimester of pregnancy - a period of rapid fetal neurodevelopment. This study aimed to address this question. MethodsIn a prospective singleton pregnancy cohort, fatty acids in fasting plasma total lipids were measured at 24-28 and 32-35 weeks of gestation in women with (n = 24) and without gestational diabetes mellitus (n = 116). Fatty acid desaturase activity indices were estimated by relevant product-to-precursor fatty acid ratios. Dietary nutrient intakes were estimated by a food frequency questionnaire. ResultsPlasma absolute concentrations of total n-6 LCPUFAs rose significantly between 24-28 and 32-35 weeks of gestation in women with or without gestational diabetes, whereas total n-3 LCPUFAs and DHA concentrations rose significantly only in women without gestational diabetes (all P < 0.01). Delta-5 desaturase indices (20:4n-6/20:3n-6) were similar, but delta-6 desaturase indices (18:3n-6/18:2n-6) were significantly lower in women with gestational diabetes at 32-35 weeks of gestation. Dietary intakes of all fatty acids were comparable. ConclusionThe normal rise in circulating absolute concentrations of DHA and total n-3 LCPUFAs in the third trimester of pregnancy may be compromised in gestational diabetes, probably due to impaired synthesis or mobilization rather than dietary intake difference.

Social Competence in Childhood Brain Tumor Survivors: Feasibility and Preliminary Outcomes of a Peer- Mediated Intervention	JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENTAL AND BEHAVIORAL PEDIATRICS			English	Article						social competence; brain tumor survivors; peer-mediated; childhood cancer; pediatric oncology	DEVELOPMENTAL-PSYCHOLOGY; SKILLS INTERVENTION; CHILDREN; ADJUSTMENT; TEACHER; NEUROSCIENCE; PERFORMANCE; FRIENDSHIP; DISORDER; BEHAVIOR	Objective: Evaluate the acceptability, feasibility, and preliminary outcomes of a peer-mediated intervention to improve social competence of brain tumor survivors and classmates. Method: Twelve childhood brain tumor survivors and 217 classroom peers in intervention (n = 8) or comparison (n = 4) classrooms completed measures of social acceptance and reputation at 2 time points in the year. The intervention (5-8 sessions over 4-6 weeks) taught peer leaders skills for engaging classmates. Individual and classroom outcomes were analyzed with analysis of covariance. Results: Recruitment rates of families of brain tumor survivors (81%) and schools (100%) were adequate. Peer leaders reported satisfaction with the intervention. Preliminary outcome data trended toward some benefit in increasing the number of friend nominations for survivors of brain tumors but no changes in other peer-reported metrics. Preliminary results also suggested some positive effects on classroom levels of victimization and rejection. Conclusion: A peer-mediated intervention was acceptable to families of brain tumor survivors and feasible to implement in schools. Findings warrant a larger trial to evaluate improvements for children with brain tumors and their peers.

Although previous studies reported that almost individuals with multiple cafe-au-lait macules will eventually develop NF1 based on clinical criteria, recent studies and clinical observations suggest that a significant percentage of them do not have NF1. METHODS: We conducted the first systematic review of the literature on the prevalence of definitive NF1 among patients referred for isolated cafe-au-lait macules, searching more precisely for the proportion of those patients who do not have NF1. Because we now know that the presence of cafe-au-lait macules and freckling might not distinguish between NF1 and other conditions such as Legius syndrome, definitive NF1 was defined as the presence of cafe-au-lait macules with or without freckling plus one of the following: Lisch nodules, neurofibroma, plexiform neurofibroma, bone dysplasia, optic pathway glioma, or familial history of NF1. RESULTS: Six articles reported sufficient data to meet our inclusion criteria. Grouping all studies together, we found that 19.5% to 57.1% of all patients with isolated cafe-au-lait macules did not have a diagnosis of NF1 after follow-up or genetic testing. CONCLUSION: A significant portion of the patients presenting with isolated cafe-au-lait macules at initial consultation might not have NF1. Genetic testing could help guide the follow-up of those patients, but further evidence is required to make recommendations.

Proton spectroscopy study of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in youth with familial depression	PSYCHIATRY AND CLINICAL NEUROSCIENCES			English	Article						adolescent; choline; creatine; depression; spectroscopy	MAGNETIC-RESONANCE-SPECTROSCOPY; PEDIATRIC MAJOR DEPRESSION; N-ACETYL-ASPARTATE; BIPOLAR DISORDER; MOOD DISORDERS; BRAIN; CHOLINE; ADOLESCENTS; METABOLITES; CREATINE	AimStructural, functional, and metabolic changes in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) are implicated in the pathogenesis of major depressive disorder (MDD). We used proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1) H-MRS) to examine the metabolite choline (glycerophosphocholine plus phosphocholine), which is used as an index of membrane integrity in the left DLPFC, in adolescents and young adults with MDD who were treatment-resistant and had a positive family history compared to healthy controls. Differences in the choline resonance indicate an imbalance between synthesis and degradation activity of neuronal and glia membrane phospholipids. MethodsSeventeen adolescents with MDD and 11 healthy controls underwent (1) H-MRS. A short echo point-resolved spectroscopy (echo time = 30 ms, repetition time = 2000 ms) protocol was used with a voxel (4.5cm(3), 128 averages) placed within the left DLPFC. ResultsThere were significantly increased choline (P = 0.04) and creatine concentrations (P = 0.005) in the left DLPFC of the MDD group compared to controls. In MDD participants, choline concentration correlated with scores on the Beck Depression Inventory (r = 0.41, P = 0.03). ConclusionIncreased left DLPFC choline and creatine levels in depressed adolescents may be biomarkers for the disorder. The increased choline levels may indicate abnormalities in neuronal membrane integrity, and the increased creatine could be reflective of altered energy demands and metabolism.

IL-10-dependent Tr1 cells attenuate astrocyte activation and ameliorate chronic central nervous system inflammation	BRAIN			English	Article						astrocyte; neuroinflammation; multiple sclerosis; T-lymphocytes; interleukin 10	REGULATORY T-CELLS; PROGRESSIVE MULTIPLE-SCLEROSIS; EXPERIMENTAL AUTOIMMUNE ENCEPHALOMYELITIS; INTERLEUKIN-10 RECEPTOR; MICROGLIA; DISEASE; ROLES; BRAIN; DIFFERENTIATION; MONOCYTES	The innate immune system plays a central role in the chronic central nervous system inflammation that drives neurological disability in progressive forms of multiple sclerosis, for which there are no effective treatments. The mucosal immune system is a unique tolerogenic organ that provides a physiological approach for the induction of regulatory T cells. Here we report that nasal administration of CD3-specific antibody ameliorates disease in a progressive animal model of multiple sclerosis. This effect is IL-10-dependent and is mediated by the induction of regulatory T cells that share a similar transcriptional profile to Tr1 regulatory cells and that suppress the astrocyte inflammatory transcriptional program. Treatment results in an attenuated inflammatory milieu in the central nervous system, decreased microglia activation, reduced recruitment of peripheral monocytes, stabilization of the blood-brain barrier and less neurodegeneration. These findings suggest a new therapeutic approach for the treatment of progressive forms of multiple sclerosis and potentially other types of chronic central nervous system inflammation.

The general term cognitive energy was chosen to facilitate the broadest possible discussion of the topic. It goes back to Titchener (1908) who described the effects of attention on perception; he used the term psychic energy for the notion that limited mental resources can be flexibly allocated among perceptual and mental activities. The workshop focused on three main areas: (1) theories, models, concepts, definitions, and frameworks; (2) methods and measures; and (3) knowledge translation. We defined effort as the deliberate allocation of mental resources to overcome obstacles in goal pursuit when carrying out a task, with listening effort applying more specifically when tasks involve listening. We adapted Kahneman's seminal (1973) Capacity Model of Attention to listening and proposed a heuristically useful Framework for Understanding Effortful Listening (FUEL). Our FUEL incorporates the well-known relationship between cognitive demand and the supply of cognitive capacity that is the foundation of cognitive theories of attention. Our FUEL also incorporates a motivation dimension based on complementary theories of motivational intensity, adaptive gain control, and optimal performance, fatigue, and pleasure. Using a three-dimensional illustration, we highlight how listening effort depends not only on hearing difficulties and task demands but also on the listener's motivation to expend mental effort in the challenging situations of everyday life.

The focus of the review is on normative age-related changes in cognition; however, consideration is also given to older adults who experience clinically significant deficits in cognition, such as persons with Alzheimer's disease or who may be in a preclinical stage of dementia (mild cognitive impairment). The article distinguishes between the assessment of cognitive function for clinical versus research purposes. It reviews the goal of cognitive testing in older adults and discusses the challenges of validly assessing cognition in persons with sensory impairments. The article then discusses the goals of assessing specific cognitive functions (processing speed and attentional processes) for the purpose of understanding their relationships with listening effort. Finally, the article highlights certain concepts that are likely to be relevant to listening effort and cognitive energy, including some issues that have not yet received much attention in this context (e.g., conation, cognitive reserve, and second language speech processing).

However, it is unclear whether HNCS inhibits non-nociceptive processes, which needs to be clarified for a better understanding of HNCS analgesia. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of HNCS on perception and scalp somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs). Seventeen healthy volunteers participated in two counter-balanced sessions, including non-nociceptive (selective A-fibre activation) or nociceptive electrical stimulation, combined with HNCS. HNCS was produced by a 20-min cold pressor test (left hand) adjusted individually to produce moderate pain (mean +/- SEM: 42.5 +/- 5.3 on a 0-100 scale, where 0 is no pain and 100 the worst pain imaginable). Non-nociceptive electrical stimulation was adjusted individually at 80% of pain threshold and produced a tactile sensation in every subject. Nociceptive electrical stimulation was adjusted individually at 120% of RIII-reflex threshold and produced moderate pain (45.3 +/- 4.5). Shock sensation was significantly decreased by HNCS compared with baseline for non-nociceptive (P<0.001) and nociceptive (P<0.001) stimulation. SEP peak-to-peak amplitude at Cz was significantly decreased by HNCS for non-nociceptive (P<0.01) and nociceptive (P<0.05) stimulation. These results indicate that perception and brain activity related to A-fibre activation are inhibited by HNCS. The mechanisms of this effect remain to be investigated to clarify whether it involves inhibition of spinal wide-dynamic-range neurons by diffuse noxious inhibitory controls, supraspinal processes or both.

Molecules that interact to control equilibrium within an organism form physiological regulatory networks. It is essential to determine whether particular components of physiological regulatory networks evolve or if the network as a whole is affected in populations diverging in behavioural responses, as this may affect the nature, amplitude and number of impacted traits. We studied the regulation of four physiological regulatory networks in freshwater and marine populations of threespine stickleback raised in a common environment, which were previously characterized as showing evolutionary divergence in behaviour and stress reactivity. We measured nineteen components of these networks (ligands and receptors) using mRNA and monoamine levels in the brain, pituitary and interrenal gland, as well as hormone levels. Freshwater fish showed higher expression in the brain of adrenergic (adrb2a), serotonergic (htr2a) and dopaminergic (DRD2) receptors, but lower expression of the htr2b receptor. Freshwater fish also showed higher expression of the mc2r receptor of the glucocorticoid axis in the interrenals. Collectively, our results suggest that the inheritance of the regulation of these networks may be implicated in the evolution of behaviour and stress reactivity in association with population divergence. Our results also suggest that evolutionary change in freshwater threespine stickleback may be more associated with the expression of specific receptors rather than with global changes of all the measured constituents of the physiological regulatory networks.

Design and Setting: A prospective observational and laboratory study conducted in PICUs at five Canadian children's hospitals. Study Population and Measurements: Fifty-eight patients aged 5 to 17 years with traumatic brain injury were enrolled in the study. Nine brain-specific and inflammatory serum protein biomarkers were measured multiple times over the first week following injury. Attention was measured at "baseline" to represent pre-injury function and at 1 year following injury using the Conners Third Parent Rating Scale. Results: Compared with baseline, there were significantly more clinical symptoms of inattention at 1 year post injury. The Glasgow Coma Scale score, age at injury, baseline levels of inattention, and highest levels of serum biomarkers were used to estimate the probability of developing inattention. These independent variables were first evaluated individually followed by combinations of the best predictors using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve analyses. A combination of high baseline levels of inattention and high serum levels of the biomarker neuron-specific enolase was the best predictor for inattention. Glasgow Coma Scale and age at injury were not associated with inattention at 1 year post injury. Conclusions: Combining baseline assessment of attention with measurement of serum biomarkers shows promise as reliable, early predictors of long-term attention after childhood traumatic brain injury.

In general, the literature shows that DBS is effective for PD, essential tremor, and idiopathic dystonia. In these cases, key points in patient selection must include the level of disability and inability to manage symptoms using the best available medical therapy. Results are, however, still not optimal when dealing with other aetiologies, such as secondary tremors and symptomatic dystonia. Also, in PD, issues such as age and neuropsychiatric profile are still debatable parameters. Overall, currently available literature is able to guide physicians on basic aspects of patient selection and indications for DBS; however, a few points are still debatable and controversial. These issues should be refined and clarified in future studies.

It has become an established technique in the field of neuroimaging of aging and dementia, with data incorporated in the new consensus guidelines for the diagnosis of Alzheimer disease and predementia Alzheimer's disease-related conditions. At this point, there are three US Food and Drug Administration- and European Union-approved tracers. Guided by appropriate use criteria developed in 2013 by the Alzheimer's Association and the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging, the utility of amyloid imaging in medical practice is now supported by a growing body of research. In this paper, we aimed to provide an update on the 2012 Canadian consensus guidelines to dementia care practitioners on proper use of amyloid imaging. We also wished to generate momentum for the industry to submit a new drug proposal to Health Canada. A group of local, national, and international dementia experts and imaging specialists met to discuss scenarios in which amyloid PET could be used appropriately. Peer-reviewed and published literature between January 2004 and May 2015 was searched. Technical and regulatory considerations pertaining to Canada were considered. The results of a survey of current practices in Canadian dementia centers were considered. A set of specific clinical and research guidelines was agreed on that defines the types of patients and clinical circumstances in which amyloid PET could be used in Canada. Future research directions were also outlined, notably the importance of studies that would assess the pharmaco-economics of amyloid imaging.

Although mood dysfunction is common in referrals to memory clinics, the influence of mood on the MoCA has to date been largely unexplored. Method: In this study, we examined the impact of mood dysfunction on the MoCA using a memory clinic sample of individuals with depressive symptoms who did not meet criteria for a neurodegenerative disease. Results: Half of the group with depressive symptoms scored below the MoCA-suggested cutoff for cognitive impairment. As a group, they scored below healthy controls, but above individuals with Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia. A MoCA subtask analysis revealed a pattern of executive/attentional dysfunction in those with depressive symptoms. Conclusions: This observed negative impact of depressive symptomatology on the MoCA has interpretative implications for its utility as a cognitive screening tool in a memory clinic setting.

However, its reliability has not been fully proven in critical vascular lesions when it comes to replacing a more invasive examination such as cerebral angiography. We wished to validate the accuracy of this equipment to investigate four common indications for patients to undergo conventional digital subtraction angiography: subarachnoid hemorrhage, vasospasm, unusual intracerebral hemorrhage, and unruptured aneurysm. Methods: Radiological reports and relevant imaging from 82 consecutive subjects who underwent a 320-row multidetector CTA followed by cerebral angiography from February 2010 to February 2014 were retrospectively analysed. A total of 102 cerebrovascular anomalies were found. Reports from both imaging modalities were compared to determine the diagnostic accuracy of CTA. Results: The overall sensitivity and specificity of 320-row multidetector CTA for detecting cerebrovascular abnormalities were, respectively, 97.60% and 63.20%. Similar results were obtained for all four categories of clinical indications. Conclusion: Results obtained from CTA were consistent with those obtained on digital subtraction angiography regardless of the vascular pathology. To our knowledge, this study is the first validating the accuracy of 320-row CTA in diagnosing critical cerebrovascular lesions.

This guideline is based on recent systematic reviews of high-quality studies. A multidisciplinary expert panel considered the evidence of effectiveness, safety, cost-effectiveness, societal and ethical values, and patient experiences (obtained from qualitative research) when formulating recommendations. Target audience includes clinicians; target population is adults with grades I-III NAD < 6 months duration. Clinicians should rule out major structural or other pathologies as the cause of NAD. Once major pathology has been ruled out, clinicians should classify NAD as grade I, II, or III. Clinicians should assess prognostic factors for delayed recovery from NAD. Clinicians should educate and reassure patients about the benign and self-limited nature of the typical course of NAD grades I-III and the importance of maintaining activity and movement. Patients with worsening symptoms and those who develop new physical or psychological symptoms should be referred to a physician for further evaluation at any time during their care. For NAD grades I-II a parts per thousand currency sign3 months duration, clinicians may consider structured patient education in combination with: range of motion exercise, multimodal care (range of motion exercise with manipulation or mobilization), or muscle relaxants. In view of evidence of no effectiveness, clinicians should not offer structured patient education alone, strain-counterstrain therapy, relaxation massage, cervical collar, electroacupuncture, electrotherapy, or clinic-based heat. For NAD grades I-II > 3 months duration, clinicians may consider structured patient education in combination with: range of motion and strengthening exercises, qigong, yoga, multimodal care (exercise with manipulation or mobilization), clinical massage, low-level laser therapy, or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. In view of evidence of no effectiveness, clinicians should not offer strengthening exercises alone, strain-counterstrain therapy, relaxation massage, relaxation therapy for pain or disability, electrotherapy, shortwave diathermy, clinic-based heat, electroacupuncture, or botulinum toxin injections. For NAD grade III a parts per thousand currency sign3 months duration, clinicians may consider supervised strengthening exercises in addition to structured patient education. In view of evidence of no effectiveness, clinicians should not offer structured patient education alone, cervical collar, low-level laser therapy, or traction. For NAD grade III > 3 months duration, clinicians should not offer a cervical collar. Patients who continue to experience neurological signs and disability more than 3 months after injury should be referred to a physician for investigation and management. Clinicians should reassess the patient at every visit to determine if additional care is necessary, the condition is worsening, or the patient has recovered. Patients reporting significant recovery should be discharged.

Studies were included in the qualitative review if they (1) enrolled participants with diagnosis of Parkinson disease, Lewy body dementia, or any other neurodegenerative parkinsonian disorders; (2) assessed the efficacy of quetiapine; and (3) evaluated psychotic and motor outcomes using validated tools. Of the 341 manuscripts identified, 7 studies fulfilled our inclusion criteria. The studies' risk of bias was considered low. A total of 241 participants enrolled in these trials. Heterogeneity was high due to inclusion criteria, user definitions, assessment tools, and study design. Although not causing any motor deterioration, quetiapine failed to significantly reduce psychotic symptoms compared to placebo when objectively assessed on the Brief Psychotic Rating Scale, the most frequently reported scale in these studies. High loss to follow-up and dropout rates as well as significant improvement in psychotic symptoms in the placebo groups may have affected measurements of possible positive medication effects.

J	Phelps, S				Phelps, Scott			Brain Ways: Meynert, Bachelard and the Material Imagination of the Inner Life	MEDICAL HISTORY			English	Article						Theodor Meynert; Gaston Bachelard; Material images; Brain anatomy; Psychiatry; Interiority		The Austrian psychiatrist Theodor Meynert's anatomical theories of the brain and nerves are laden with metaphorical imagery, ranging from the colonies of empire to the tentacles of jellyfish. This paper analyses among Meynert's earliest works a different set of less obvious metaphors, namely, the fibres, threads, branches and paths used to elaborate the brain's interior. I argue that these metaphors of material, or what the philosopher Gaston Bachelard called material images', helped Meynert not only to imaginatively extend the tracts of fibrous tissue inside the brain but to insinuate their function as pathways co-extensive with the mind. Above all, with reference to Bachelard's study of the material imagination, I argue that Meynert helped entrench the historical intuition that the mind, whatever it was, consisted of some interiority - one which came to be increasingly articulated through the fibrous confines of the brain.

Chronically instrumented fetal sheep served as controls (N = 10) or underwent repeated UCOs for up to 4 hours or until arterial pH was <7.00. Normoxic-UCO (N = 9) and hypoxic-UCO (N = 5) fetuses had arterial O-2 saturation pre-UCOs of >55% and <55%, respectively, whereas lipopolysaccharide (LPS) UCO fetuses (N = 6) received LPS intra-amniotic (2 mg/h) starting 1 hour pre-UCOs. Animals were euthanized at 48 hours of recovery with fetal brains processed for assessment of inflammation (microglia and mast cell counts) and injury (necrosishematoxylin and eosinand apoptosis-cleaved caspase-3 and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling [TUNEL]). Repetitive UCOs resulted in severe acidemia in most animals with pH approaching 7.00 for all 3 UCO groups. However, there was no significant effect on measures of brain inflammation or injury, except in the LPS-UCO animals where TUNEL-positive cells were increased in the hippocampus, although small animal numbers in the hypoxic-UCO group may have limited the ability to detect significance in their TUNEL cell findings. We were therefore unable to confirm our working hypothesis since the near-term ovine fetal brain showed remarkable tolerance for these cord occlusion insults and likely involving protective metabolic mechanisms, despite the severe acidemia noted.

A prospective, randomized, controlled, parallel, single-blinded noninferiority multicenter pivotal FDA IDE trial. Objective. The objective of this study was to investigate efficacy and safety of i-Factor Bone Graft (i-Factor) compared with local autograft in single-level anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) for cervical radiculopathy. Summary of Background Data. i-Factor is a composite bone substitute material consisting of the P-15 synthetic collagen fragment adsorbed onto anorganic bone mineral and suspended in an inert biocompatible hydrogel carrier. P-15 has demonstrated bone healing efficacy in dental, orthopedic, and nonhuman applications. Methods. Patients randomly received either autograft (N = 154) or i-Factor (N = 165) in a cortical ring allograft. Study success was defined as noninferiority in fusion, Neck Disability Index (NDI), and Neurological Success endpoints, and similar adverse events profile at 12 months. Results. At 12 months (follow-up rate 87%), both i-Factor and autograft subjects demonstrated a high fusion rate (88.97% and 85.82%, respectively, noninferiority P = 0.0004), significant improvements in NDI (28.75 and 27.40, respectively, noninferiority P<0.0001), and high Neurological Success rate (93.71% and 93.01%, respectively, noninferiority P<0.0001). There was no difference in the rate of adverse events (83.64% and 82.47% in the i-Factor and autograft groups, respectively, P = 0.8814). Overall success rate consisting of fusion, NDI, Neurological Success and Safety Success was higher in i-Factor subjects than in autograft subjects (68.75% and 56.94%, respectively, P = 0.0382). Improvements in VAS pain and SF-36v2 scores were clinically relevant and similar between the groups. A high proportion of patients reported good or excellent Odom outcomes (81.4% in both groups). Conclusion. i-Factor has met all four FDA mandated noninferiority success criteria and has demonstrated safety and efficacy in single-level ACDF for cervical radiculopathy. i-Factor and autograft groups demonstrated significant postsurgical improvement and high fusion rates.

Alternative splicing of this gene generates at least four (A-D) isoforms; however, the major isoform in vivo is yet to be determined. The protein localization has neither been revealed. We have generated anti-mouse PIPS specific monoclonal antibody and analyzed the protein expression in wild-type and Ptp delta knockout mice. Immunoblot analysis of various organs revealed that neuronal tissues express both C-and D-isoforms of PTP delta, whereas non-neuronal tissues express only C-isoform. Immunohistochemistry of wild-type or Ptp delta heterozygous sections showed that olfactory bulb, cerebral cortex, hippocampus, cerebellum, and several nuclei in brain stem exhibit moderate to strong positive signals. These signals were absent in Ptp delta knockout specimens. Higher magnification revealed differences between expression patterns of PTP delta mRNA and its protein product. In hippocampus, weak mRNA expression in CA1 stratum pyramidale but strong immunostaining in the stratum lacunosum moleculare was observed, suggesting the axonal expression of PTP delta in the entorhinal cortical afferents. Olfactory mitral cells exhibited mRNA expression in cell bodies and protein localization in their dendritic fields, glomerular and external plexiform layers. Nissl staining showed that the external plexiform layer was reduced in Ptp delta knockout mice. Golgi-impregnation confirmed the poor dendritic growth of homozygous mitral cells. These results suggest that PTP delta may localize in axons as well as in dendrites to regulate their elaboration in the central nervous system. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We previously showed that PRL-2 modulates intracellular Mg2+ levels and sustains cancer phenotypes by binding to the Mg2+ transporter CNNM3. However, the physiological functions of PRL-2 in animals remain largely unknown. To better understand which cell types are associated with PRL-2 function, we characterized its expression in mouse tissues using a PRL-2 beta-galactosidase reporter mouse model. Our results demonstrated that PRL-2 was ubiquitously expressed, with the highest expression levels observed in the hippocampal pyramidal neurons, ependymal cells, cone and rod photoreceptor cells, endocardium, vascular and bronchial smooth muscle, and collecting ducts in the kidney. On the other hand, PRL-2 expression was undetectable or very low in the parenchymal cells of the liver and pancreas. Our results also indicated that PRL-2 is involved in cell-type-specific Mg2+ homeostasis and that PRL-2 expression is potentially inversely regulated by dietary Mg2+ levels.

Wideband reflectance measurements in newborns: Relationship to otoscopic findings	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PEDIATRIC OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Annual Spring Meeting of the American-Society-of-Pediatric-Otolaryngology	APR 23-26, 2015	Boston, MA	Amer Soc Pediat Otolaryngol		Newborn; Hearing screening; Wideband reflectance; Otoscopic findings	HEARING IMPAIRMENT; HEALTHY NEWBORN; YOUNG-CHILDREN; EAR; INFANTS; TYMPANOMETRY; IDENTIFICATION; APPEARANCE	Objectives: Newborn hearing screening includes testing with otoacoustic emissions and the auditory brain stem response. Unfortunately, both tests are affected by the presence of material in the ear canal and middle ear such as vernix, meconium, and amniotic fluid. The objective of this study was to determine to what extent occlusion of the ear canal as seen on otoscopy affects wideband energy reflectance measurements in newborns. A secondary objective was to obtain additional normative wideband reflectance data in newborns. Methods: Newborns from a well-baby nursery were enrolled. Wideband energy reflectance measurements and otoscopy were done immediately after the hearing screening. Occlusion of the ear canal as seen on otoscopy was described on a scale of 0-100%. Results: A total of 156 babies were enrolled (mean age = 25 hours). A statistically significant difference in the reflectance at ambient pressure was found between the 0-70% and 80-100% occlusion groups. There was no significant difference in reflectance between the right and the left ears. The median reflectance pattern generally followed that of previous studies but in certain frequency regions the present reflectance values were higher. Conclusion: A significant increase in reflectance occurs when 70%-80% of the ear-canal diameter is occluded. Taking otoscopy findings into account may improve the interpretation of reflectance measurements. However, further studies are required to better establish the relationship between canal occlusion and reflectance. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Recent studies have reported long-term abnormalities in the white matter (WM) tracts of male athletes. The corpus callosum (CC) and corticospinal tract (CST) have been shown to be particularly vulnerable to concussion, which may be related to abnormal interhemispheric functional connectivity and motor impairments. These anatomical pathways, however, have not been investigated in female athletes despite the functional significance of the CC and CST to adequate sports performance. In the present study, 8 healthy, unconcussed female athletes (soccer, hockey) were compared with 10 female athletes (soccer, hockey, water polo) 6 months post-concussion. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of the CC and CST was conducted in a 3T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner. DTI analysis showed no significant differences between groups within the CST but revealed differences between groups in the CC. The concussed group had lower mean diffusivity (t = 2.14; p = 0.048) and lower radial diffusivity (t = 2.91; p = 0.010) in the region of the CC projecting to the prefrontal cortex. A lower volume of WM fibers was found in the region projecting to the premotor and supplementary motor areas (t = 2.14; p = 0.048). Finally, lower axial diffusivity (AD) was observed in the CC area projecting mainly to the parietal and temporal area (t = 2.23; p = 0.041). Long-term alterations in the CC of female athletes appear to affect mostly the anterior part of the CC projecting to the prefrontal and premotor areas. Further studies are needed to determine whether these alterations are associated with a higher risk of sustaining a subsequent concussive injury.

Review of the identified papers was based on the standards regarding the methodology for systematic reviews set forth by the World Workshop on Oral Medicine IV and the PRISMA statement. Eligible papers were assessed for both the degree and strength of relevance to the pathogenesis of MISGD as well as on the appropriateness of the study design and sample size. A total of 99 papers were retained for the final analysis. MISGD in human studies was generally reported as xerostomia (the sensation of oral dryness) without measurements of salivary secretion rate. Medications may act on the central nervous system (CNS) and/or at the neuroglandular junction on muscarinic, -and -adrenergic receptors and certain peptidergic receptors. The types of medications that were most commonly implicated for inducing salivary gland dysfunction were those acting onthe nervous, cardiovascular, genitourinary, musculoskeletal, respiratory, and alimentary systems. Although many medications may affect the salivary flow rate and composition, most of the studies considered only xerostomia. Thus, further human studies are necessary to improve our understanding of the association between MISGD and the underlying pathophysiology.

In addition, TRPV1 also contributes to multiple pathophysiological states in respiratory, cardiovascular, metabolic, and renal systems. These contributions are further supported by evidence that variations in the human TRPV1 (hTRPV1) gene are associated with various physiological and pathological phenotypes. However, it is not well understood how the variations in hTRPV1 affect channel functions. In this study, we examined functional consequences of amino acid variations of hTRPV1 induced by 5 nonsynonymous single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that most commonly exist in the human population. Using electrophysiological assays in HEK293 cells, we examined 9 parameters: activation, Ca2+ permeation, and desensitization after activation by capsaicin, acid, and heat. Our results demonstrated that the 5 SNPs differentially affected functional properties of hTRPV1 in an agonist-dependent manner. Based upon the directionality of change of each phenotype and cumulative changes in each SNP, we classified the 5 SNPs into 3 presumptive functional categories: gain of function (hTRPV1 Q85R, P91S, and T469I), loss of function (I585V), and mixed (M315I). These results reveal a spectrum of functional variation among common hTRPV1 polymorphisms in humans and may aid mechanistic interpretation of phenotypes associated with nonsynonymous hTRPV1 SNPs under pathophysiological conditions.

Iron-refractory IDA (IRIDA) has recently been described as an inherited cause of IDA due to loss-of-function mutations in the TMPRSS6 gene. IRIDA is characterized by a lack of response to iron replacement. Here we report a new case of IRIDA with its biological parameters and its functional consequences, including neuropsychological impact. The latter was evaluated by the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence-Fourth Edition and subtests. We report a 5-year-old French Canadian boy who was incidentally diagnosed with a severe microcytic anemia at 2 years of age (hemoglobin 52 g/L, mean corpuscular volume 50 fL). Except mild pallor, he was asymptomatic of his anemia. Although he had a slight response to intravenous iron therapy, his hemoglobin remained <92 g/L, with persistent microcytosis, low serum iron, but normal ferritin levels. Blood hepcidin level was higher than those of his parents and control (patient 11.2 nM, father 9.06 nM, mother 4.07 nM). Compound heterozygosity for TMPRSS6 paternally inherited c.1324G>A and maternally inherited c.1807G>C mutations were eventually identified. The patient had normal development and growth. Neuropsychological evaluation revealed excellent performance, with high Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence-Fourth Edition scores (ie, 82nd percentile for both global intelligence and general ability index). In conclusion, TMPRSS6 c.1807G>C in conjunction with c.1324G>A results in IRIDA. In contrast to the usual form of IDA, IRIDA may not be associated with neuropsychological deficits.

Thus, understanding the effects of acute nicotine withdrawal on responses to stress is important to intervene to prevent stress-induced relapse. The current study investigated the neural correlates of psychosocial stress during acute nicotine withdrawal in chronic smokers. Methods Thirty-nine treatment-seeking smokers were randomized to one of two conditions (abstinent 24 h (n=21) or smoking as usual (n=18)). They were then exposed to the Montreal Imaging Stress Task (MIST), a psychosocial stress task consisting of difficult mental arithmetic problems while receiving negative performance feedback while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Results Subjective measures of stress increased following the MIST, compared to baseline. Whole brain between-group analysis identified significant activation clusters in four regions for the stress induction minus control contrast: inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), anterior/para cingulate cortex (ACC), precuneus, and supramarginal gyrus (SMG). In all regions, the deprived group showed significantly greater activation compared to the non-deprived group. No significant correlations were found between subjective stress and BOLD signal activation (ps>0.07). Conclusions This study provides new evidence that brain regions previously shown to be predictive of relapse, such as the precuneus and IFG, display heightened neural responses to stress during nicotine deprivation. These data identify the brain regions that may be associated with withdrawal-related stress responses. Increased stress-related activation during nicotine withdrawal may identify those most vulnerable to relapse and represent a target for novel pharmacological intervention.

Indexing Effects of Copy Number Variation on Genes Involved in Developmental Delay	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							DE-NOVO MUTATIONS; AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER; MEDIAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; GENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION; INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY; MENTAL-RETARDATION; NETWORK ANALYSIS; SCHIZOPHRENIA; VARIANTS; MAP	A challenge in clinical genomics is to predict whether copy number variation (CNV) affecting a gene or multiple genes will manifest as disease. Increasing recognition of gene dosage effects in neurodevelopmental disorders prompted us to develop a computational approach based on critical-exon (highly expressed in brain, highly conserved) examination for potential etiologic effects. Using a large CNV dataset, our updated analyses revealed significant (P < 1.64 x 10(-15)) enrichment of critical-exons within rare CNVs in cases compared to controls. Separately, we used a weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) to construct an unbiased protein module from prenatal and adult tissues and found it significantly enriched for critical exons in prenatal (P < 1.15 x 10(-50), OR = 2.11) and adult (P < 6.03 x 10(-18), OR = 1.55) tissues. WGCNA yielded 1,206 proteins for which we prioritized the corresponding genes as likely to have a role in neurodevelopmental disorders. We compared the gene lists obtained from critical-exon and WGCNA analysis and found 438 candidate genes associated with CNVs annotated as pathogenic, or as variants of uncertain significance (VOUS), from among 10,619 developmental delay cases. We identified genes containing CNVs previously considered to be VOUS to be new candidate genes for neurodevelopmental disorders (GIT1, MVB12B and PPP1R9A) demonstrating the utility of this strategy to index the clinical effects of CNVs.

These are met by a wide array of alterations in maternal physiology and behavior that are coordinated with the needs of the developing young, and include adaptations in neuroendocrine systems not directly involved in maternal behavior or lactation. In this article, attenuations in the behavioral and neuroendocrine responses to stressors, the alterations in metabolic pathways facilitating both increased food intake and conservation of energy, and the changes in fertility that occur postpartum are described. The mechanisms underlying these processes as well as the factors that contribute to them and the relative contributions of these stimuli at different times postpartum are also reviewed. The induction and maintenance of the adaptations observed in the postpartum maternal brain are dependent on mother-young interaction and, in most cases, on suckling stimulation and its consequences for the hormonal profile of the mother. The peptide hormone prolactin acting on receptors within the brain makes a major contribution to changes in metabolic pathways, suppression of fertility and the attenuation of the neuroendocrine response to stress during lactation. Oxytocin is also released, both into the circulation and in some hypothalamic nuclei, in response to suckling stimulation and this hormone has been implicated in the decrease in anxiety behavior seen in the early postpartum period. The relative importance of these hormones changes across lactation and it is becoming increasingly clear that many of the adaptations to motherhood reviewed here reflect the outcome of multiple influences.

Self generated sounds evoke a smaller brain response than externally generated ones. This attenuated response may reflect a predictive mechanism to differentiate the sensory consequences of one's own actions from other sensory input. It may also relate to the feeling of being the agent of the movement and its effects, but little is known about how sensory suppression of brain responses to self-generated sounds is related to judgments of agency. To address this question, we recorded event-related potentials in response to sounds initiated by button presses. In one condition, participants perceived agency over the production of the sounds, whereas in another condition, participants experience an illusory lack of agency caused by changes in the delay between actions and effects. We compared trials in which the timing of button press and sound was physically identical, but participants' agency judgment differed. Results show reduced amplitudes of the auditory N1 component in response to self-generated sounds irrespective of agency experience, whilst P2 effects correlate with the perception of agency. Our findings suggest that suppression of the auditory N1 component to self-generated sounds does not depend on adaptation to specific action-effect time delays, and does not determine agency judgments, however, the suppression of the P2 component might relate more directly to the experience of agency.

Mutations in SPG7 cause the autosomal recessive spastic paraplegia type 7 (SPG7), but recent studies indicate that they are also one of the most common causes of recessive cerebellar ataxia. In Quebec, a significant number of patients affected with cerebellar ataxia and spasticity remain without a molecular diagnosis. We performed whole-exome sequencing in three French Canadian (FC) patients affected with spastic ataxia and uncovered compound heterozygous variants in SPG7 in all three. Sanger sequencing of SPG7 exons and exon/intron boundaries was used to screen additional patients. In total, we identified recessive variants in SPG7 in 22 FC patients belonging to 12 families (38.7% of the families screened), including two novel variants. The p.(Ala510Val) variant was the most common in our cohort. Cerebellar features, including ataxia, were more pronounced than spasticity in this cohort. These results strongly suggest that variants affecting the function of SPG7 are the fourth most common form of recessive ataxia in FC patients. Thus, we propose that SPG7 mutations explain a significant proportion of FC spastic ataxia cases and that this gene should be considered in unresolved patients.

CareRare Consortium	DNM1L-related mitochondrial fission defect presenting as refractory epilepsy	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF HUMAN GENETICS			English	Article							NEURONS; MUTATIONS; DIVISION; DYNAMICS; CELLS; DRP1	Mitochondrial fission and fusion are dynamic processes vital to mitochondrial quality control and the maintenance of cellular respiration. In dividing mitochondria, membrane scission is accomplished by a dynamin-related GTPase, DNM1L, that oligomerizes at the site of fission and constricts in a GTP-dependent manner. There is only a single previous report of DNM1L-related clinical disease: a female neonate with encephalopathy due to defective mitochondrial and peroxisomal fission (EMPF; OMIM #614388), a lethal disorder characterized by cerebral dysgenesis, seizures, lactic acidosis, elevated very long chain fatty acids, and abnormally elongated mitochondria and peroxisomes. Here, we describe a second individual, diagnosed via whole-exome sequencing, who presented with developmental delay, refractory epilepsy, prolonged survival, and no evidence of mitochondrial or peroxisomal dysfunction on standard screening investigations in blood and urine. EEG was nonspecific, showing background slowing with frequent epileptiform activity at the frontal and central head regions. Electron microscopy of skeletal muscle showed subtle, nonspecific abnormalities of cristal organization, and confocal microscopy of patient fibroblasts showed striking hyperfusion of the mitochondrial network. A panel of further bioenergetic studies in patient fibroblasts showed no significant differences versus controls. The proband's de novo DNM1L variant, NM_012062.4:c.1085G>A; NP_036192.2:p. (Gly362Asp), falls within the middle ( oligomerization) domain of DNM1L, implying a likely dominant-negative mechanism. This disorder, which presents nonspecifically and affords few diagnostic clues, can be diagnosed by means of DNM1L sequencing and/or confocal microscopy.

Biallelic mismatch repair deficiency (bMMRD) is a highly penetrant childhood cancer syndrome often resulting in GBM characterized by a high mutational burden. Evidence suggests that high mutation and neoantigen loads are associated with response to immune checkpoint inhibition. Patients and Methods We performed exome sequencing and neoantigen prediction on 37 bMMRD cancers and compared them with childhood and adult brain neoplasms. Neoantigen prediction bMMRD GBM was compared with responsive adult cancers from multiple tissues. Two siblings with recurrent multifocal bMMRD GBM were treated with the immune checkpoint inhibitor nivolumab. Results All malignant tumors (n = 32) were hypermutant. Although bMMRD brain tumors had the highest mutational load because of secondary polymerase mutations (mean, 17,740 +/- standard deviation, 7,703), all other high-grade tumors were hypermutant (mean, 1,589 +/- standard deviation, 1,043), similar to other cancers that responded favorably to immune checkpoint inhibitors. bMMRD GBM had a significantly higher mutational load than sporadic pediatric and adult gliomas and all other brain tumors (P < .001). bMMRD GBM harbored mean neoantigen loads seven to 16 times higher than those in immunoresponsive melanomas, lung cancers, or microsatellite-unstable GI cancers (P < .001). On the basis of these preclinical data, we treated two bMMRD siblings with recurrent multifocal GBM with the anti-programmed death-1 inhibitor nivolumab, which resulted in clinically significant responses and a profound radiologic response. Conclusion This report of initial and durable responses of recurrent GBM to immune checkpoint inhibition may have implications for GBM in general and other hypermutant cancers arising from primary (genetic predisposition) or secondary MMRD.

Its diagnosis mainly relies on the characterization of a wide range of symptoms including changes in mood and behavior. Despite the availability of antidepressant drugs, 10 to 30 % of patients fail to respond after a single or multiple treatments, and the recurrence of depression among responsive patients is very high. Evidence from the past decades suggests that the brain neurotransmitter serotonin (5-HT) is incriminated in MDD, and that a dysfunction of 5-HT receptors may play a role in the genesis of this disease. The 5-HT membrane transporter protein (SERT), which helps regulate the serotonergic transmission, is also implicated in MDD and is one of the main targets of antidepressant therapy. Although a number of behavioral tests and animal models have been developed to study depression, little is known about the neurobiological bases of MDD. Understanding the role of the serotonergic pathway will significantly help improve our knowledge of the pathophysiology of depression and may open up avenues for the development of new antidepressant drugs. The overarching goal of this review is to present recent findings from studies examining the serotonergic pathway in MDD, with a focus on SERT and the serotonin 1A (5-HT1A), serotonin 1B (5-HT1B), and serotonin 2A (5-HT2A) receptors. This paper also describes some of the main molecules involved in the internalization of 5-HT receptors and illustrates the changes in 5-HT neurotransmission in knockout mice and animal model of depression.

Distinct regional variations in the timelines of maturational events (synaptogenesis and synaptic pruning) occurring at the synaptic level are reflected in brain measures at macroscopic resolution (cortical thickness and gray matter density). Interestingly, the observed brain changes coincide with cognitive milestones suggesting that the changing scaffold of brain circuits may subserve cognitive development. Recent advances in connectivity analysis propelled by graph theory have allowed, on one hand, the investigation of maturational changes in global organization of structural and functional brain networks; and on the other hand, the exploration of specific networks within the context of global brain networks. An emerging picture from several connectivity studies is a system-level rewiring that constantly refines the connectivity of the developing brain. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Among them, connector hubs are of great interests, as they are assumed to promote global and hierarchical communications between functionally specialized networks. Damage to connector hubs may have a more crucial effect on the system than does damage to other hubs. Hubs in graph theory are often identified from a correlation matrix, and classified as connector hubs when the hubs are more connected to regions in other networks than within the networks to which they belong. However, the identification of hubs from functional data is more complex than that from structural data, notably because of the inherent problem of multicollinearity between temporal dynamics within a functional network. In this context, we developed and validated a method to reliably identify connectors and corresponding overlapping network structure from resting-state fMRI. This new method is actually handling the multicollinearity issue, since it does not rely on counting the number of connections from a thresholded correlation matrix. The novelty of the proposed method is that besides counting the number of networks involved in each voxel, it allows us to identify which networks are actually involved in each voxel, using a data-driven sparse general linear model in order to identify brain regions involved in more than one network. Moreover, we added a bootstrap resampling strategy to assess statistically the reproducibility of our results at the single subject level. The unified framework is called SPARK, i.e. SParsity-based Analysis of Reliable k-hubness, where k-hubness denotes the number of networks overlapping in each voxel. The accuracy and robustness of SPARK were evaluated using two dimensional box simulations and realistic simulations that examined detection of artificial hubs generated on real data. Then, test/retest reliability of the method was assessed using the 1000 Functional Connectome Project database, which includes data obtained from 25 healthy subjects at three different occasions with long and short intervals between sessions. We demonstrated that SPARK provides an accurate and reliable estimation of k-hubness, suggesting a promising tool for understanding hub organization in resting-state fMRI. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

We used fMRI to characterize brain responses to in-depth, laterally moving, and static sounds in early blind and sighted individuals. Whole-brain univariate analyses revealed that the right posterior middle temporal gyrus and superior occipital gyrus selectively responded to both in-depth and laterally moving sounds only in the blind. These regions overlapped with regions selective for visual motion (hMT+/V5 and V3A) that were independently localized in the sighted. In the early blind, the right planum temporale showed enhanced functional connectivity with right occipito-temporal regions during auditory motion processing and a concomitant reduced functional connectivity with parietal and frontal regions. Whole-brain searchlight multivariate analyses demonstrated higher auditory motion decoding in the right posterior middle temporal gyrus in the blind compared to the sighted, while decoding accuracy was enhanced in the auditory cortex bilaterally in the sighted compared to the blind. Analyses targeting individually defined visual area hMT+/V5 however indicated that auditory motion information could be reliably decoded within this area even in the sighted group. Taken together, the present findings demonstrate that early visual deprivation triggers a large-scale imbalance between auditory and "visual" brain regions that typically support the processing of motion information.

The purpose of this study was to measure the TOF responses after PTC in one hand and to compare the responses with those in the contralateral (control) hand. Twenty-two adult patients undergoing elective surgery under opioid-desflurane anesthesia were fitted with sensors to measure displacement of their thumbs in response to ulnar nerve stimulation. Rocuronium 0.6 mg center dot kg(-1) was administered and TOF stimulation was applied to both sides. One side was randomized to PTC (50-Hz tetanus followed by a three-second pause and 15 1-Hz stimuli) when the opposite (control) side recovered to 10% first twitch (T1) height. Train-of-four stimulation was continued bilaterally every 20 sec until 30 min after PTC. Comparisons of the T1 and TOF ratio (T4/T1) were made at two, five, ten, 20, and 30 min. The mean (standard deviation [SD]) T1 value in the PTC arm was 11.8 (7.1)% just before PTC. The T1 values were significantly greater in the PTC arm at two, five, and ten minutes, with mean (SD) differences of 6.3 (6.7)%, 9.4 (6.8)%, and 7.4 (3.9)%, respectively (P = 0.008). There were no significant differences in T1 values between groups at 20 and 30 min, and no statistically significant differences in T4/T1 values at any time. A small but clinically insignificant increase in T1 is seen for at least ten minutes after PTC without any detectable change in T4/T1 values. The TOF responses are reliable as early as one minute after PTC.

Eighty seven people with 1-3 brain metastases (54/87 lung primary, 42/87 single brain metastases) were enrolled on this Phase II trial of WBRT (30 Gy/10) + simultaneous FSRT, (60 Gy/10). Median overall follow-up and survival was 5.4 months, 6 month actuarial intra-lesional control was 78 %; only 1 patient exhibited grade 4 toxicity (worsened seizures); most treatment related toxicity was grade 1 or 2; 2/87 patients demonstrated asymptomatic radiation necrosis on follow-up imaging. Mean (Min-Max) baseline KPS, Mini Mental Status Exam (MMSE) and FACT-BR quality of life were 83 (70-100), 28 (21-30) and 143 (98-153). Lower baseline MMSE (but not KPS or FACT-Br) was associated with worse survival after adjusting for age, number of metastases, primary and extra-cranial disease status. Crude rates of deterioration (> 10 points decrease from baseline for KPS and FACT-Br, MMSE fall to < 27) ranged from 26 to 38 % for KPS, 32-59 % for FACT-Br and 0-16 % for MMSE depending on the time-point assessed with higher rates generally noted at earlier time points (a parts per thousand currency sign6 months post-treatment). Using a linear mixed models analysis, significant declines from baseline were noted for KPS and FACT-Br (largest effects at 6 weeks to 3 months) with no significant change in MMSE. The effects on function and quality of life of this integrated treatment of WBRT + simultaneous FSRT were similar to other published series combining WBRT + radiosurgery.

Midlife adiposity predicts earlier onset of Alzheimer's dementia, neuropathology and presymptomatic cerebral amyloid accumulation	MOLECULAR PSYCHIATRY			English	Article							BODY-MASS INDEX; MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; OLDER-ADULTS; LATE-LIFE; MEDITERRANEAN DIET; GLOBAL BURDEN; RISK-FACTOR; AGING BLSA; DISEASE; OBESITY	Understanding how midlife risk factors influence age at onset (AAO) of Alzheimer's disease (AD) may provide clues to delay disease expression. Although midlife adiposity predicts increased incidence of AD, it is unclear whether it affects AAO and severity of Alzheimer's neuropathology. Using a prospective population-based cohort, Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA), this study aims to examine the relationships between midlife body mass index (BMI) and (1) AAO of AD (2) severity of Alzheimer's neuropathology and (3) fibrillar brain amyloid deposition during aging. We analyzed data on 1394 cognitively normal individuals at baseline (8643 visits; average follow-up interval 13.9 years), among whom 142 participants developed incident AD. In two subsamples of BLSA, 191 participants underwent autopsy and neuropathological assessment, and 75 non-demented individuals underwent brain amyloid imaging. Midlife adiposity was derived from BMI data at 50 years of age. We find that each unit increase in midlife BMI predicts earlier onset of AD by 6.7 months (P = 0.013). Higher midlife BMI was associated with greater Braak neurofibrillary but not CERAD (Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease) neuritic plaque scores at autopsy overall. Associations between midlife BMI and brain amyloid burden approached statistical significance. Thus, higher midlife BMI was also associated with greater fibrillar amyloid measured by global mean cortical distribution volume ratio (P = 0.075) and within the precuneus (left, P = 0.061; right, P = 0.079). In conclusion, midlife overweight predicts earlier onset of AD and greater burden of Alzheimer's neuropathology. A healthy BMI at midlife may delay the onset of AD.

Genetic and functional analyses demonstrate a role for abnormal glycinergic signaling in autism	MOLECULAR PSYCHIATRY			English	Article							CORTICAL INTERNEURON MIGRATION; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; SPECTRUM DISORDERS; RECOGNITION MEMORY; HYPEREKPLEXIA MUTATIONS; RECEPTOR ACTIVATION; NEURONAL MIGRATION; PERIRHINAL CORTEX; FRAGILE-X; GABA	Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a common neurodevelopmental condition characterized by marked genetic heterogeneity. Recent studies of rare structural and sequence variants have identified hundreds of loci involved in ASD, but our knowledge of the overall genetic architecture and the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms remains incomplete. Glycine receptors (GlyRs) are ligand-gated chloride channels that mediate inhibitory neurotransmission in the adult nervous system but exert an excitatory action in immature neurons. GlyRs containing the alpha 2 subunit are highly expressed in the embryonic brain, where they promote cortical interneuron migration and the generation of excitatory projection neurons. We previously identified a rare microdeletion of the X-linked gene GLRA2, encoding the GlyR a2 subunit, in a boy with autism. The microdeletion removes the terminal exons of the gene (GLRA2(Delta ex8-9)). Here, we sequenced 400 males with ASD and identified one de novo missense mutation, p.R153Q, absent from controls. In vitro functional analysis demonstrated that the GLRA2(Delta ex8-9) protein failed to localize to the cell membrane, while the R153Q mutation impaired surface expression and markedly reduced sensitivity to glycine. Very recently, an additional de novo missense mutation (p.N136S) was reported in a boy with ASD, and we show that this mutation also reduced cell-surface expression and glycine sensitivity. Targeted glra2 knockdown in zebrafish induced severe axon-branching defects, rescued by injection of wild type but not GLRA2(Delta ex8-9) or R153Q transcripts, providing further evidence for their loss-of-function effect. Glra2 knockout mice exhibited deficits in object recognition memory and impaired long-term potentiation in the prefrontal cortex. Taken together, these results implicate GLRA2 in non-syndromic ASD, unveil a novel role for GLRA2 in synaptic plasticity and learning and memory, and link altered glycinergic signaling to social and cognitive impairments.

Specifically, SCA patients had difficulties postponing their motor response while estimating the target kinematics. This behavioral difference relied on the activation of both cerebellum and striatum in healthy controls, but not in cerebellar patients, despite both groups activating certain parts of cerebellum during the task. However, the role of these two key structures in the dynamic adaptation of the motor timing to target kinematic properties remained unexplored. In the current paper, we analyzed these data with the aim of characterizing the trial-by-trial changes in brain activation. We found that in healthy controls alone, and in comparison with SCA patients, the activation in bilateral striatum was exclusively associated with past successes and that in the left putamen, with maintaining a successful performance across successive trials. In healthy controls, relative to SCA patients, a larger network was involved in maintaining a successful trial-by-trial strategy; this included cerebellum and fronto-parieto-temporo-occipital regions that are typically part of attentional network and action monitoring. Cerebellum was also part of a network of regions activated when healthy participants postponed their motor response from one trial to the next; SCA patients showed reduced activation relative to healthy controls in both cerebellum and striatum in the same contrast. These findings support the idea that cerebellum and striatum play complementary roles in the trial-by-trial adaptation in predictive motor timing. In addition to expanding our knowledge of brain structures involved in time processing, our results have implications for the understanding of BG disorders, such as Parkinson disease where feedback processing or reward learning is affected.

Glioblastomas are highly vascularized tumors with a prominent infiltration of macrophages/microglia whose role in promoting glioma growth, invasion, and angiogenesis has not been fully elucidated. Methods. The contribution of myeloid-derived vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) to glioma growth was analyzed in vivo in a syngeneic intracranial GL261 glioma model using a Cre/loxP system to knock out the expression of VEGF-A in CD11b + myeloid cells. Changes in angiogenesis-related gene expression profile were analyzed in mutant bone marrow-derived (BMD) macrophages in vitro. Furthermore, we studied the influence of macrophages on GL261 growth, invasiveness, and protein expression profile of angiogenic molecules as well as the paracrine effect of mutant macrophages on angiogenesis in vitro. Results. Myeloid cell-restricted VEGF-A deficiency leads to a growth delay of intracranial tumors and prolonged survival. The tumor vasculature in mutant mice was more regular, with increased pericyte coverage. Expression analysis revealed significant down-regulation of VEGF-A and slight upregulation of TGF beta-1 in BMD macrophages from mutant mice. Endothelial tube formation was significantly decreased by conditioned media from mutant macrophages. The expression of angiogenesis-related proteins in GL261 glioma cells in co-culture experiments either with wild-type or mutant macrophages remained unchanged, indicating that effects observed in vivo are due to myeloid-derived VEGF-A deficiency. Conclusions. Our results highlight the importance of VEGF derived from tumor-infiltrating myeloid cells for initiating vascularization in gliomas. The combination of antiangiogenic agents with myeloid cell-targeting strategies might provide a new therapeutic approach for glioblastoma patients.

Since small Mn particles may be carried for long distances, we measured manganese (Mn) and lead (Pb) dust fall accumulation in 15 elementary schools, located between 1.25 and 6.48 km from the plant in the municipality of Simoes Filho, Bahia, Brazil. Passive samplers (polyethylene Petri dishes) were set in interior and exterior environments. After 30 days, the samplers' content was solubilized with diluted nitric acid and Mn and Pb levels were analyzed by electrothermal absorption spectrometry. The overall geometric mean and range of Mn and Pb accumulation in dust fall (loading rates) were 1582 jig Mn/m(2)/30 days (37-37,967) and 43.2 mu g Pb/m(2)/30 days (2.9-210.4). A logarithmic decrease in interior and exterior Mn loading rates was observed with distance from the ferro-manganese alloy plant. Multiple regression analyses of log-transformed Mn loading rate within the schools showed a positive association with Mn levels in outdoor dust, a negative association with distance from the plant; as well, wind direction (downwind > upwind) and school location (urban > rural) entered significantly into the model. For the interior school environments, located within a 2-km radius from the plant, loading rate was, on average, 190 times higher than the Mn levels reported by Gulson et al., (2014) in daycare centers in Sydney, Australia, using a similar method. Pb loading rates were not associated with distance from the plant and were lower than the rates observed in the same daycare centers in Sydney. Our findings suggest that a significant portion of the children in this town in Brazil may be exposed to airborne Mn at concentrations that may affect their neurodevelopment. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Patients with temporal lobe epilepsy and a history of atypical febrile seizures often carry a cortical malformation. This association has led to the hypothesis that the presence of a cortical dysplasia exacerbates febrile seizures in infancy, in turn increasing the risk for neurological sequelae. The mechanisms linking these events are currently poorly understood. Potassium-chloride cotransporter KCC2 affects several aspects of neuronal circuit development and function, by modulating GABAergic transmission and excitatory synapse formation. Recent data suggest that KCC2 downregulation contributes to seizure generation in the epileptic adult brain, but its role in the developing brain is still controversial. In a rodent model of atypical febrile seizures, combining a cortical dysplasia and hyperthermia-induced seizures (LHS rats), we found a premature and sustained increase in KCC2 protein levels, accompanied by a negative shift of the reversal potential of GABA. In parallel, we observed a significant reduction in dendritic spine size and mEPSC amplitude in CA1 pyramidal neurons, accompanied by spatial memory deficits. To investigate whether KCC2 premature overexpression plays a role in seizure susceptibility and synaptic alterations, we reduced KCC2 expression selectively in hippocampal pyramidal neurons by in utero electroporation of shRNA. Remarkably, KCC2 shRNA-electroporated LHS rats show reduced hyperthermia-induced seizure susceptibility, while dendritic spine size deficits were rescued. Our findings demonstrate that KCC2 overexpression in a compromised developing brain increases febrile seizure susceptibility and contribute to dendritic spine alterations.

In this study, we examined the roles of T cell ephrinB1 (EFNB1) and ephrinB2 (EFNB2) in the pathogenesis of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) and MS. We provide evidence that animals with T cell specific double deletion of EFNB1 and EFNB2 (dKO) have reduced proliferation in response to MOG(35-55), defective Th1 and Th17 differentiations and significantly lower scores of MOG-induced EAE. We further demonstrate that dKO T cells are compromised in their ability to migrate into the CNS of EAE animals in vivo and towards multiple chemokines in vitro. Using deletion mutations, we identified a critical 11-aa EFNB1 intracellular domain segment that controls T cell chemotaxis towards CCL21. In humans, EFNB1 and EFNB2 are highly expressed in Th1 and Th17 cells and EFNB1- and EFNB2-expressing T cells are found among immune cell infiltrates in MS lesions. Reverse signaling through EFNB1 and EFNB2 in human Th17 cells enhances their migration through a monolayer of blood brain barrier endothelial cells. Our study demonstrates that expression of EFNB1 and EFNB2 is implicated in Th cell differentiation and migration to inflammatory sites in both EAE and MS. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Epilepsy, Antiepileptic Drugs, and Aggression: An Evidence-Based Review	PHARMACOLOGICAL REVIEWS			English	Review							TEMPORAL-LOBE EPILEPSY; PARTIAL-ONSET SEIZURES; PSYCHIATRIC ADVERSE EVENTS; PLACEBO-CONTROLLED TRIAL; LENNOX-GASTAUT SYNDROME; INTERICTAL DYSPHORIC DISORDER; EPISODIC DYSCONTROL SYNDROME; REFRACTORY PARTIAL SEIZURES; CONTROLLED CLINICAL-TRIAL; GAMMA-AMINOBUTYRIC-ACID	Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) have many benefits but also many side effects, including aggression, agitation, and irritability, in some patients with epilepsy. This article offers a comprehensive summary of current understanding of aggressive behaviors in patients with epilepsy, including an evidence-based review of aggression during AED treatment. Aggression is seen in a minority of people with epilepsy. It is rarely seizure related but is interictal, sometimes occurring as part of complex psychiatric and behavioral comorbidities, and it is sometimes associated with AED treatment. We review the common neurotransmitter systems and brain regions implicated in both epilepsy and aggression, including the GABA, glutamate, serotonin, dopamine, and noradrenaline systems and the hippocampus, amygdala, prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, and temporal lobes. Few controlled clinical studies have used behavioral measures to specifically examine aggression with AEDs, and most evidence comes from adverse event reporting from clinical and observational studies. A systematic approach was used to identify relevant publications, and we present a comprehensive, evidence-based summary of available data surrounding aggression-related behaviors with each of the currently available AEDs in both adults and in children/adolescents with epilepsy. A psychiatric history and history of a propensity toward aggression/anger should routinely be sought from patients, family members, and carers; its presence does not preclude the use of any specific AEDs, but those most likely to be implicated in these behaviors should be used with caution in such cases.

DNA methylation signature of human fetal alcohol spectrum disorder	EPIGENETICS & CHROMATIN			English	Article							EPIGENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION; CPG ISLAND SHORES; GENE-EXPRESSION; BRAIN TRANSCRIPTOME; HUMAN GENOME; DATA SETS; EXPOSURE; EPIGENETICS; CONSUMPTION; ADULT	Background: Prenatal alcohol exposure is the leading preventable cause of behavioral and cognitive deficits, which may affect between 2 and 5 % of children in North America. While the underlying mechanisms of alcohol's effects on development remain relatively unknown, emerging evidence implicates epigenetic mechanisms in mediating the range of symptoms observed in children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD). Thus, we investigated the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on genome-wide DNA methylation in the NeuroDevNet FASD cohort, the largest cohort of human FASD samples to date. Methods: Genome-wide DNA methylation patterns of buccal epithelial cells (BECs) were analyzed using the Illumina HumanMethylation450 array in a Canadian cohort of 206 children (110 FASD and 96 controls). Genotyping was performed in parallel using the Infinium HumanOmni2.5-Quad v1.0 BeadChip. Results: After correcting for the effects of genetic background, we found 658 significantly differentially methylated sites between FASD cases and controls, with 41 displaying differences in percent methylation change >5 %. Furthermore, 101 differentially methylated regions containing two or more CpGs were also identified, overlapping with 95 different genes. The majority of differentially methylated genes were highly expressed at the level of mRNA in brain samples from the Allen Brain Atlas, and independent DNA methylation data from cortical brain samples showed high correlations with BEC DNA methylation patterns. Finally, overrepresentation analysis of genes with up-methylated CpGs revealed a significant enrichment for neurodevelopmental processes and diseases, such as anxiety, epilepsy, and autism spectrum disorders. Conclusions: These findings suggested that prenatal alcohol exposure is associated with distinct DNA methylation patterns in children and adolescents, raising the possibility of an epigenetic biomarker of FASD.

Disentangling the autism - anxiety overlap: fMRI of reward processing in a community-based longitudinal study	TRANSLATIONAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Article							EVENT-RELATED FMRI; WELL-BEING ASSESSMENT; SPECTRUM DISORDERS; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; PSYCHIATRIC-DISORDERS; RESPONSE-INHIBITION; NEURAL MECHANISMS; COGNITIVE CONTROL; DECISION-MAKING; TWIN SAMPLE	Up to 40% of youth with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) also suffer from anxiety, and this comorbidity is linked with significant functional impairment. However, the mechanisms of this overlap are poorly understood. We investigated the interplay between ASD traits and anxiety during reward processing, known to be affected in ASD, in a community sample of 1472 adolescents (mean age = 14.4 years) who performed a modified monetary incentive delay task as part of the Imagen project. Blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) responses to reward anticipation and feedback were compared using a 2x2 analysis of variance test (ASD traits: low/high; anxiety symptoms: low/high), controlling for plausible covariates. In addition, we used a longitudinal design to assess whether neural responses during reward processing predicted anxiety at 2-year follow-up. High ASD traits were associated with reduced BOLD responses in dorsal prefrontal regions during reward anticipation and negative feedback. Participants with high anxiety symptoms showed increased lateral prefrontal responses during anticipation, but decreased responses following feedback. Interaction effects revealed that youth with combined ASD traits and anxiety, relative to other youth, showed high right insula activation when anticipating reward, and low right-sided caudate, putamen, medial and lateral prefrontal activations during negative feedback (all clusters P-FWE < 0.05). BOLD activation patterns in the right dorsal cingulate and right medial frontal gyrus predicted new-onset anxiety in participants with high but not low ASD traits. Our results reveal both quantitatively enhanced and qualitatively distinct neural correlates underlying the comorbidity between ASD traits and anxiety. Specific neural responses during reward processing may represent a risk factor for developing anxiety in ASD youth.

While MI has been shown to influence the early stages of the learning process, recent data revealed that sleep also contributes to the consolidation of the memory trace. How such "online" and "offline" processes take place and how they interact to impact the neural underpinnings of movements has received little attention. The aim of the present review is twofold: (i) providing an overview of recent applied and fundamental studies investigating the effects of MI practice (MIP) on motor learning: and (ii) detangling applied and fundamental findings in support of a sleep contribution to motor consolidation after MIP. We conclude with an integrative approach of online and offline learning resulting from intense MIP in healthy participants, and underline research avenues in the motor learning/clinical domains.

However, decades of such research have not effectively translated into substantial therapeutic success for human patients. Here we critically discuss these issues in order to determine how existing human-based methods can be applied to study AD pathology and develop novel therapeutics. These methods, which include patient-derived cells, computational analysis and models, together with large-scale epidemiological studies represent novel and exciting tools to enhance and forward AD research. In particular, these methods are helping advance AD research by contributing multifactorial and multidimensional perspectives, especially considering the crucial role played by lifestyle risk factors in the determination of AD risk. In addition to research techniques, we also consider related pitfalls and flaws in the current research funding system. Conversely, we identify encouraging new trends in research and government policy. In light of these new research directions, we provide recommendations regarding prioritization of research funding. The goal of this document is to stimulate scientific and public discussion on the need to explore new avenues in AD research, considering outcome and ethics as core principles to reliably judge traditional research efforts and eventually undertake new research strategies.

Adaptation to second order stimulus features by electrosensory neurons causes ambiguity	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							WEAKLY ELECTRIC FISH; LATERAL-LINE LOBE; RECEPTIVE-FIELD ORGANIZATION; APTERONOTUS-LEPTORHYNCHUS; DIRECTIONAL SELECTIVITY; REDUNDANCY REDUCTION; SENSORY ADAPTATION; NATURAL STIMULI; NEURAL CODE; TIME-COURSE	Understanding the coding strategies used to process sensory input remains a central problem in neuroscience. Growing evidence suggests that sensory systems process natural stimuli efficiently by ensuring a close match between neural tuning and stimulus statistics through adaptation. However, adaptation causes ambiguity as the same response can be elicited by different stimuli. The mechanisms by which the brain resolves ambiguity remain poorly understood. Here we investigated adaptation in electrosensory pyramidal neurons within different parallel maps in the weakly electric fish Apteronotus leptorhynchus. In response to step increases in stimulus variance, we found that pyramidal neurons within the lateral segment (LS) displayed strong scale invariant adaptation whereas those within the centromedial segment (CMS) instead displayed weaker degrees of scale invariant adaptation. Signal detection analysis revealed that strong adaptation in LS neurons significantly reduced stimulus discriminability. In contrast, weaker adaptation displayed by CMS neurons led to significantly lesser impairment of discriminability. Thus, while LS neurons display adaptation that is matched to natural scene statistics, thereby optimizing information transmission, CMS neurons instead display weaker adaptation and would instead provide information about the context in which these statistics occur. We propose that such a scheme is necessary for decoding by higher brain structures.

J	Dotov, DG; Bardy, BG; Dalla Bella, S				Dotov, Dobromir G.; Bardy, Benoit G.; Dalla Bella, Simone			The role of environmental constraints in walking: Effects of steering and sharp turns on gait dynamics	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							LONG-RANGE CORRELATIONS; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; FRACTAL DYNAMICS; STRIDE INTERVAL; SPEED INFLUENCES; LEVEL WALKING; FLUCTUATIONS; PHYSIOLOGY; COMPLEXITY; PENDULUM	Stride durations in gait exhibit long-range correlation (LRC) which tends to disappear with certain movement disorders. The loss of LRC has been hypothesized to result from a reduction of functional degrees of freedom of the neuromuscular apparatus. A consequence of this theory is that environmental constraints such as the ones induced during constant steering may also reduce LRC. Furthermore, obstacles may perturb control of the gait cycle and also reduce LRC. To test these predictions, seven healthy participants walked freely overground in three conditions: unconstrained, constrained (constant steering), and perturbed (frequent 90 degrees turns). Both steering and sharp turning reduced LRC with the latter having a stronger effect. Competing theories explain LRC in gait by positing fractal CPGs or a biomechanical process of kinetic energy reuse. Mediation analysis showed that the effect of the experimental manipulation in the current experiment depends partly on a reduction in walking speed. This supports the biomechanical theory. We also found that the local Hurst exponent did not reflect the frequent changes of heading direction. This suggests that the recovery from the sharp turn perturbation, a kind of relaxation time, takes longer than the four to seven meters between successive turns in the present study.

Frequently, researchers utilize post-mortem tissue with the assumption that post-mortem tissue decay has little or no effect on epigenetic marks. Although previous studies show no effect of post-mortem interval on certain epigenetic marks, no such research has been performed on cytosine modifications. In this study, we use DNA from the brains of adult Sprague Dawley rats subjected to post-mortem intervals at room temperature, ranging from 0 to 96 h, to assess the stability of cytosine modifications, namely 5-methycytosine and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine. Our results indicate that neither global nor site-specific levels of 5-methycytosine and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine are affected by the post-mortem intervals we studied. As such, the use of post-mortem tissue to study cytosine modifications in the context of neurological or neuropsychiatric disorders is appropriate.

Our goal was to 1) assess the repeatability and reproducibility of measurement and the influence of environment, and acclimatization, to different pain assessment outcomes in normal rats, and 2) test the concurrent validity of the most reliable methods in relation to the expression of different spinal neuropeptides in a chemical model of osteoarthritic pain. Methods: Repeatability and inter-rater reliability of reflexive nociceptive mechanical thresholds, spontaneous static weight-bearing, treadmill, rotarod, and operant place escape/avoidance paradigm (PEAP) were assessed by the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). The most reliable acclimatization protocol was determined by comparing coefficients of variation. In a pilot comparative study, the sensitivity and responsiveness to treatment of the most reliable methods were tested in the monosodium iodoacetate (MIA) model over 21 days. Two MIA (2 mg) groups (including one lidocaine treatment group) and one sham group (0.9 % saline) received an intra-articular (50 mu L) injection. Results: No effect of environment (observer, inverted circadian cycle, or exercise) was observed; all tested methods except mechanical sensitivity (ICC <0.3), offered good repeatability (ICC >= 0.7). The most reliable acclimatization protocol included five assessments over two weeks. MIA-related osteoarthritic change in pain was demonstrated with static weight-bearing, punctate tactile allodynia evaluation, treadmill exercise and operant PEAP, the latter being the most responsive to analgesic intra-articular lidocaine. Substance P and calcitonin gene-related peptide were higher in MIA groups compared to naive (adjusted P (adj-P) = 0.016) or sham-treated (adj-P = 0.029) rats. Repeated post-MIA lidocaine injection resulted in 34 times lower downregulation for spinal substance P compared to MIA alone (adj-P = 0.029), with a concomitant increase of 17 % in time spent on the PEAP dark side (indicative of increased comfort). Conclusion: This study of normal rats and rats with pain established the most reliable and sensitive pain assessment methods and an optimized acclimatization protocol. Operant PEAP testing was more responsive to lidocaine analgesia than other tests used, while neuropeptide spinal concentration is an objective quantification method attractive to support and validate different centralized pain functional assessment methods.

To better understand how theta is generated, we explored how parvalbumin (PV) and somatostatin (SOM) interneurons in CA1 stratum oriens/alveus fire during hippocampal theta and investigated synaptic mechanisms underlying their behavior. Combining the use of transgenic mice to visually identify PV and SOM interneurons and the intact hippocampal preparation that can generate theta oscillations in vitro without cholinergic agonists, we performed simultaneous field and whole-cell recordings. We found that PV interneurons uniformly fire strongly phase-locked to theta, whereas SOM neurons are more heterogeneous with only a proportion of cells displaying tight phase-locking. Differences in phase-locking strength could be explained by disparity in excitatory inputs received; PV neurons received significantly larger EPSCs compared with SOM neurons, and the degree of phase-locking in SOM neurons was significantly correlated with the size of EPSCs. In contrast, IPSC amplitude did not differ between cell types. We determined that the local CA1 rhythm plays amore dominant role in driving CA1 interneuron firing than afferent inputs from the CA3. Last, we show that PV and strongly phase-locked SOM neurons fire near the peak of CA1 theta, under the tight control of excitatory inputs that arise at a specific phase of each theta cycle. These results reveal a fundamental mechanism of neuronal phase-locking and highlight an important role of excitation from the local network in governing firing behavior during rhythmic network states.

Similarly, several functional neuroimaging studies show that schizophrenia patients have increased activations in response to neutral material. However, results are heterogeneous. Here, we review the functional neuroimaging studies that have addressed this research question. Based on the 36 functional neuroimaging studies that we retrieved, it seems that the increased brain reactivity to neutral stimuli is fairly common in schizophrenia, but that the regions involved vary considerably, apart from the amygdala. Prefrontal and cingulate sub-regions and the hippocampus may also be involved. By contrasts, results in individuals at risk for psychosis are less consistent. In schizophrenia patients, results are less consistent in the case of studies using non-facial stimuli, explicit processing paradigms, and/or event-related designs. This means that human faces may convey subtle information (e.g., trustworthiness) other than basic emotional expressions. It also means that the aberrant brain reactivity to neutral stimuli is less likely to occur when experimental paradigms are too cognitively demanding as well as in studies lacking statistical power. The main hypothesis proposed to account for this increased brain reactivity to neutral stimuli is the aberrant salience hypothesis of psychosis. Other investigators propose that the aberrant brain reactivity to neutral stimuli in schizophrenia results from abnormal associative learning, untrustworthiness judgments, priming effects, and/or reduced habituation to neutral stimuli. In the future, the effects of antipsychotics on this aberrant brain reactivity will need to be determined, as well as the potential implication of sex/gender.

The brain imaging data structure, a format for organizing and describing outputs of neuroimaging experiments	SCIENTIFIC DATA			English	Article							MANAGEMENT; PROVENANCE; STORAGE	The development of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques has defined modern neuroimaging. Since its inception, tens of thousands of studies using techniques such as functional MRI and diffusion weighted imaging have allowed for the non-invasive study of the brain. Despite the fact that MRI is routinely used to obtain data for neuroscience research, there has been no widely adopted standard for organizing and describing the data collected in an imaging experiment. This renders sharing and reusing data (within or between labs) difficult if not impossible and unnecessarily complicates the application of automatic pipelines and quality assurance protocols. To solve this problem, we have developed the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS), a standard for organizing and describing MRI datasets. The BIDS standard uses file formats compatible with existing software, unifies the majority of practices already common in the field, and captures the metadata necessary for most common data processing operations.

This process, known as repetition suppression (RS), is involved in the acquisition of familiarity. Current models suggest that RS results from interactions between visual information processing areas located in the occipito-temporal cortex and higher order areas, such as the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Brain signal complexity, which reflects information dynamics of cortical networks, has been shown to increase as unfamiliar faces become familiar. However, the complementarity of RS and increases in brain signal complexity have yet to be demonstrated within the same measurements. We hypothesized that RS and brain signal complexity increase occur simultaneously during learning of unfamiliar faces. Further, we expected alteration of DLPFC function by transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to modulate RS and brain signal complexity over the occipito-temporal cortex. Participants underwent three tDCS conditions in random order: right anodal/left cathodal, right cathodal/left anodal and sham. Following tDCS, participants learned unfamiliar faces, while an electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded. Results revealed RS over occipito-temporal electrode sites during learning, reflected by a decrease in signal energy, a measure of amplitude. Simultaneously, as signal energy decreased, brain signal complexity, as estimated with multiscale entropy (MSE), increased. In addition, prefrontal tDCS modulated brain signal complexity over the right occipitotemporal cortex during the first presentation of faces. These results suggest that although RS may reflect a brain mechanism essential to learning, complementary processes reflected by increases in brain signal complexity, may be instrumental in the acquisition of novel visual information. Such processes likely involve long-range coordinated activity between prefrontal and lower order visual areas. (C) 2016 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Our prior study showed that PGE2 or EP4 agonist stimulates EP4 externalization and this event was not only suppressed by the inhibitor of anterograde export, but also by the recycling inhibitor (St-Jacques and Ma, 2013). These data suggest that EP4 recycling also contributes to agonist-enhanced EP4 surface abundance. In the current study, we tested this hypothesis using antibody-feeding-based internalization assay, recycling assay and FITC-PGE2 binding assay. We observed that selective EP4 agonist 1-hydroxy-PGE1 (1-0H-PGE1) or CAY10850 time- and concentration dependently increased EP4 internalization in cultured DRG neuron. Internalized EP4 was predominantly localized in the early endosomes and recycling endosomes, but rarely in the late endosomes and lysosomes. These observations were confirmed by FITC-PGE2 binding assay. We further revealed that 1-0H-PGE1 or CAY10850 time- and concentration-dependently increased EP4 recycling. Double exposures to 1-0H-PGE1 induced a greater increase in calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) release than a single exposure or vehicle exposure, an event blocked by pre-treatment with the recycling inhibitor monensin. Our data suggest that EP4 recycling contributes to agonist-induced cell surface abundance and consequently enhanced receptor sensitivity. Facilitating EP4 externalization and recycling is a novel mechanism underlying PGE2-induced nociceptor sensitization. (C) 2016 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This trajectory allows postnatal experiences to refine the wiring, which may manifest as endophenotypic changes in cortical gyrification. Diving experts, typical elite athletes who commence intensive motor training at a very young age in their early childhood, serve ideal models for examining the gyrification changes related to long-term intensive diving training. Using local gyrification index (LGI), we compared the cortical gyrification between 12 diving experts and 12 controls. Compared with controls, diving experts showed widespread LGI reductions in regions relevant to diving performance. Negative correlations between LGIs and years of diving training were also observed in diving experts. Further exploratory network efficiency analysis of structural cortical networks, inferred from interregional correlation of LGIs, revealed comparable global and local efficiency in diving experts relative to controls. These findings suggest that gyrification reductions in diving experts may be the result of long-term diving training which could refine the neural circuitry (via synaptic pruning) and might be the anatomical substrate underlying their extraordinary diving performance.

They are non-replicative particles that mimic the morphology of native viruses which make them more immunogenic than classical subunit vaccines. In this study, we propose HEK-293 cells in suspension culture in serum free medium as an efficient platform to produce large quantities of VLPs. For this purpose, a stable cell line expressing the main influenza viral antigens hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) (subtype H1N1) under the regulation of a cumate inducible promoter was developed (293HA-NA cells). The production of VLPs was evaluated by transient transfection of plasmids encoding human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) Gag or M1 influenza matrix protein. To facilitate the monitoring of VLPs production, Gag was fused to the green fluorescence protein (GFP). The transient transfection of the gag containing plasmid in 293HA-NA cells increased the release of HA and NA seven times more than its counterpart transfected with the M1 encoding plasmid. Consequently, the production of HA-NA containing VLPs using Gag as scaffold was evaluated in a 3-L controlled stirred tank bioreactor. The VLPs secreted in the culture medium were recovered by ultracentrifugation on a sucrose cushion and ultrafiltered by tangential flow filtration. Transmission electron micrographs of final sample revealed the presence of particles with the average typical size (150-200 nm) and morphology of HIV-1 immature particles. The concentration of the influenza glycoproteins on the Gag-VLPs was estimated by single radial immunodiffusion and hemagglutination assay for HA and by Dot-Blot for HA and NA. More significantly, intranasal immunization of mice with influenza Gag-VLPs induced strong antigen-specific mucosal and systemic antibody responses and provided full protection against a lethal intranasal challenge with the homologous virus strain. These data suggest that, with further optimization and characterization the process could support mass production of safer and better-controlled VLPs-based influenza vaccine candidate.

The ribosomal initiation complex is assembled on the mRNA via a cap-dependent or cap-independent mechanism. We describe various mechanisms controlling ribosome scanning and initiation codon selection by 5' upstream open reading frames, translation initiation factors, and primary and secondary structures of the 5' UTR, including particular sequence motifs. We also discuss translational control via phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2, which is implicated in learning and memory, neurodegenerative diseases, and cancer.

Similarly, in the context of neurodegenerative conditions, neuroimaging reveals that cognitive decline is linked to the magnitude of atrophy, neurochemical declines, or concentrations of abnormal protein aggregates across brain regions. However, modeling the effects of multiple regional abnormalities as determinants of cognitive decline at the voxel level remains largely unexplored by multimodal imaging research, given the high computational cost of estimating regression models for every single voxel from various imaging modalities. VoxelStats is a voxel-wise computational framework to overcome these computational limitations and to perform statistical operations on multiple scalar variables and imaging modalities at the voxel level. VoxelStats package has been developed in Matlab (R) and supports imaging formats such as Nifti-1, ANALYZE, and MINC v2. Prebuilt functions in VoxelStats enable the user to perform voxel-wise general and generalized linear models and mixed effect models with multiple volumetric covariates. Importantly, VoxelStats can recognize scalar values or image volumes as response variables and can accommodate volumetric statistical covariates as well as their interaction effects with other variables. Furthermore, this package includes built-in functionality to perform voxel-wise receiver operating characteristic analysis and paired and unpaired group contrast analysis. Validation of VoxelStats was conducted by comparing the linear regression functionality with existing toolboxes such as glim_image and RMINC. The validation results were identical to existing methods and the additional functionality was demonstrated by generating feature case assessments (t-statistics, odds ratio, and true positive rate maps). In summary, VoxelStats expands the current methods for multimodal imaging analysis by allowing the estimation of advanced regional association metrics at the voxel level.

While considerable progress has been made to define molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the maintenance of axon ensheathment, less is known about molecular details of early events for the wrapping of axons by glial processes in the developing nervous system. In this study, we investigate the role of the trans membrane protein Borderless (Bdl) in the developing Drosophila visual system. BdI belongs to the immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily, and its in vivo function is unknown. We show that Bdl is expressed in wrapping glia (WG) in the developing eye disc. Cell-type-specific transgene rescue and knockdown indicate that Bdl is specifically required in WG for the extension of glial processes along photoreceptor axons in the optic lobe, and axon ensheathment. Our results identify Bdl as a novel glia-specific cell surface recognition molecule in regulating glial extension and axon ensheathment. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Cross-species 3D virtual reality toolbox for visual and cognitive experiments	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Virtual reality; Virtual environment; Stimulus presentation; 3D; Cognitive testing	SPATIAL NAVIGATION; WATER-MAZE; ENVIRONMENTS; NEUROSCIENCE; MEMORY; RESPONSES; DYNAMICS; PYTHON; MONKEY; CELLS	Background: Although simplified visual stimuli, such as dots or gratings presented on homogeneous backgrounds, provide strict control over the stimulus parameters during visual experiments, they fail to approximate visual stimulation in natural conditions. Adoption of virtual reality (VR) in neuroscience research has been proposed to circumvent this problem, by combining strict control of experimental variables and behavioral monitoring within complex and realistic environments. New method: We have created a VR toolbox that maximizes experimental flexibility while minimizing implementation costs. A free VR engine (Unreal 3) has been customized to interface with any control software via text commands, allowing seamless introduction into pre-existing laboratory data acquisition frameworks. Furthermore, control functions are provided for the two most common programming languages used in visual neuroscience: Matlab and Python. Results: The toolbox offers milliseconds time resolution necessary for electrophysiological recordings and is flexible enough to support cross-species usage across a wide range of paradigms. Comparison with existing methods: Unlike previously proposed VR solutions whose implementation is complex and time-consuming, our toolbox requires minimal customization or technical expertise to interface with pre-existing data acquisition frameworks as it relies on already familiar programming environments. Moreover, as it is compatible with a variety of display and input devices, identical VR testing paradigms can be used across species, from rodents to humans. Conclusions: This toolbox facilitates the addition of VR capabilities to any laboratory without perturbing pre-existing data acquisition frameworks, or requiring any major hardware changes.

Recently, brainstem neurons were shown to specifically stop locomotion in mammals. However, the cellular properties of these neurons and their activity during locomotion are still unknown. Here, we took advantage of the lamprey model to characterize the activity of a cell population that we now show to be involved in stopping locomotion. We find that these neurons display a burst of spikes that coincides with the end of swimming activity. Their pharmacological activation ends ongoing swimming, whereas the inactivation of these neurons dramatically impairs the rapid termination of swimming. These neurons are henceforth referred to as stop cells, because they play a crucial role in the termination of locomotion. Our findings contribute to the fundamental understanding of motor control and provide important details about the cellular mechanisms involved in locomotor termination.

Conversely, under-dosing of target volumes in an attempt to spare adjacent healthy tissues limits the likelihood of achieving local, long-term control. Thus, the ability to generate personalized data-driven risk profiles for radiotherapy outcomes would provide valuable prognostic information to help guide both clinicians and patients alike. Big data applied to radiation oncology promises to deliver better understanding of outcomes by harvesting and integrating heterogeneous data types, including patient-specific clinical parameters, treatment-related dose volume metrics, and biological risk factors. When taken together, such variables make up the basis for a multi-dimensional space (the "RadoncSpace") in which the presented modeling techniques search in order to identify significant predictors. Herein, we review outcome modeling and big data-mining techniques for both tumor control and radiotherapy induced normal tissue effects. We apply many of the presented modeling approaches onto a cohort of hypofractionated prostate cancer patients taking into account different data types and a large heterogeneous mix of physical and biological parameters. Cross validation techniques are also reviewed for the refinement of the proposed framework architecture and checking individual model performance. We conclude by considering advanced modeling techniques that borrow concepts from big data analytics, such as machine learning and artificial intelligence, before discussing the potential future impact of systems radiobiology approaches.

Mechanisms underlying the social enhancement of vocal learning in songbirds	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						birdsong; catecholamines; attention; social influences; speech	ZEBRA FINCHES; INFANT PREFERENCE; CROSS-LANGUAGE; SPEECH; SONG; BIRDSONG; NEURONS; COMMUNICATION; VOCALIZATIONS; NEUROSCIENCE	Social processes profoundly influence speech and language acquisition. Despite the importance of social influences, little is known about how social interactions modulate vocal learning. Like humans, songbirds learn their vocalizations during development, and they provide an excellent opportunity to reveal mechanisms of social influences on vocal learning. Using yoked experimental designs, we demonstrate that social interactions with adult tutors for as little as 1 d significantly enhanced vocal learning. Social influences on attention to song seemed central to the social enhancement of learning because socially tutored birds were more attentive to the tutor's songs than passively tutored birds, and because variation in attentiveness and in the social modulation of attention significantly predicted variation in vocal learning. Attention to song was influenced by both the nature and amount of tutor song: Pupils paid more attention to songs that tutors directed at them and to tutors that produced fewer songs. Tutors altered their song structure when directing songs at pupils in a manner that resembled how humans alter their vocalizations when speaking to infants, that was distinct from how tutors changed their songs when singing to females, and that could influence attention and learning. Furthermore, social interactions that rapidly enhanced learning increased the activity of noradrenergic and dopaminergic midbrain neurons. These data highlight striking parallels between humans and songbirds in the social modulation of vocal learning and suggest that social influences on attention and midbrain circuitry could represent shared mechanisms underlying the social modulation of vocal learning.

Inhibition of Dopamine Receptor D4 Impedes Autophagic Flux, Proliferation, and Survival of Glioblastoma Stem Cells	CANCER CELL			English	Article							GROWTH-FACTOR RECEPTOR; NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASE; SUBVENTRICULAR ZONE; ADULT NEUROGENESIS; CANCER; BRAIN; PROMOTES; DRUGS; LINES; IDENTIFICATION	Glioblastomas (GBM) grow in a rich neurochemical milieu, but the impact of neurochemicals on GBM growth is largely unexplored. We interrogated 680 neurochemical compounds in patient-derived GBM neural stem cells (GNS) to determine the effects on proliferation and survival. Compounds that modulate dopaminergic, serotonergic, and cholinergic signaling pathways selectively affected GNS growth. In particular, dopamine receptor D4 (DRD4) antagonists selectively inhibited GNS growth and promoted differentiation of normal neural stem cells. DRD4 antagonists inhibited the downstream effectors PDGFR beta, ERK1/2, and mTOR and disrupted the autophagy-lysosomal pathway, leading to accumulation of autophagic vacuoles followed by G(0)/G(1) arrest and apoptosis. These results demonstrate a role for neurochemical pathways in governing GBM stem cell proliferation and suggest therapeutic approaches for GBM.

After completing baseline measures of well-being, all participants (N = 91) completed a public speaking stress task, were implicitly primed with "mindfulness" or "neutral" concepts using a scrambled sentence task, and finally, reported their situational well-being and provided cortisol samples. Simple moderation regression analyses revealed that the implicit mindfulness condition had significant beneficial effects for participants with low trait mindfulness. These participants reported higher situational self-esteem as well as less negative affect, perceived stress, and self reported physiological arousal than their counterparts in the control condition. Cortisol analyses revealed that participants in the implicit mindfulness condition, regardless of level of trait mindfulness, showed a greater decline in cortisol during the early recovery stage compared to those in the control condition. Overall, results suggest that implicitly activating mindfulness can mitigate the psychological and physiological effects of a social stressor.

Subjective Sleep Quality as a Possible Mediator in the Relationship between Personality Traits and Depressive Symptoms in Middle-Aged Adults	PLOS ONE			English	Article							DWELLING OLDER-ADULTS; STRESSFUL LIFE EVENTS; MAJOR DEPRESSION; ANXIETY DISORDERS; PRIMARY INSOMNIA; UNITED-STATES; HIGHER-ORDER; NEUROTICISM; POPULATION; HEALTH	This study explored the mediating role of sleep in the relationship between personality traits and depressive symptoms in a group of community-dwelling men and women (M-age = 57.92, SD = 4.00). Participants completed the short form NEO Five Factor Inventory (NEO-FFI), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D). High neuroticism and low conscientiousness was associated with poor sleep, as well as greater depressive symptom severity. Partial indirect mediation effects were found between personality traits (i.e., neuroticism and conscientiousness) and depressive symptoms through self-report sleep measures. An alternative model was also explored, entering depression as the mediator; however a smaller portion of the variance was explained by this model, compared with the hypothesized model. The current study provides preliminary information regarding the mechanisms that influence the relationship between personality traits, sleep, and depression among a group of community-dwelling middle-aged adults. Implications and future directions are discussed.

For severe cases, surgery with spine instrumentation is required to restore a balanced spine curvature. This surgical procedure may represent a neurological risk for the patient, especially during corrective maneuvers. This study aimed to computationally simulate the surgical instrumentation maneuvers on a patient-specific biomechanical model of the spine and spinal cord to assess and predict potential damage to the spinal cord and spinal nerves. A detailed finite element model (FEM) of the spine and spinal cord of a healthy subject was used as reference geometry. The FEM was personalized to the geometry of the patient using a 3D biplanar radiographic reconstruction technique and 3D dual kriging. Step by step surgical instrumentation maneuvers were simulated in order to assess the neurological risk associated to each maneuver. The surgical simulation methodology implemented was divided into two parts. First, a global multi-body simulation was used to extract the 3D displacement of six vertebral landmarks, which were then introduced as boundary conditions into the personalized FEM in order to reproduce the surgical procedure. The results of the FEM simulation for two cases were compared to published values on spinal cord neurological functional threshold. The efficiency of the reported method was checked considering one patient with neurological complications detected during surgery and one control patient. This comparison study showed that the patient-specific hybrid model reproduced successfully the biomechanics of neurological injury during scoliosis correction maneuvers.

Hospital charts and neuroimaging were utilized to determine the final diagnosis (ischemic stroke, TIA, ICH, or stroke mimic).Results:A total of 960 patients were transported by EMS to ED with suspected stroke. Stroke was diagnosed in 544 patients (56.7%) (38.2% ischemic stroke, 12.2% TIA, 5.3% ICH) and 416 (43.2%) were considered mimics. Age-adjusted mean prehospital systolic BP (SBP) was higher in acute stroke patients (155.6 mm Hg; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 153.4-157.9 mm Hg) compared to mimics (146.1 mm Hg; 95% CI: 142.5-148.6 mm Hg; p < 0.001). Age-adjusted mean prehospital SBP was higher in ICH (172.3 mm Hg; 95% CI: 165.1-179.7 mm Hg) than in either ischemic stroke or TIA (154.7 mm Hg; 95% CI: 152.3-157.0 mm Hg; p < 0.001). Median (interquartile range) SBP drop from initial prehospital SBP to ED SBP was 4 mm Hg (-6 to 17 mm Hg). Mean prehospital SBP was strongly correlated with ED SBP (r = 0.82, p < 0.001).Conclusions:Prehospital SBP is higher in acute stroke relative to stroke mimics and highest in ICH. Given the stability of BP between initial EMS and ED measurements, it may be reasonable to test the feasibility and safety of prehospital antihypertensive therapy in patients with suspected acute stroke.

Functional consequences of GRIN1 mutations were investigated in Xenopus laevis oocytes.Results:We identified heterozygous de novo GRIN1 mutations in 14 individuals and reviewed the phenotypes of all 9 previously reported patients. These 23 individuals presented with a distinct phenotype of profound developmental delay, severe intellectual disability with absent speech, muscular hypotonia, hyperkinetic movement disorder, oculogyric crises, cortical blindness, generalized cerebral atrophy, and epilepsy. Mutations cluster within transmembrane segments and result in loss of channel function of varying severity with a dominant-negative effect. In addition, we describe 2 homozygous GRIN1 mutations (1 missense, 1 truncation), each segregating with severe neurodevelopmental phenotypes in consanguineous families.Conclusions:De novo GRIN1 mutations are associated with severe intellectual disability with cortical visual impairment as well as oculomotor and movement disorders being discriminating phenotypic features. Loss of NMDA receptor function appears to be the underlying disease mechanism. The identification of both heterozygous and homozygous mutations blurs the borders of dominant and recessive inheritance of GRIN1-associated disorders.

Recently, two single-domain camelid antibodies (nanobodies) were shown to bind alpha-synuclein with high affinity. Herein, we investigated how these two nanobodies (NbSyn2 and NbSyn87), which are directed to two distinct epitopes within the C-terminal domain of alpha-synuclein, affect the conformational properties of this protein. Our results suggest that nanobody NbSyn2, which binds to the five C-terminal residues of alpha-synuclein (residues 136-140), does not disrupt the transient long-range interactions that generate a degree of compaction within the native structural ensemble of alpha-synuclein. In contrast, the data that we report indicate that NbSyn87, which targets a central region within the C-terminal domain (residues 118-128), has more substantial effects on the fluctuating secondary and tertiary structure of the protein. These results are consistent with the different effects that the two nanobodies have on the aggregation behavior of a-synuclein in vitro.

This multi-step process relies on overlapping but distinct combinations of molecules that confer synaptic identity. Slitrk molecules are transmembrane proteins that are highly expressed in the central nervous system. We found that two members of the Slitrk family, Slitrk1 and Slitrk2, can regulate synapse formation between hippocampal neurons. Slitrk1 is enriched in postsynaptic fractions and is localized to excitatory synapses. Overexpression of Slitrk1 and Slitrk2 in hippocampal neurons increased the number of synaptic contacts on these neurons. Furthermore, decreased expression of Slitrk1 in hippocampal neurons led to a reduction in the number of excitatory, but not inhibitory, synapses formed in hippocampal neuron cultures. In addition, we demonstrate that different leucine rich repeat domains of the extracellular region of Slitrk1 are necessary to mediate interactions with Slitrk binding partners of the LAR receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase family, and to promote dimerization of Slitrk1. Altogether, our results demonstrate that Slitrk family proteins regulate synapse formation.

Cross-country discrepancies on public understanding of stress concepts: evidence for stress-management psychoeducational programs	BMC PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						Psychological stress; Comprehension; Cross-cultural comparison; Social context	BASAL CORTISOL-LEVELS; REAPPRAISING AROUSAL; HEALTH; PREVENTION; DEPRESSION; RESPONSES; ADOLESCENTS; UNIVERSAL; SCHOOL; BRAIN	Background: Negative effects of stress have pose one of the major threats to the health and economic well being of individuals independently of age and cultural background. Nevertheless, the term "stress" has been globally used unlinked from scientificevidence-based meaning. The discrepancies between scientific and public stress knowledge are focus of concern and little is know about it. This is relevant since misconceptions about stress may influence the effects of stress-management psychoeducational programs and the development of best practices for interventions. The study aimed to analyze stress knowledge among the Canadian and Brazilian general public and to determine the extent to which scientific and popular views of stress differ between those countries. Methods: We evaluated 1156 healthy participants between 18 and 88 years of age recruited from Canada (n = 502) and Brazil (n = 654). To assess stress knowledge, a questionnaire composed of questions regarding stress concepts ("stress is bad" versus "stress-free life is good") and factors capable of triggering the stress response ("novelty, unpredictability, low sense of control and social evaluative threat versus "time pressure, work overload, conflict, unbalance and children") was used. Results: Both Canadian and Brazilian participants showed misconceptions about stress and the factors capable of triggering a stress response. However, the rate of misconceptions was higher in Brazil than in Canada (p < 0.05). Conclusion: These findings suggest a lack of public understanding of stress science and its variance according to a country's society. Psychoeducational programs and vulnerability of stress-related disorder are discussed.

We investigated the neuronal correlates of movement sequencing in 24 healthy controls and 24 schizophrenia patients, with (SZP SQ+) or without (SZP SQ-) sequencing difficulties. We characterized simultaneous and lagged functional connectivity between brain regions involved in movement sequencing using psychophysiological interaction (PPI) and the Granger causality modeling (GCM), respectively. Left premotor cortex (PMC) and superior parietal lobule (SPL) were specifically activated during sequential movements in all participants. Right PMC and precuneus, ipsilateral to the hand executing the task, activated during sequential movements only in healthy controls and SZP SQ-. SZP SQ+ showed hyper-activation in contralateral PMC, as compared to the other groups. PPI analysis revealed a deficit in inhibitory connections within this fronto-parietal network in SZP SQ+ during sequential task. GCM showed a significant lagged effective connectivity from right PMC to left SPL during task and rest periods in all groups and from right PMC to right precuneus in SZP SQ+ group only. Both SZP groups had a significant lagged connectivity from right to left PMC, during sequential task. Our results indicate that aberrant fronto-parietal network connectivity with cortical inhibition deficit and abnormal reliance on previous network activity are related to movement sequencing in SZP. The overactivation of motor cortex seems to be a good compensating strategy, the hyperactivation of parietal cortex is linked to motor deficit symptoms. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

A differential impact of lithium on endothelium-dependent but not on endothelium-independent vessel relaxation	PROGRESS IN NEURO-PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY & BIOLOGICAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						Lithium; Adverse effects of lithium; Bipolar disorder; Stroke; Endothelium; Vascular relaxation; Vascular autoregulation; Cerebrovascular autoregulation; Endothelial function	CEREBRAL-ARTERY INFARCTION; CHRONIC KIDNEY-DISEASE; LIFE MOOD DISORDERS; BIPOLAR DISORDER; INOSITOL TRISPHOSPHATE; DIABETES-MELLITUS; NITRIC-OXIDE; RAT AORTA; CALCIUM; RISK	Lithium is drug for bipolar disorders with a narrow therapeutic window. Lithium was recently reported to prevent stroke and protect vascular endothelium but tends to accumulate particularly in the brain and kidney. Here, adverse effects are common; however mechanisms are still vaguely understood. If lithium could also negatively influence the endothelium is unclear. Wehypothesize that at higher lithium levels, the effects on endothelium reverses - that lithium also impairs endothelial-dependent relaxation of blood vessels. Vessel grafts from de-nerved murine aortas and porcine middle cerebral arteries were preconditioned using media supplemented with lithium chloride or acetate (0.4-100 mmol/L). Native or following phenylephrine-induced vasoconstriction, the relaxation capacity of preconditioned vessels was assessed by isometric myography, using acetylcholine to test the endothelium-dependent or sodium nitroprusside to test the endothelium-independent vasorelaxation, respectively. At the 0.4 mmol/L lithium concentration, acetylcholine-induced endothelium-dependent vessel relaxation was slightly increased, however, diminished in a concentration-dependent manner in vessel grafts preconditioned with lithium at higher therapeutic and supratherapeutic concentrations (0.8-100 mmol/L). In contrast, endothelium-independent vasorelaxation remained unaltered in preconditioned vessel grafts at any lithium concentration tested. Lithium elicits opposing effects on endothelial functions representing a differential impact on the endothelium within the narrow therapeutic window. Lithium accumulation or overdose reduces endothelium-dependent but not endothelium-independent vasorelaxation. The differentially modified endothelium-dependent vascular response represents an additional mechanism contributing to therapeutic or adverse effects of lithium. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Normal Brain Response to Propofol in Advance of Recovery from Unresponsive Wakefulness Syndrome	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						consciousness; unresponsive wakefulness syndrome/vegetative state (UWS/VS); propofol; anesthesia; event-related potentials (ERPs); functional connectivity	COMPLEX SOUND SEQUENCES; MINIMALLY CONSCIOUS STATE; PHASE-LAG INDEX; VEGETATIVE STATE; INDUCED UNCONSCIOUSNESS; NEURAL DETECTION; STATISTICAL REGULARITIES; BEDSIDE DETECTION; CONNECTIVITY; ABSENCE	Up to 40% of individuals with unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (UWS) actually might be conscious. Recent attempts to detect covert consciousness in behaviorally unresponsive patients via neurophysiological patterns are limited by the need to compare data from brain-injured patients to healthy controls. In this report, we pilot an alternative within-subject approach by using propofol to perturb the brain state of a patient diagnosed with UWS. An auditory stimulation series was presented to the patient before, during, and after exposure to propofol while high-density electroencephalograph (BEG) was recorded. Baseline analysis revealed residual markers in the continuous EEG and event related potentials (ERPs) that have been associated with conscious processing. However, these markers were significantly distorted by the patient's pathology, challenging the interpretation of their functional significance. Upon exposure to propofol, changes in EEG characteristics were similar to what is seen in healthy individuals and ERPs associated with conscious processing disappeared. At the 1-month follow up, the patient had regained consciousness. We offer three alternative explanations for these results: (1) the patient was covertly consciousness, and was anesthetized by propofol administration; (2) the patient was unconscious, and the observed EEG changes were a propofol-specific phenomenon; and (3) the patient was unconscious, but his brain networks responded normally in a way that heralded the possibility of recovery. These alternatives will be tested in a larger study, and raise the intriguing possibility of using a general anesthetic as a probe of brain states in behaviorally unresponsive patients.

Implicit learning and generalization of stretch response modulation in humans	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						motor control; stretch reflex; habituation; EMG; inhibitory reaction; threshold position resetting; spasticity; clasp-knife phenomenon	MOTOR CORTEX; CORTICOSPINAL CONTROL; DECEREBRATE CAT; SPINAL-CORD; REFLEX; MUSCLE; INSTRUCTION; ACQUISITION; PERFORMANCE; MECHANISMS	Adaptation of neural responses to repeated muscle stretching likely represents implicit learning to minimize muscle resistance to perturbations. To test this hypothesis, the forearm was placed on a horizontal manipulandum. Elbow flexors or extensors compensated an external load and were stretched by 20 degrees or 70 degrees rotations. Participants were instructed not to intervene by intentionally modifying the muscle resistance elicited by stretching. In addition to phasic stretch reflexes (SRs), muscle stretching was associated with inhibitory periods (IPs) in the ongoing muscle activity starting at minimal latencies of similar to 35 ms. The SR amplitude decreased dramatically across 5-12 trials and was not restored after a resting period of 3-5 min, despite the increase in stretch amplitude from 20 degrees to 70 degrees, but IPs remained present. When SRs were suppressed, stretching of originally nonstretched, antagonist muscles initiated after the rest period showed immediate SR suppression while IPs remained present in the first and subsequent trials. Adaptation to muscle stretching thus includes features characteristic of implicit learning such as memory consolidation and generalization. Adaptation may be achieved by central shifts in the threshold positions at which muscles begin to be activated. Shifts are thought to be prepared in advance and triggered with stretch onset. Threshold position resetting provides a comprehensive explanation of the results in the broader context of the control of posture, movement, and motor learning in the healthy and damaged nervous system.

Both patterns also occur in models of MTLE in vivo and in vitro, and these studies have highlighted the predominant involvement of distinct neuronal network/neurotransmitter receptor signaling in each of them. First, LVF-onset seizures in epileptic rodents can originate from several limbic structures, frequently spread, and are associated with high-frequency oscillations in the ripple band (80-200 Hz), whereas HYP onset seizures initiate in the hippocampus and tend to remain focal with predominant fast ripples (250-500 Hz). Second, in vitro intracellular recordings from principal cells in limbic areas indicate that pharmacologically induced seizure-like discharges with LVF onset are initiated by a synchronous inhibitory event or by a hyperpolarizing inhibitory postsynaptic potential barrage; in contrast, HYP onset is associated with a progressive impairment of inhibition and concomitant unrestrained enhancement of excitation. Finally, in vitro optogenetic experiments show that, under comparable experimental conditions (i.e., 4-aminopyridine application), the initiation of LVF-or HYP-onset seizures depends on the preponderant involvement of interneuronal or principal cell networks, respectively. Overall, these data may provide insight to delineate better therapeutic targets in the treatment of patients presenting with MTLE and, perhaps, with other epileptic disorders as well.

Study of the impact of chronic high-fat feeding on dopamine signalling and behavioural function in rodents has yielded highly variable results. Here we attempt to shed light on this literature by cataloguing findings according to the degree of body weight gain. A pattern emerges whereby high-fat feeding leading to full-scale obesity is largely reported to inhibit dopamine availability and release. In contrast, impairments in dopamine transporter function are apparent in conditions of little to considerable weight gain. Identification of the mechanisms underlying the neurobehavioral adaptations to high-fat diet would benefit from greater investigation of associated metabolic consequences.

Research suggests that frequent NM sufferers also have greater inclinations to fantasy and dream-like daydreams, although it is not known whether they experience intense negative emotion as part of these waking state cognitions. We assessed the daydreams and nap dreams of NM participants to determine whether they have more negative daydream content and more vivid imagery overall. NM and control (CTL) participants completed a daydream procedure followed by a nap targeted to contain 80 min total sleep time and an awakening 10 min into rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. For both daydreams and nap dreams, participants completed a questionnaire regarding 4 factors: negativity, positivity, body sensation, and bizarreness. Results revealed the NM group had elevated positivity, body sensation and bizarreness ratings for daydreams compared with the CTL group, but did not differ from them for negativity ratings. NM participants also had elevated body sensation ratings for nap dreams, but did not differ for negativity, positivity, or bizarreness. Thus, while NMs themselves are characterized by negative affect, NM sufferers nonetheless have higher than normal positivity, body sensation, and bizarreness in their daydreams and specifically more body sensation in their laboratory nap dreams. This may reflect some change in the affective structure of imagery among NM sufferers (e.g., altered experiences of bodily arousal), the differential influence of circadian factors on the 2 groups, or the fact that sleeping in the laboratory tends to suppress NMs.	[Carr, Michelle; Blanchette-Carriere, Cloe; Solomonova, Elizaveta; Paquette, Tyna; Nielsen, Tore] Hop Sacre Coeur Montreal, Dream & Nightmare Lab, 5400 Gouin Blvd West, Montreal, PQ H4J 1C5, Canada; [Carr, Michelle; Solomonova, Elizaveta] Univ Montreal, Dept Biomed Sci, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Blanchette-Carriere, Cloe] Univ Montreal, Dept Psychol, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Nielsen, Tore] Univ Montreal, Dept Psychiat, Montreal, PQ, Canada	Nielsen, T (reprint author), Hop Sacre Coeur Montreal, Dream & Nightmare Lab, 5400 Gouin Blvd West, Montreal, PQ H4J 1C5, Canada.	tore.nielsen@umontreal.ca		Nielsen, Tore/0000-0002-9372-8652; Solomonova, Elizaveta/0000-0002-3733-8676	Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR); Dream Science Foundation/International Association for the Study of Dreams (DSF/IASD)	Research funded by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC), the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR), and the Dream Science Foundation/International Association for the Study of Dreams (DSF/IASD).

The proposed Generative Stochastic Networks (GSNs) framework generalizes Denoising Auto-Encoders (DAEs), and is based on learning the transition operator of a Markov chain whose stationary distribution estimates the data distribution. The transition distribution is a conditional distribution that generally involves a small move, so it has fewer dominant modes and is unimodal in the limit of small moves. This simplifies the learning problem, making it less like density estimation and more akin to supervised function approximation, with gradients that can be obtained by backprop. The theorems provided here provide a probabilistic interpretation for DAEs and generalize them; seen in the context of this framework, auto-encoders that learn with injected noise are a special case of GSNs and can be interpreted as generative models. The theorems also provide an interesting justification for dependency networks and generalized pseudolikelihood, and define an appropriate joint distribution and sampling mechanism, even when the conditionals are not consistent. GSNs can be used with missing inputs and can be used to sample subsets of variables given the others. Experiments validating these theoretical results are conducted on both synthetic datasets and image datasets. The experiments employ a particular architecture that mimics the Deep Boltzmann Machine Gibbs sampler, but that allows training to proceed with backprop through a recurrent neural network with noise injected inside and without the need for layerwise pretraining.

This article focuses on how the culture of psychiatry affects our understanding of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). PTSD is diagnosed by means of standardized symptom criteria and scales. Yet it is a heterogeneous phenomenon. The illusion of homogeneity is fostered by a categorical conception of traumatic memory that homogenizes posttraumatic memories and erects an obstacle to investigating the disorder's historical nature, clinical phenomenology, and neuro-physiology and neuro-anatomy. I illustrate this process, via an epidemic of PTSD that now affects a quarter of a million American war veterans.

The processing of different depth cues involves both dorsal and ventral visual pathways. We investigated whether facial surfaces defined by individual depth cues resulted in meaningful face representations-representations that maintain the relationship between the population of faces as defined in a multidimensional face space. We measured face identity aftereffects for facial surfaces defined by individual depth cues (Experiments 1 and 2) and tested whether the aftereffect transfers across depth cues (Experiments 3 and 4). Facial surfaces and their morphs to the average face were defined purely by one of shading, texture, motion, or binocular disparity. We obtained identification thresholds for matched (matched identity between adapting and test stimuli), non-matched (non-matched identity between adapting and test stimuli), and no-adaptation (showing only the test stimuli) conditions for each cue and across different depth cues. We found robust face identity aftereffect in both experiments. Our results suggest that depth cues do contribute to forming meaningful face representations that are depth cue invariant. Depth cue invariance would require integration of information across different areas and different pathways for object recognition, and this in turn has important implications for cortical models of visual object recognition.

Biexponential Longitudinal Relaxation in White Matter: Characterization and Impact on T-1 Mapping with IR-FSE and MP2RAGE	MAGNETIC RESONANCE IN MEDICINE			English	Article						quantitative MRI; T-1 mapping; inversion recovery; MP2RAGE; white matter	MAGNETIZATION-TRANSFER CONTRAST; HUMAN-BRAIN; INVERSION-RECOVERY; IN-VIVO; MULTIPLE-SCLEROSIS; PROTON T-1; TIME; TISSUE; OPTIMIZATION; WATER	Purpose: Magnetization transfer in white matter (WM) causes biexponential relaxation, but most quantitative T-1 measurements fit data assuming monoexponential relaxation. The resulting monoexponential T-1 estimate varies based on scan parameters and represents a source of variation between studies, especially at high fields. In this study, we characterized WM T-1 relaxation and performed simulations to determine how to minimize this deviation. Methods: To characterize biexponential relaxation, four volunteers were scanned at 3T and 7T using inversion recovery fast spin echo (IR-FSE) with 13 inversion times (TIs). Three volunteers were scanned with IR-FSE using TIs chosen by simulations to reduce T-1 deviation, and with MP2RAGE. Results: At 3T, the biexponential relaxation has a short component of T-1 = 48 ms (9%) and a long component of T-1 = 939 ms. At 7T the short component is T-1 = 57 ms (11%) and the long component is 1349 ms (89%). For IR-FSE, acquiring four TIs with a minimum of 150 ms (3T) or 200 ms (7T) yielded monoexponential T-1 estimates that match the long component to within 10 ms. For MP2RAGE, significant differences (90 ms at 3T, 125 ms at 7T) remain at all parameter values. Conclusion: Many T-1 mapping sequences yield robust estimates of the long T-1 component with suitable choice of TIs, allowing reproducible, sequence-independent T-1 values to be measured. However, this is not true of MP2RAGE in its current implementation. (C) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The transmitter (TX) and receiver (RX) share a single antenna to reduce implant size and complexity. The TX uses impulse radio ultra-wide band (IR-UWB) based on an edge combining approach, and the RX uses a novel 2.4-GHz on-off keying (OOK) receiver. Proper isolation (>20 dB) between the TX and RX path is implemented 1) by shaping the transmitted pulses to fall within the unregulated UWB spectrum (3.1-7 GHz), and 2) by space-efficient filtering (avoiding a circulator or diplexer) of the downlink OOK spectrum in the RX low-noise amplifier. The UWB 3.1-7 GHz transmitter can use either OOK or binary phase shift keying (BPSK) modulation schemes. The proposed FDT provides dual band 500-Mbps TX uplink data rate and 100 Mbps RX downlink data rate, and it is fully integrated into standard TSMC 0.18-mu m CMOS within a total size of 0.8 mm(2). The total measured power consumption is 10.4 mW in full duplex mode (5 mW at 100 Mbps for RX, and 5.4 mW at 500 Mbps or 10.8 pJ/bit for TX). Additionally, a 3-coil inductive link along with on-chip power management circuits allows to powering up the implantable transceiver wirelessly by delivering 25 mW extracted from a 13.56-MHz carrier signal, at a total efficiency of 41.6%.

This paper presents a dedicated integrated potentiostat transducer circuit and its selective electrode interface. A custom 2-electrode time-based potentiostat circuit was fabricated with 0.13 mu m CMOS technology and provides a wide dynamic input current range of 20 pA to 600 nA with 56 mu W, for a minimum sampling frequency of 1.25 kHz. A multi-working electrode chip is functionalized with carbon nanotubes (CNT)-based chemical coatings that offer high sensitivity and selectivity towards electroactive dopamine and non-electroactive glutamate. The prototype was experimentally tested with different concentrations levels of both neurotransmitter types, and results were similar to measurements with a commercially available potentiostat. This paper validates the functionality of the proposed biosensor, and demonstrates its potential for the selective detection of a large number of neurochemicals.

Neural mechanisms linking social status and inflammatory responses to social stress	SOCIAL COGNITIVE AND AFFECTIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						subjective social status; stress; dorsomedial prefrontal cortex; inflammation; interleukin-6; fMRI	MEDIAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; SOCIOECONOMIC-STATUS; SEX-DIFFERENCES; BRAIN; THREAT; HUMANS; HEALTH; INTERLEUKIN-6; NEUROSCIENCE; HIERARCHY	Social stratification has important implications for health and well-being, with individuals lower in standing in a hierarchy experiencing worse outcomes than those higher up the social ladder. Separate lines of past research suggest that alterations in inflammatory processes and neural responses to threat may link lower social status with poorer outcomes. This study was designed to bridge these literatures to investigate the neurocognitive mechanisms linking subjective social status and inflammation. Thirty-one participants reported their subjective social status, and underwent a functional magnetic resonance imaging scan while they were socially evaluated. Participants also provided blood samples before and after the stressor, which were analysed for changes in inflammation. Results showed that lower subjective social status was associated with greater increases in inflammation. Neuroimaging data revealed lower subjective social status was associated with greater neural activity in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex ( DMPFC) in response to negative feedback. Finally, results indicated that activation in the DMPFC in response to negative feedback mediated the relation between social status and increases in inflammatory activity. This study provides the first evidence of a neurocognitive pathway linking subjective social status and inflammation, thus furthering our understanding of how social hierarchies shape neural and physiological responses to social interactions.

Methods: We automatically detected HFOs in intracerebral electroencephalography (EEG) recordings of 45 patients. We characterized the interaction between the HFOs and the amplitude and phase of automatically detected slow waves during sleep. We computed features associated with HFOs, and compared classic features such as rate, amplitude, duration, and frequency to novel features related to the interaction between HFOs and slow waves. To quantify the practical significance of the difference in these features we classified the channels as recording from normal/epileptic regions using logistic regression. We assessed the results in different brain regions to study differences in the HFO characteristics at the lobar level. Results: We found a clear difference in the coupling between the phase of slow waves during sleep and the occurrence of HFOs. In channels recording physiologic activity, the HFOs tend to occur after the peak of the deactivated state of the slow wave, and in channels with epileptic activity, the HFOs occur more often before this peak. This holds for HFOs in the ripple (80-250 Hz) and fast ripple (250-500 Hz) bands, and different regions of the brain. When using this interaction to automatically classify channels as recording from normal/epileptic brain regions, the performance is better than when using other HFO characteristics. We confirmed differences in the HFO characteristics in mesiotemporal structures and in the occipital lobe. Significance: We found the association between slow waves and HFOs to be different in normal and epileptic brain regions, emphasizing their different origin. This is also of practical significance, since it improves the separation between channels recording from normal and epileptic brain regions.

J	Frauscher, B; von Ellenrieder, N; Dubeau, F; Gotman, J				Frauscher, Birgit; von Ellenrieder, Nicolas; Dubeau, Francois; Gotman, Jean			EEG desynchronization during phasic REM sleep suppresses interictal epileptic activity in humans	EPILEPSIA			English	Article						Epilepsy; Intracerebral EEG; Polysomnography; High-frequency oscillations; Sleep	HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; TEMPORAL-LOBE EPILEPSY; DEPENDENT PLASTICITY; DEPTH; DISCHARGES; CATS; WAKEFULNESS; ELECTRODES; MECHANISM; BIOMARKER	Objective: Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep has a suppressing effect on epileptic activity. This effect might be directly related to neuronal desynchronization mediated by cholinergic neurotransmission. We investigated whether interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) and high frequency oscillations-a biomarker of the epileptogenic zone -are evenly distributed across phasic and tonic REM sleep. We hypothesized that IEDs aremore suppressed during phasic REM sleep because of additional cholinergic drive. Methods: Twelve patients underwent polysomnography during long-term combined scalp-intracerebral electroencephalography (EEG) recording. After sleep staging in the scalp EEG, we identified segments of REM sleep with rapid eye movements (phasic REM) and segments of REM sleep without rapid eye movements (tonic REM). In the intracerebral EEG, we computed the power in frequencies <30 Hz and from 30 to 500 Hz, and marked IEDs, ripples (>80 Hz) and fast ripples (>250 Hz). We grouped the intracerebral channels into channels in the seizure-onset zone (SOZ), the exclusively irritative zone (EIZ), and the normal zone (NoZ). Results: Power in frequencies <30 Hz was lower during phasic than tonic REM sleep (p < 0.001), most likely reflecting increased desynchronization. IEDs, ripples and fast ripples, were less frequent during phasic than tonic REM sleep (phasic REM sleep: 39% of spikes, 35% of ripples, 18% of fast ripples, tonic REM sleep: 61% of spikes, 65% of ripples, 82% of fast ripples; p < 0.001). In contrast to ripples in the epileptogenic zone, physiologic ripples were more abundant during phasic REM sleep (phasic REM sleep: 73% in NoZ, 30% in EIZ, 28% in SOZ, tonic REM sleep: 27% in NoZ, 70% in EIZ, 72% in SOZ; p < 0.001). Significance: Phasic REM sleep has an enhanced suppressive effect on IEDs, corroborating the role of EEG desynchronization in the suppression of interictal epileptic activity. In contrast, physiologic ripples were increased during phasic REM sleep, possibly reflecting REM-related memory consolidation and dreaming.

Although heparins and vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) has been used extensively for many decades, their narrow therapeutic range, interactions with other medications and food, and the need for routine monitoring of blood levels have led to the search for less problematic alternatives. Direct oral anticoagulants represent an important advance in anticoagulation therapy, directly inhibiting thrombin (dabigatran) or factor Xa (rivaroxaban, apixaban) they represent an effective and safe alternatives to VKAs and heparins in the prevention and treatment of several thromboembolic disorders. DOCAs are associated with a low overall intracranial hemorrhage risk; however, lifethreatening bleeding can occur. Reversal agents are approved for some and under development for others, concerns over the lack of antidotes or difficulty in obtaining them has tempered enthusiasm for their use because of the perception of better safety with heparins and VKAs as a result of the availability of effective reversal strategies. Appropriate use of these agents requires knowledge of their individual characteristics, mechanisms of action, pharmacokinetics, ways of monitoring, and when needed, manage patients in need of urgent surgery especially in life-threatening bleeds. This article provides a suggested comprehensive approach to manage patients with intracranial hemorrhage while on direct oral anticoagulants who require an urgent surgical intervention and who cannot wait for plasma concentration to decline.

Over the past 20 years, much effort has been focused on unraveling the genetic bases of CHD. In particular, studies in human genetics coupled with those of model organisms have provided valuable insights into the gene regulatory networks underlying CHD pathogenesis. Hox genes encode transcription factors that are required for the patterning of the anterior-posterior axis in the embryo. In this review, we focus on the emerging role of anteriorly expressed Hox genes (Hoxa1, Hoxb1, and Hoxa3) in cardiac development, specifically their contribution to patterning of cardiac progenitor cells and formation of the great arteries. Recent evidence regarding the cooperative regulation of heart development by Hox proteins with members of the TALE-class of homeodomain proteins such as Pbx and Meis transcription factors is also discussed. These findings are highly relevant to human pathologies as they pinpoint new genes that increase susceptibility to cardiac anomalies and provide novel mechanistic insights into CHD.

However, anatomical criteria overlook etiology, potentially hampering treatment decisions. This study identified clusters of individuals using a comprehensive array of biopsychosocial measures. Data were collected from a case-control study of 1031 chronic TMD cases and 3247 TMD-free controls. Three subgroups were identified using supervised cluster analysis (referred to as the adaptive, pain-sensitive, and global symptoms clusters). Compared with the adaptive cluster, participants in the pain-sensitive cluster showed heightened sensitivity to experimental pain, and participants in the global symptoms cluster showed both greater pain sensitivity and greater psychological distress. Cluster membership was strongly associated with chronic TMD: 91.5% of TMD cases belonged to the pain-sensitive and global symptoms clusters, whereas 41.2% of controls belonged to the adaptive cluster. Temporomandibular disorder cases in the pain-sensitive and global symptoms clusters also showed greater pain intensity, jaw functional limitation, and more comorbid pain conditions. Similar results were obtained when the same methodology was applied to a smaller case-control study consisting of 199 chronic TMD cases and 201 TMD-free controls. During a median 3-year follow-up period of TMD-free individuals, participants in the global symptoms cluster had greater risk of developing first-onset TMD (hazard ratio=2.8) compared with participants in the other 2 clusters. Cross-cohort predictive modeling was used to demonstrate the reliability of the clusters.

Yet, there are few meta-analyses providing assessments of the minimum cerebral denominators of pain. Here, we used a statistical meta-analysis method, called activation likelihood estimation, to define (1) core brain regions activated by pain per se, irrelevant of pain modality, paradigm, or participants and (2) activation likelihood estimation commonalities and differences between patients with chronic pain and healthy individuals. A subtraction analysis of 138 independent data sets revealed that the minimum denominator for activation across pain modalities and paradigms included the right insula, secondary sensory cortex, and right anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Common activations for healthy subjects and patients with pain alike included the thalamus, ACC, insula, and cerebellum. A comparative analysis revealed that healthy individuals were more likely to activate the cingulum, thalamus, and insula. Our results point toward the central role of the insular cortex and ACC in pain processing, irrelevant of modality, body part, or clinical experience; thus, furthering the importance of ACC and insular activation as key regions for the human experience of pain.

However, descending corticospinal tract diffusion-weighted MRI signal has not been documented in the setting of cerebral sinovenous thrombosis, and its role is not understood. OBJECTIVE: We describe a neonate with cerebral sinovenous thrombosis, extensive diffusion restriction, and bilateral descending corticospinal tract,diffusion-weighted MRI signal on MRI of the brain. We discuss the underlying mechanisms and implications of these findings in venous ischemia. CONCLUSION: The prognostic value of descending corticospinal tract diffusion-weighted MRI signal differs when observed in cerebral sinovenous thrombosis from when observed in arterial ischemic stroke. Consequently, caution should be exercised in using descending corticospinal tract diffusion-weighted MRI signal to predict outcome in children with cerebral sinovenous thrombosis.

Materials and Methods: In this study, participants took part in a home-based training program. They were randomized to one of the two training groups. One group played an off-the-shelf videogame (i.e., Crazy Taxi), and the other group played a brain training game (i.e., Insight). Training consisted of 60 training sessions of 1 hour each, which were completed in 3 months (5 hours a week). After each training session, participants completed a Flow questionnaire to measure their engagement with the training. Results: The analysis was performed with a linear growth curve model. The results indicate that on average, there was no change in flow for the Insight group between time points. There was no difference between the initial flow status of the Insight group and the Crazy Taxi group. However, the interaction between group membership and time was statistically significant, indicating that the participants in the Crazy Taxi group increased their scores at each week at a rate that was 0.99 larger than those in the Insight group. Conclusion: The analyses revealed that both groups experienced increase in Flow over the period, but only participants in the Crazy Taxi group significantly improved in Flow. This has long-term implications since we would expect participation to go beyond 12 weeks in a real-world scenario.

Alzheimer's Dis Neuroimaging	Early role of vascular dysregulation on late-onset Alzheimer's disease based on multifactorial data-driven analysis	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							ACID-BINDING PROTEIN; BLOOD-BRAIN-BARRIER; CEREBROSPINAL-FLUID; NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASES; MATRIX METALLOPROTEINASES; HYPOTHETICAL MODEL; DYNAMIC BIOMARKERS; DEMENTIA; PROGRESSION; INSULIN	Multifactorial mechanisms underlying late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) are poorly characterized from an integrative perspective. Here spatiotemporal alterations in brain amyloid-beta deposition, metabolism, vascular, functional activity at rest, structural properties, cognitive integrity and peripheral proteins levels are characterized in relation to LOAD progression. We analyse over 7,700 brain images and tens of plasma and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Through a multifactorial data-driven analysis, we obtain dynamic LOAD-abnormality indices for all biomarkers, and a tentative temporal ordering of disease progression. Imaging results suggest that intra-brain vascular dysregulation is an early pathological event during disease development. Cognitive decline is noticeable from initial LOAD stages, suggesting early memory deficit associated with the primary disease factors. High abnormality levels are also observed for specific proteins associated with the vascular system's integrity. Although still subjected to the sensitivity of the algorithms and biomarkers employed, our results might contribute to the development of preventive therapeutic interventions.

Based on novel methods, including inhomogeneous magnetization transfer (ihMT) and dedicated SC probabilistic atlas post-processing, the present study focuses on the in vivo characterization of the healthy SC tissue in terms of regional microstructure differences between (i) upper and lower cervical vertebral levels and (ii) sensory and motor tracts, as well as differences attributed to normal aging. Forty-eight healthy volunteers aged from 20 to 70 years old were included in the study and scanned at 3 T using axial high-resolution T-2*-w imaging, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and ihMT, at two vertebral levels (C2 and C5). A processing pipeline with minimal user intervention, SC segmentation and spatial normalization into a reference space was implemented in order to assess quantitative morphological and structural parameters (cross-sectional areas, scalar DTI and MT/ihMT metrics) in specific white and gray matter regions of interest. The multi-parametric MRI metrics collected allowed upper and lower cervical levels to be distinguished, with higher ihMT ratio (ihMTR), higher axial diffusivity (lambda(parallel to)) and lower radial diffusivity (lambda(perpendicular to)) at C2 compared with C5. Significant differences were also observed between white matter fascicles, with higher ihMTR and lower lambda(parallel to) in motor tracts compared with posterior sensory tracts. Finally, aging was found to be associated with significant metric alterations (decreased ihMTR and lambda(parallel to)). The methodology proposed here, which can be easily transferred to the clinic, provides new insights for SC characterization. It bears great potential to study focal and diffuse SC damage in neurodegenerative and demyelinating diseases. Copyright (C) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

The hypothesis is that the musical deficits arise from altered pitch processing, with impairments in pitch discrimination (i.e., pitch change detection, pitch direction discrimination and identification) and short-term memory. The present review article focuses on the deficit of short-term memory for pitch. Overall, the data discussed here suggest impairments at each level of processing in short-term memory tasks; starting with the encoding of the pitch information and the creation of the adequate memory trace, the retention of the pitch traces over time as well as the recollection and comparison of the stored information with newly incoming information. These impairments have been related to altered brain responses in a distributed fronto-temporal network, associated with decreased connectivity between these structures, as well as in abnormalities in the connectivity between the two auditory cortices. In contrast, amusic participants' short-term memory abilities for verbal material are preserved. These findings show that short-term memory deficits in congenital amusia are specific to pitch, suggesting a pitch-memory system that is, at least partly, separated from verbal memory.

Methods We compared overall health and baseline attributes of organ donors between 2000-2005 and 2006-2012 using our prospective transplant database. Descriptive and comparative analyses of the 2 historical cohorts were performed. Results A total of 1040 brain-dead organ donors were included in our analysis: 496 from the 2000-2005 period and 544 from the 2006-2012 period. Our analysis revealed that donors from the recent (2006-2012) period were more likely to have increased body mass index (26.4 6.0 v. 25.0 4.8, p = 0.003), smoking history (57.0% v. 27.2%, p < 0.001), coronary artery disease (14.3% v. 3.2%, p = 0.015) and dyslipidemia (19.1% v. 4.2%, p < 0.001), but less likely to have concurrent infection (1.1% v. 7.9%, p < 0.001) than those from the earlier period. Conclusion Our data suggest that the characteristics and comorbidities of brain-dead organ donors have somewhat deteriorated over the last decade. Further studies are needed to evaluate the impact of these health attributes on donated organ utilization and outcomes.

Little is known about Canadian youth football injuries. The objectives of this study were (a) to contrast the injuries in Canadian and American football players aged 6 to 17 years and (b) compare the injuries sustained during organized football with those in nonorganized football. Methods. Using a retrospective cohort design based on data from the Canadian Hospitals Injury Reporting and Prevention Program and the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System a comparison of injuries was made. Results. Trends in injuries were comparable. Proportions and odds of injuries were similar, except for a few exceptions. In Canada, more girls were injured and fractures were more prevalent. Compared with nonorganized football, organized football players were older, involved more males, and suffered more traumatic brain injuries and injuries to their lower extremities. Conclusion. Canadian and American youth football injuries were similar. The type of football, be it organized or nonorganized, has an impact on injuries.

The videos depict acted-out emotions under realistic conditions with a large degree of variation in attributes such as pose and illumination, making it worthwhile to explore approaches which consider combinations of features from multiple modalities for label assignment. In this paper we present our approach to learning several specialist models using deep learning techniques, each focusing on one modality. Among these are a convolutional neural network, focusing on capturing visual information in detected faces, a deep belief net focusing on the representation of the audio stream, a K-Means based "bag-of-mouths" model, which extracts visual features around the mouth region and a relational autoencoder, which addresses spatio-temporal aspects of videos. We explore multiple methods for the combination of cues from these modalities into one common classifier. This achieves a considerably greater accuracy than predictions from our strongest single-modality classifier. Our method was the winning submission in the 2013 Emoti W challenge and achieved a test set accuracy of 47.67 % on the 2014 dataset.

Despite numerous in vitro studies, how they act in native cellular contexts is poorly understood. A Drosophila CD36 homologue, sensory neuron membrane protein 1 (SNMP1), was previously shown to facilitate detection of lipid-derived pheromones by their cognate receptors in olfactory cilia. Here we investigate how SNMP1 functions in vivo. Structure-activity dissection demonstrates that SNMP1's ectodomain is essential, but intracellular and transmembrane domains dispensable, for cilia localization and pheromone-evoked responses. SNMP1 can be substituted by mammalian CD36, whose ectodomain can interact with insect pheromones. Homology modelling, using the mammalian LIMP-2 structure as template, reveals a putative tunnel in the SNMP1 ectodomain that is sufficiently large to accommodate pheromone molecules. Amino-acid substitutions predicted to block this tunnel diminish pheromone sensitivity. We propose a model in which SNMP1 funnels hydrophobic pheromones from the extracellular fluid to integral membrane receptors.

Suppression of mTORC1 activity leads to rapid dephosphorylation of eIF4E-binding proteins (4E-BP1-3) and subsequent inhibition of mRNA translation. However, how the different 4E-BPs affect translation during prolonged use of mTOR inhibitors is not known. Here we show that the expression of 4E-BP3, but not that of 4E-BP1 or 4E-BP2, is transcriptionally induced during prolonged mTORC1 inhibition in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, our data reveal that 4E-BP3 expression is controlled by the transcription factor TFE3 through a cis-regulatory element in the EIF4EBP3 gene promoter. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated EIF4EBP3 gene disruption in human cancer cells mitigated the inhibition of translation and proliferation caused by prolonged treatment with mTOR inhibitors. Our findings show that 4E-BP3 is an important effector of mTORC1 and a robust predictive biomarker of therapeutic response to prolonged treatment with mTOR-targeting drugs in cancer.

Yet it is inconclusive whether these associations are causal. Methods and Findings We performed Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses using two genetic risk scores (GRSs) as instrumental variables (IVs). The first GRS consisted of four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the CRP gene (GRS(CRP)), and the second consisted of 18 SNPs that were significantly associated with CRP levels in the largest genome-wide association study (GWAS) to date (GRS(GWAS)). To optimize power, we used summary statistics from GWAS consortia and tested the association of these two GRSs with 32 complex somatic and psychiatric outcomes, with up to 123,865 participants per outcome from populations of European ancestry. We performed heterogeneity tests to disentangle the pleiotropic effect of IVs. A Bonferroni-corrected significance level of less than 0.0016 was considered statistically significant. An observed p-value equal to or less than 0.05 was considered nominally significant evidence for a potential causal association, yet to be confirmed. The strengths (F-statistics) of the IVs were 31.92-3,761.29 and 82.32-9,403.21 for GRS(CRP) and GRS(GWAS), respectively. CRP GRS(GWAS) showed a statistically significant protective relationship of a 10% genetically elevated CRP level with the risk of schizophrenia (odds ratio [OR] 0.86 [95% CI 0.79-0.94]; p < 0.001). We validated this finding with individual-level genotype data from the schizophrenia GWAS (OR 0.96 [95% CI 0.94-0.98]; p < 1.72 x 10(-6)). Further, we found that a standardized CRP polygenic risk score (CRPPRS) at p-value thresholds of 1 x 10(-4), 0.001, 0.01, 0.05, and 0.1 using individual-level data also showed a protective effect (OR < 1.00) against schizophrenia; the first CRPPRS (built of SNPs with p < 1 x 10(-4)) showed a statistically significant (p < 2.45 x 10(-4)) protective effect with an OR of 0.97 (95% CI 0.95-0.99). The CRP GRS(GWAS) showed that a 10% increase in genetically determined CRP level was significantly associated with coronary artery disease (OR 0.88 [95% CI 0.84-0.94]; p < 2.4 x 10(-5)) and was nominally associated with the risk of inflammatory bowel disease (OR 0.85 [95% CI 0.74-0.98]; p < 0.03), Crohn disease (OR 0.81 [95% CI 0.70-0.94]; p < 0.005), psoriatic arthritis (OR 1.36 [95% CI 1.00-1.84]; p < 0.049), knee osteoarthritis (OR 1.17 [95% CI 1.01-1.36]; p < 0.04), and bipolar disorder (OR 1.21 [95% CI 1.05-1.40]; p < 0.007) and with an increase of 0.72 (95% CI 0.11-1.34; p < 0.02) mm Hg in systolic blood pressure, 0.45 (95% CI 0.06-0.84; p < 0.02) mm Hg in diastolic blood pressure, 0.01 ml/min/1.73 m(2) (95% CI 0.003-0.02; p < 0.005) in estimated glomerular filtration rate from serum creatinine, 0.01 g/dl (95% CI 0.0004-0.02; p < 0.04) in serum albumin level, and 0.03 g/dl (95% CI 0.008-0.05; p < 0.009) in serum protein level. However, after adjustment for heterogeneity, neither GRS showed a significant effect of CRP level (at p < 0.0016) on any of these outcomes, including coronary artery disease, nor on the other 20 complex outcomes studied. Our study has two potential limitations: the limited variance explained by our genetic instruments modeling CRP levels in blood and the unobserved bias introduced by the use of summary statistics in our MR analyses. Conclusions Genetically elevated CRP levels showed a significant potentially protective causal relationship with risk of schizophrenia. We observed nominal evidence at an observed p < 0.05 using either GRS(CRP) or GRS(GWAS)-with persistence after correction for heterogeneity-for a causal relationship of elevated CRP levels with psoriatic osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, knee osteoarthritis, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, serum albumin, and bipolar disorder. These associations remain yet to be confirmed. We cannot verify any causal effect of CRP level on any of the other common somatic and neuropsychiatric outcomes investigated in the present study. This implies that interventions that lower CRP level are unlikely to result in decreased risk for the majority of common complex outcomes.	[Prins, Bram.

However, due to their highly dynamic nature, it remains a challenge to characterize the fundamental aspects of lipid rafts that are important for specific neuronal processes. An experimental approach is presented here that allows for the interfacing of living neurons with an experimentally accessible model membrane where lipid order in cellular rafts can be reproducibly mimicked. It is demonstrated that coexisting lipid microdomains in model membranes can regulate axonal guidance and establish stable presynaptic contacts when interfaced with neurons in vitro. Experimental evidence is provided where specific functional groups and lateral organizations are favored by neurons in establishing synaptic connections. The model membrane platform presented in this work provides an accessible and direct means to investigate how lipid rafts regulate synapse formation. This experimental platform can similarly be extended to explore a variety of other cellular events where lipid lateral organization is believed to be important.

Due to rapidly evolving evidence related to diagnosis and clinical management, updated guidance on the diagnosis and treatment of gastrointestinal neuroendocrine tumors (GI-NETs) are of clinical importance. Well-differentiated GI-NETs may exhibit indolent clinical behavior and are often metastatic at diagnosis. Some NET patients will develop secretory disease requiring symptom control to optimize quality of life and clinical outcomes. Optimal management of GI-NETs is in a multi-disciplinary environment and is multimodal, requiring collaboration between medical, surgical, imaging and pathology specialties. Clinical application of advances in pathological classification and diagnostic technologies, along with evolving surgical, radiotherapeutic and medical therapies are critical to the advancement of patient care. We performed a systematic literature search to update our last set of published guidelines (2010) and identified new level 1 evidence for novel therapies, including telotristat etiprate (TELESTAR), lanreotide (CLARINET), everolimus (RADIANT-2; RADIANT-4) and peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT; NETTER-1). Integrating these data with the clinical knowledge of 16 multi-disciplinary experts, we devised consensus recommendations to guide state of the art clinical management of GI-NETs.

In the current study, event-related fMRI was used to investigate the neural correlates of context memory decline in healthy middle aged adults (MA) compared with young adults (YA). Participants were scanned while performing easy and hard versions of spatial and temporal context memory tasks. Scans were obtained at encoding and retrieval. Significant reductions in context memory retrieval accuracy were observed in MA, compared with YA. The fMRI results revealed that overall, both groups exhibited similar patterns of brain activity in parahippocampal cortex, ventral occipito-temporal regions and prefrontal cortex (PFC) during encoding. In contrast, at retrieval, there were group differences in ventral occipito-temporal and PFC activity, due to these regions being more activated in MA, compared with YA. Furthermore, only in YA, increased encoding activity in ventrolateral PFC, and increased retrieval activity in occipital cortex, predicted increased retrieval accuracy. In MA, increased retrieval activity in anterior PFC predicted increased retrieval accuracy. These results suggest that there are changes in PFC contributions to context memory at midlife.

The present magnetic resonance imaging study aims to compare the organization of gray matter structural covariance networks between 109 cognitively unimpaired controls (CTRL) and 109 AD patients positive to beta-amyloid at the early stages of the disease, using voxel-based morphometry. The default-mode network (DMN; medial temporal lobe subsystem) was less extended in AD patients in comparison with CTRL, with a significant decrease in the structural association between the entorhinal cortex and the medial prefrontal and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortices. The DMN (midline core subsystem) was also less extended in AD patients. Trends toward increased structural association were observed in the salience and executive control networks. The observed changes suggest that early disruptions in structural association between heteromodal association cortices and the entorhinal cortex could contribute to an isolation of the hippocampal formation, potentially giving rise to the clinical hallmark of AD, progressive memory impairment. It also provides critical support to the hypothesis that the reduced connectivity within the DMN in early AD is accompanied by an enhancement of connectivity in the salience and executive control networks.

Retrospective analysis of the effect of CAPOX and mFOLFOX6 dose intensity on survival in colorectal patients in the adjuvant setting	CURRENT ONCOLOGY			English	Article						CAPOX; mFOLFOX6; dose intensity; disease-free survival; colorectal cancer	III COLON-CANCER; BOLUS FLUOROURACIL; PHASE-II; STAGE-II; CAPECITABINE; OXALIPLATIN; TRIAL; CHEMOTHERAPY; LEUCOVORIN; 1ST-LINE	Background Despite lack of a true comparative study, the FOLFOX (5-fluorouracil-leucovorin-oxaliplatin) and CAPOX (capecitabine-oxaliplatin) regimens are believed to be similar in their efficacy and tolerability in the treatment of stage III colorectal cancer. However, that belief has been disputed, because real-life data suggest that the CAPOX regimen is more toxic, leading to more frequent reductions in the delivered dose intensity-thus raising questions about the effect of dose intensity on clinical outcomes. Methods A retrospective data review for two Canadian institutions, the Segal Cancer Centre and the Tom Baker Cancer Centre, considered patients diagnosed with stage III colorectal cancer during 2006-2013. Primary endpoints were dose intensity and toxicity, with a secondary endpoint of disease-free survival. Results The study enrolled 180 eligible patients (80 at the Segal Cancer Centre, 100 at the Tom Baker Cancer Centre). Of those 180 patients, 75 received CAPOX, and 105 received mFOLFOX6. In the CAPOX group, a significant dose reduction was identified for capecitabine compared with 5-fluorouracil in mFOLFOX6 group (p = 0.0014). Similarly, a significant dose reduction was observed for oxaliplatin in mFOLFOX6 compared with oxaliplatin in CAPOX (p = 0.0001). Compared with the patients receiving CAPOX, those receiving mFOLFOX6 were twice as likely to experience a treatment delay of more than 1 cycle-length (p = 0.03855). Toxicity was more frequent in patients receiving mFOLFOX6 (nausea: 30% vs. 18%; diarrhea: 47% vs. 24%; peripheral sensory neuropathy: 32% vs. 3%). At a median follow-up of 40 months, preliminary data showed no difference in disease-free survival (p = 0.598). Pooled data from both institutions were also separately analyzed, and no significant differences were found. Conclusions Our results support the use of CAPOX despite a lack of head-to-head randomized trial data.	[Mamo, A.; Baig, A.; Rho, Y.

Canadian consensus: inhibition of ALK-positive tumours in advanced non-small-cell lung cancer	CURRENT ONCOLOGY			English	Article						ALK; anaplastic lymphoma kinase; non-small-cell lung cancer; molecular testing; targeted inhibition	ANAPLASTIC LYMPHOMA KINASE; EML4-ALK FUSION GENE; ONCOGENIC MUTATIONS; MOLECULAR PATHOLOGY; TYROSINE KINASE; CRIZOTINIB; CHEMOTHERAPY; CERITINIB; EGFR; PROGRESSION	Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) is an oncogenic driver in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Chromosomal rearrangements involving the ALK gene occur in up to 4% of nonsquamous NSCLC patients and lead to constitutive activation of the ALK signalling pathway. ALK-positive NSCLC is found in relatively young patients, with a median age of 50 years. Patients frequently have brain metastasis. Targeted inhibition of the ALK pathway prolongs progression-free survival in patients with ALK-positive advanced NSCLC. The results of several recent clinical trials confirm the efficacy and safety benefit of crizotinib and ceritinib in this population. Canadian oncologists support the following consensus statement: All patients with advanced nonsquamous NSCLC (excluding pure neuroendocrine carcinoma) should be tested for the presence of an ALK rearrangement. If an ALK rearrangement is present, treatment with a targeted ALK inhibitor in the first-line setting is recommended. As patients become resistant to first-generation ALK inhibitors, other treatments, including second-generation ALK inhibitors can be considered.	[Melosky, B.; Ionescu, D.

High estrogen and chronic haloperidol lead to greater amphetamine-induced BOLD activation in awake, amphetamine-sensitized female rats	HORMONES AND BEHAVIOR			English	Article						Schizophrenia; Estradiol; Dopamine; fMRI; Antipsychotic; Ovariectomy	DOPAMINE RECEPTOR SENSITIVITY; TIME-DEPENDENT SENSITIZATION; VENTRAL TEGMENTAL AREA; CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; BEHAVIORAL SENSITIZATION; ROTATIONAL BEHAVIOR; NUCLEUS-ACCUMBENS; ANTIPSYCHOTIC-DRUGS; SEX-DIFFERENCES; MESSENGER-RNA	The ovarian hormone estrogen has been implicated in schizophrenia symptomatology. Low levels of estrogen are associated with an increase in symptom severity, while exogenous estrogen increases the efficacy of antipsychotic medication, pointing at a possible interaction between estrogen and the dopaminergic system. The aim of this study is to further investigate this interaction in an animal model of some aspects of schizophrenia using awake functional magnetic resonance imaging. Animals receiving 17 beta-estradiol and haloperidol were scanned and BOLD activity was assessed in response to amphetamine. High 17 beta-estradiol replacement and chronic haloperidol treatment showed increased BOLD activity in regions of interest and neural networks associated with schizophrenia (hippocampal formations, habenula, amygdala, hypothalamus etc.), compared with low, or no 17 beta-estradiol. These data show that chronic haloperidol treatment has a sensitizing effect, possibly on the dopaminergic system, and this effect is dependent on hormonal status, with high 17 beta-estradiol showing the greatest BOLD increase. Furthermore, these experiments further support the use of imaging techniques in studying schizophrenia, as modeled in the rat, but can be extended to addiction and other disorders.

Central nervous system involvement by multiple myeloma: A multi-institutional retrospective study of 172 patients in daily clinical practice	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF HEMATOLOGY			English	Article							OF-THE-LITERATURE; CHROMOSOMAL-ABNORMALITIES; INTRATHECAL CHEMOTHERAPY; MENINGEAL MYELOMA; AGENTS; MANIFESTATIONS; BENDAMUSTINE; ASSOCIATION; THALIDOMIDE; INVASION	The multicenter retrospective study conducted in 38 centers from 20 countries including 172 adult patients with CNS MM aimed to describe the clinical and pathological characteristics and outcomes of patients with multiple myeloma (MM) involving the central nervous system (CNS). Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify prognostic factors for survival. The median time from MM diagnosis to CNS MM diagnosis was 3 years. Thirty-eight patients (22%) were diagnosed with CNS involvement at the time of initial MM diagnosis and 134 (78%) at relapse/progression. Upon diagnosis of CNS MM, 97% patients received initial therapy for CNS disease, of which 76% received systemic therapy, 36% radiotherapy and 32% intrathecal therapy. After a median follow-up of 3.5 years, the median overall survival (OS) from the onset of CNS involvement for the entire group was 7 months. Untreated and treated patients had median OS of 2 and 8 months, respectively (P < 0.001). At least one previous line of therapy for MM before the diagnosis of CNS disease and > 1 cytogenetic abnormality detected by FISH were independently associated with worse OS. The median OS for patients with 0, 1 and 2 of these risk factors were 25 months, 5.5 months and 2 months, respectively (P < 0.001). Neurological manifestations, not considered chemotherapy-related, observed at any time after initial diagnosis of MM should raise a suspicion of CNS involvement. Although prognosis is generally poor, the survival of previously untreated patients and patients with favorable cytogenetic profile might be prolonged due to systemic treatment and/or radiotherapy.

The study is based on the conceptual framework VADA WHO which focuses on the development of friendly built and technological environments for seniors. Three elderly people participated in the study, recruited from an ongoing project, The Citizen Intervention in Community Living (APIC), in the presence of their personalized attendant. The study shows the feasibility of the method in terms of its acceptability and resources mobilized. It shows its relevance to access additional data that would have been difficult to obtain using others methods (e.g., semi-structured interview), such as the identification of the strategies used by the participants to address the obstacles encountered (avoidance, travel planning, use of physical and preventative support of the personalized attendant).

This paper presents a model predictive control (MPC) scheme incorporating neural-dynamic optimization to achieve trajectory tracking of nonholonomic mobile robots (NMRs). By using the derived tracking-error kinematics of nonholonomic robots, the proposed MPC approach is iteratively transformed as a constrained quadratic programming (QP) problem, and then a primal-dual neural network is used to solve this QP problem over a finite receding horizon. The applied neural-dynamic optimization can make the cost function of MPC converge to the exact optimal values of the formulated constrained QP. Compared with the existing fast MPC, which requires repeatedly calculating the Hessian matrix of the Langragian and then solves a quadratic program. The computation complexity reaches O(n(3)), while the proposed neural-dynamic optimization contains O(n(2)) operations. Finally, extensive experiments are provided to illustrate that the MPC scheme has an effective performance on a real mobile robot system.

Although research into endogenous cannabinoid systems and potential cannabinoid pharmaceuticals is slowly increasing, there has been intense societal interest in making herbal (plant) cannabis available for medicinal use; 23 U.S. States and all Canadian provinces currently permit use in some clinical contexts. Whether or not individual professionals support the clinical use of herbal cannabis, all clinicians will encounter patients who elect to use it and therefore need to be prepared to advise them on cannabis-related clinical issues despite limited evidence to guide care. Expanded research on cannabis is needed to better determine the individual and public health effects of increasing use of herbal cannabis and to advance understanding of the pharmaceutical potential of cannabinoids as medications. This article reviews clinical, research, and policy issues related to herbal cannabis to support clinicians in thoughtfully advising and caring for patients who use cannabis, and it examines obstacles and opportunities to expand research on the health effects of herbal cannabis and cannabinoids. Perspective: Herbal cannabis is increasingly available for clinical use in the United States despite continuing controversies over its efficacy and safety. This article explores important considerations in the use of plant Cannabis to better prepare clinicians to care for patients who use it, and identifies needed directions for research.

Dopamine Reuptake Inhibitors in Parkinson's Disease: A Review of Nonhuman Primate Studies and Clinical Trials	JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY AND EXPERIMENTAL THERAPEUTICS			English	Review							RAT-BRAIN SYNAPTOSOMES; MPTP-TREATED PRIMATES; BIOGENIC-AMINE UPTAKE; MOTOR COMPLICATIONS; DOUBLE-BLIND; IN-VITRO; LEVODOPA; ANTIDEPRESSANTS; DYSKINESIA; NOMIFENSINE	Striatal dopamine deficiency is the core feature of the pathology of Parkinson's disease (PD), and dopamine replacement with L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) is the mainstay of PD treatment. Unfortunately, chronic L-DOPA administration is marred by the emergence of dyskinesia and wearing-off. Alternatives to L-DOPA for alleviation of parkinsonism are of interest, although none can match the efficacy of L-DOPA to date. Catechol-O-methyltransferase and monoamine oxidase inhibitors are currently used to alleviate wearing-off, but they do not increase "on-time" without exacerbating dyskinesia. Alternate approaches to dopamine replacement in parkinsonism generally (and to wearing-off and dyskinesia, specifically) are therefore urgently needed. Inasmuch as they increase synaptic dopamine levels, dopamine transporter (DAT) inhibitors, whether they are selective or have actions on noradrenaline or serotonin transporters, theoretically represent an attractive way to alleviate parkinsonism per se and potentially enhance L-DOPA antiparkinsonian action (provided that sufficient dopamine terminals remain within the striatum). Several nonhuman primate studies and clinical trials have been performed to evaluate the potential of DAT inhibitors for PD. In this article, we review nonhuman primate studies and clinical trials, we summarize the current knowledge of DAT inhibitors in PD, and we propose a hypothesis as to how tailoring the selectivity of DAT inhibitors might maximize the benefits of DAT inhibition in PD.

No structured critical evaluation has been conducted to study this association yet. The aim of this meta-analysis was to systematically examine the association of poor gait performance with incidence of dementia. Methods: An English and French Medline search was conducted in June 2015, with no limit of date, using the medical subject headings terms "Gait" OR "Gait Disorders, Neurologic" OR "Gait Apraxia" OR "Gait Ataxia" AND "Dementia" OR "Frontotemporal Dementia" OR "Dementia, Multi-Infarct" OR "Dementia, Vascular" OR "Alzheimer Disease" OR "Lewy Body Disease" OR "Frontotemporal Dementia With Motor Neuron Disease" (Supplementary Concept). Poor gait performance was defined by standardized tests of walking, and dementia was diagnosed according to international consensus criteria. Four etiologies of dementia were identified: any dementia, Alzheimer disease (AD), vascular dementia (VaD), and non-AD (ie, pooling VaD, mixed dementias, and other dementias). Fixed effects meta-analyses were performed on the estimates in order to generate summary values. Results: Of the 796 identified abstracts, 12 (1.5%) were included in this systematic review and meta-analysis. Poor gait performance predicted dementia [pooled hazard ratio (HR) combined with relative risk and odds ratio = 1.53 with P < .001 for any dementia, pooled HR = 1.79 with P < .001 for VaD, HR = 1.89 with P value < .001 for non-AD]. Findings were weaker for predicting AD (HR = 1.03 with P value = .004). Conclusions: This meta-analysis provides evidence that poor gait performance predicts dementia. This association depends on the type of dementia; poor gait performance is a stronger predictor of non-AD dementias than AD. (C) 2016 AMDA -The Society for Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine.

Cogmed working memory training and ADHD	PSYCHOLOGIE FRANCAISE			French	Article						Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder; (ADHD); Working memory training; Cogmed program; Children; Adolescents	ATTENTION-DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; DEFICIT HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; CONTROLLED-TRIAL; SECONDARY MEMORY; CHILDREN; ADOLESCENTS; CAPACITY; BEHAVIOR; COMPONENT; OUTCOMES	Introduction. - Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a prevalent neurodevelopmental disorder. Inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity are key symptoms of ADHD. It is typically associated with working memory deficits at the cognitive level. For this reason, interventions have been designed to train working memory in ADHD. Currently, Cogmed Working Memory Training program is the most commonly used and studied program in clinical practice and research. This program is proposed as an intervention for ADHD that targets working memory deficits with specific exercises through intensive training sessions. Objectives. - The goal of this literature review is to examine the effects of the Cogmed program in children and adolescents with ADHD on working memory, inhibition, non-verbal reasoning, attention functioning, ADHD symptoms and academic achievement. All existing studies on the subject that included a control group (n=8) are reviewed. Results. - It is clear from most studies that Cogmed training program increases and verbal and visuospatial working memory (or the phonological loop and visuospatial sketchpad in Baddeley's model (1986, 2007), among ADHD participants. However, transfer of learning is not demonstrated on other components of working memory that are not directly targeted by the program such as the central executive described in Baddeley's model or the secondary memory defined by Unsworth & Engle (2007). With regards to far transfer measures, results are controversial for inhibition, non-verbal reasoning, ADHD symptoms reported by parents, and reading abilities. No improvement is demonstrated for attentional capacities, ADHD symptoms reported by teachers and mathematic reasoning. Conclusion. - Cogmed training improves verbal and visuospatial working memory, two cognitive functions that play an important role in ADHD. However, Cogmed's exercises need to be modified in order to train more complex working memory components such as the central executive (Baddeley, 1986, 2007) and the secondary memory (Unsworth & Engle, 2007), which are more impaired in ADHD than the phonological loop and visuospatial sketchpad. Another approach would be to design programs that can tackle a larger range of cognitive functions that are impaired in ADHD (e.g., inhibition). In future, studies evaluating such modified programs, direct observation instruments that are more sensitive to shortterm changes need to be included. Follow-up measures should also be systematically included. (C) 2015 Societe francaise de psychologie. Published by Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

Multilevel Dynamic Generalized Structured Component Analysis for Brain Connectivity Analysis in Functional Neuroimaging Data	PSYCHOMETRIKA			English	Article						generalized structured component analysis; multilevel analysis; structural equation modeling; alternating least squares (ALS) algorithm; brain connectivity analysis; time series data; functional neuroimaging; multi-subject data		We extend dynamic generalized structured component analysis (GSCA) to enhance its data-analytic capability in structural equation modeling of multi-subject time series data. Time series data of multiple subjects are typically hierarchically structured, where time points are nested within subjects who are in turn nested within a group. The proposed approach, named multilevel dynamic GSCA, accommodates the nested structure in time series data. Explicitly taking the nested structure into account, the proposed method allows investigating subject-wise variability of the loadings and path coefficients by looking at the variance estimates of the corresponding random effects, as well as fixed loadings between observed and latent variables and fixed path coefficients between latent variables. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach by applying the method to the multi-subject functional neuroimaging data for brain connectivity analysis, where time series data-level measurements are nested within subjects.

Population-based Analysis of Treatment and Survival in Women Presenting With Brain Metastasis at Initial Breast Cancer Diagnosis	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ONCOLOGY-CANCER CLINICAL TRIALS			English	Article						breast cancer; brain metastasis; de novo stage IV breast cancer; treatment; survival	NERVOUS-SYSTEM METASTASES; PROGNOSTIC-FACTORS; TREATMENT OUTCOMES; PRIMARY TUMOR; STAGE-IV; VALIDATION; MANAGEMENT; SURGERY; THERAPY	Purpose: Brain metastasis at initial breast cancer diagnosis is rare. This study aims to evaluate the clinical characteristics of these patients and identify prognostic and treatment factors associated with improved survival. Methods: Subjects were 35 women referred from 1996 to 2005 with newly diagnosed breast cancer with synchronous brain metastasis. Overall survival (OS) and brain progression-free survival were examined using Kaplan-Meier methods and compared between subgroups with different clinicopathologic and treatment characteristics using log-rank tests. Results: Median age was 65 years. Whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT) alone was used in 25 patients, surgical resection and postoperative WBRT in 5 patients, and no or unknown treatment in 5 patients. Patients who underwent cranial resection were more likely to have solitary brain metastasis (P = 0.003) and no visceral involvement (P = 0.006). Overall, median OS was 6.8 months and median brain progression-free survival was 6.5 months (range, 0.7 to 54 mo). Median OS were 15 months with surgery and postoperative WBRT, 5 months with WBRT alone, and 3 months with no brain treatment. Longer OS was observed with age below 65 years versus 65 years and above (11 vs. 5 mo, P = 0.046), 0 to 1 versus >= 2 sites of extracranial metastasis (10 vs. 3 mo, P = 0.047), and diagnosis from 2001 to 2005 versus 1996 to 2000 (10 vs. 3 mo, P = 0.018). A trend toward improved OS was observed in patients with no visceral involvement (11 vs. 4 mo, P = 0.09). Conclusions: In this unique cohort presenting with breast cancer and synchronous brain metastasis, longer survival were observed with young age, limited extracranial metastasis, and no visceral disease. These characteristics may be used to select candidates for more aggressive treatment.

However, detailed quantification of ecological complexity is still limited. Here we assess the spatio-temporal distribution of tropical fruits and young leaves, two primary chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) foods, focusing on the predictability of their availability in individual trees. Using up to 20 years of information on monthly availability of young leaf, unripe and ripe fruit in plant species consumed by chimpanzees from tropical forests in East, Central, and West Africa, we estimated: (1) the forest-wide frequency of occurrence of each food type and (2) the predictability of finding ripe fruit-bearing trees, focusing on the timing, frequency, and amount of ripe fruit present. In all three forests, at least half of all encountered trees belonged to species that chimpanzees were known to feed on. However, the proportion of these trees bearing young leaves and fruit fluctuated widely between months. Ripe fruit was the most ephemeral food source, and trees that had more than half of their crown filled were at least nine times scarcer than other trees. In old growth forests only one large ripe fruit crop was on average encountered per 10 km. High levels of inter-individual variation in the number of months that fruit was present existed, and in some extreme cases individuals bore ripe fruit more than seven times as often as conspecifics. Some species showed substantially less variation in such ripe fruit production frequencies and fruit quantity than others. We hypothesize that chimpanzees employ a suite of cognitive mechanisms, including abilities to: (1) generalize or classify food trees; (2) remember the relative metrics of quantity and frequency of fruit production across years; and (3) flexibly plan return times to feeding trees to optimize high-energy food consumption in individual trees, and efficient travel between them.

Obesity is accompanied by a chronic inflammatory state that increases the risk of metabolic diseases such as insulin-resistance and type 2 diabetes. Over the past two decades, interest in immunomodulatory cytokines as potential mediators and/or targets for treatment or prevention of obesity and metabolic syndrome has increased. In this review, we summarize studies that revealed the effects of LIF family cytokines on adipose tissue, energy expenditure and food intake, highlighting the importance of gp130/LIFR beta signaling in obesity and obesity-related metabolic diseases.

Symptoms of HE include mild cognitive impairment, stupor and coma. Morphological changes to neuroglia (both astrocytes and microglia) occur in HE consisting of cytotoxic brain edema (astrocyte swelling) in acute liver failure and Alzheimer type-2 astrocytosis in cirrhosis. Visual-evoked responses in animals with liver failure and HE manifest striking similarities to those in animals treated with agonists of the GABA-A receptor complex. Neurosteroids are synthesized in brain following activation of translocator protein (TSPO), a mitochondrial neuroglial cholesterol-transporter protein. TSPO sites are activated in both animal models of HE as well as in autopsied brain tissue from HE patients. Activation of TSPO sites results in increased cholesterol transport into the mitochondrion followed by stimulation of a metabolic pathway culminating in the synthesis of allopregnanolone (ALLO) and tetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone (THDOC), neurosteroids with potent positive allosteric modulatory action on the GABA-A receptor complex. Concentrations of ALLO and THDOC in brain tissue from mice with HE resulting from toxic liver injury are sufficient to induce sedation in animals of the same species and significant increases in concentrations of ALLO have been reported in autopsied brain tissue from cirrhotic patients with HE leading to the proposal that "increased GABAergic tone" in HE results from that increased brain concentrations of this neurosteroid. Agents with the potential to decrease neurosteroid synthesis and/or prevent their modulatory actions on the GABA-A receptor complex may provide novel approaches to the management and treatment of HE. Such agents include indomethacin, benzodiazepine receptor inverse agonists and a novel series of compounds known as GABA-A receptor-modulating steroid antagonists (GAMSA). (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Type I interferons and microbial metabolites of tryptophan modulate astrocyte activity and central nervous system inflammation via the aryl hydrocarbon receptor	NATURE MEDICINE			English	Article							EXPERIMENTAL AUTOIMMUNE ENCEPHALOMYELITIS; BLOOD-BRAIN-BARRIER; REGULATORY T-CELLS; NF-KAPPA-B; MULTIPLE-SCLEROSIS; MYELOID CELLS; BETA; DIFFERENTIATION; EXPRESSION; RESPONSES	Astrocytes have important roles in the central nervous system (CNS) during health and disease. Through genome-wide analyses we detected a transcriptional response to type I interferons (IFN-Is) in astrocytes during experimental CNS autoimmunity and also in CNS lesions from patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). IFN-I signaling in astrocytes reduces inflammation and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) disease scores via the ligand-activated transcription factor aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) and the suppressor of cytokine signaling 2 (SOCS2). The anti-inflammatory effects of nasally administered interferon (IFN)-beta are partly mediated by AHR. Dietary tryptophan is metabolized by the gut microbiota into AHR agonists that have an effect on astrocytes to limit CNS inflammation. EAE scores were increased following ampicillin treatment during the recovery phase, and CNS inflammation was reduced in antibiotic-treated mice by supplementation with the tryptophan metabolites indole, indoxyl-3-sulfate, indole-3-propionic acid and indole-3-aldehyde, or the bacterial enzyme tryptophanase. In individuals with MS, the circulating levels of AHR agonists were decreased. These findings suggest that IFN-Is produced in the CNS function in combination with metabolites derived from dietary tryptophan by the gut flora to activate AHR signaling in astrocytes and suppress CNS inflammation.

The proximity and morphological complexity of these two regions make proper identification and isolation of the loci of activation extremely difficult. The use of group averaging methods in human neuroimaging might contribute to this problem. The result has been heterogeneous labeling of this region as aI, fO, or aI/fO, and a discussion of results oriented towards either cognitive or interoceptive functions depending on labeling. In the present article, we adapted the spatial preprocessing of functional magnetic resonance imaging data to account for group averaging artifacts and performed a subject-by-subject analysis in three performance monitoring tasks. Results show that functional activity related to feedback or action monitoring consistently follows local morphology in this region and demonstrate that the activity is located predominantly in the fO rather than in the aI. From these results, we propose that a full understanding of the respective role of aI and fO would benefit from increased spatial resolution and subject-by-subject analysis. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

We systematically reviewed 78 functional neuroimaging (fMRI and PET) studies of meditation, and used activation likelihood estimation to meta-analyze 257 peak foci from 31 experiments involving 527 participants. We found reliably dissociable patterns of brain activation and deactivation for four common styles of meditation (focused attention, mantra recitation, open monitoring, and compassion/loving-kindness), and suggestive differences for three others (visualization, sense-withdrawal, and non-dual awareness practices). Overall, dissociable activation patterns are congruent with the psychological and behavioral aims of each practice. Some brain areas are recruited consistently across multiple techniques including insula, pre/supplementary motor cortices, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, and frontopolar cortex but convergence is the exception rather than the rule. A preliminary effect-size meta-analysis found medium effects for both activations (d = 0.59) and deactivations (d = -0.74), suggesting potential practical significance. Our meta-analysis supports the neurophysiological dissociability of meditation practices, but also raises many methodological concerns and suggests avenues for future research. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Arterial Spin Labeling Perfusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging Performed in Acute Perinatal Stroke Reveals Hyperperfusion Associated With Ischemic Injury	STROKE			English	Article						cerebral blood flow; infant, newborn; magnetic resonance imaging; perfusion; stroke	CEREBRAL SINOVENOUS THROMBOSIS; COMPLEX PARTIAL SEIZURES; NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS; NATIONAL INSTITUTE; NEONATAL BRAIN; SPECT; MRI; THROMBOLYSIS; WORKSHOP; INSIGHTS	Background and Purpose-Perfusion-weighted imaging in adults with acute stroke often reveals hypoperfusion in the ischemic core and in a surrounding area of nondiffusion-restricted penumbral tissue. Perinatal stroke is common, but the perfusion pattern is rarely documented. We aimed to describe the perfusion pattern in newborns with perinatal stroke. Methods-Neonates with clinical features of acute stroke underwent magnetic resonance imaging. Perfusion data were obtained using pseudocontinuous arterial spin labeling. Strokes were classified as arterial, venous, or both. Core infarction was determined by the presence of restricted diffusion on diffusion-weighted imaging. Perfusion-weighted imaging and susceptibility-weighted imaging signal in the ischemic area were visually compared with the homologous region in the contralesional hemisphere. Electroencephalogram data were evaluated for seizure activity. Results-In 25 neonates with acute stroke, 8 of 11 (73%) with arterial ischemic stroke demonstrated hyperperfusion, 1 of 9 (11%) with venous stroke, and 4 of 5 (80%) with both. Hypoperfusion was observed in 3 of 9 (33%) with venous and none with arterial ischemic stroke. Perfusion was normal in 4 of 9 (45%) with venous and 1 of 5 (20%) with both. Twenty-ne of 24 patients (88%) with electroencephalogram data had either electrographic seizures or focal sharp waves in the ipsilesional hemisphere (11/11 arterial ischemic stroke, 6/9 venous, and 4/5 both). Conclusions-Perfusion-weighted imaging can be obtained in neonates with acute stroke and often reveals hyperperfusion in the infarct core. Penumbra in arterial ischemic stroke is seldom found. Hyperperfusion may be caused by poststroke reperfusion or to neuronal hyperexcitability of stroke-associated seizure. Its identification may be useful for consideration of therapy for acute neonatal stroke.

However, in certain patients, DL may be difficult or impossible. The Bonfils Rigid Fiberscope (R) (BRF) is an alternative intubation device, the design of which raises the question of whether factors that predict difficult DL also predict difficult BRF. We undertook this study to determine which demographic, morphologic, and morphometric factors predict difficult intubation with the BRF. METHODS: Four hundred adult patients scheduled for elective surgery were recruited. Patients were excluded if awake intubation, rapid sequence induction, or induction without neuromuscular blocking agents was planned. Data were recorded, including age, sex, weight, height, American Society of Anesthesiologist classification, history of snoring and sleep apnea, Mallampati class, upper lip bite test score, interincisor, thyromental and sternothyroid distances, manubriomental distances in flexion and extension, neck circumference, maximal neck flexion and extension, neck skinfold thickness at the cricoid cartilage, and Cormack and Lehane grade obtained via DL after paralysis was confirmed. Quality of glottic visualization (good or poor), as well as the number of intubation attempts and time to successful intubation with the BRF, was noted. Univariate analyses were performed to evaluate the association between patient characteristics and time required for intubation. Variables that exhibited a significant correlation were included in a multivariate analysis using a standard least squares model. A P < 0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: Glottic visualization with the BRF was good in 396 of 400 (99%) cases. On the first attempt, 390 patients were successfully intubated with the BRF; 6 patients required > 1 attempt; 4 patients could not be intubated by using the BRF alone. These 4 patients were intubated by using a combination of DL and BRF (2 patients), DL and a Frova bougie (1 patient), and DL and an endotracheal tube shaped with a semirigid stylet (1 patient). Mean time for successful intubation was 26 +/- 13 seconds. Multivariate analysis showed that decreased mouth opening (P = 0.008), increased body mass index (P = 0.011), and higher Cormack and Lehane grade (P = 0.038) predicted longer intubation times, whereas shorter thyromental distance predicted slightly shorter intubation times (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Mouth opening, body mass index, and high Cormack and Lehane grade predict longer intubation times, as with DL. Decreasing thyromental distance predicts slightly shorter intubation times with the BRF, possibly because of a design initially optimized for a pediatric population with receding chins. These findings, along with the high success rate of BRF in this study, and the possibility of further increasing success rates by combining BRF with DL, help define the role of BRF intubation in contemporary airway management.

Mice Lacking GPR88 Show Motor Deficit, Improved Spatial Learning, and Low Anxiety Reversed by Delta Opioid Antagonist	BIOLOGICAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						Ethological scoring of anxiety; Gene clustering; GPR88 agonist-induced GTP gamma S binding; Medium spiny neurons; Psychiatric disorders; Spatial learning	ADENOSINE A(2A) RECEPTORS; CENTRAL EXTENDED AMYGDALA; C-TERMINAL DOMAINS; DORSAL STRIATUM; STRIATOPALLIDAL NEURONS; SELECTIVE INTERACTIONS; PROTRACTED ABSTINENCE; DEPENDENT BEHAVIORS; OBJECT RECOGNITION; PARKINSON-DISEASE	BACKGROUND: GPR88 is an orphan G protein coupled receptor highly enriched in the striatum, and previous studies have focused on GPR88 function in striatal physiology. The receptor is also expressed in other brain areas, and here we examined whether GPR88 function extends beyond striatal-mediated responses. METHODS: We created Gpr88 knockout mice and examined both striatal and extrastriatal regions at molecular and cellular levels. We also tested striatum-, hippocampus-, and amygdala-dependent behaviors in Gpr88(-/-) mice using extensive behavioral testing. RESULTS: We found increased G protein coupling for delta opioid receptor (DOR) and mu opioid, but not other Gi/o coupled receptors, in the striatum of Gpr88 knockout mice. We also found modifications in gene transcription, dopamine and serotonin contents, and dendritic morphology inside and outside the striatum. Behavioral testing confirmed striatal deficits (hyperactivity, stereotypies, motor impairment in rotarod). In addition, mutant mice performed better in spatial tasks dependent on hippocampus (Y-maze, novel object recognition, dual solution cross-maze) and also showed markedly reduced levels of anxiety (elevated plus maze, marble burying, novelty suppressed feeding). Strikingly, chronic blockade of DOR using naltrindole partially improved motor coordination and normalized spatial navigation and anxiety of Gpr88(-/-) mice. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that GPR88 is implicated in a large repertoire of behavioral responses that engage motor activity, spatial learning, and emotional processing. Our data also reveal functional antagonism between GPR88 and DOR activities in vivo. The therapeutic potential of GPR88 therefore extends to cognitive and anxiety disorders, possibly in interaction with other receptor systems.

Many occupational therapists contribute to the assessment of competence to take care of oneself and manage one's affairs, but few guidelines exist regarding this practice with adults who have experienced a traumatic brain injury (TBI). Purpose. This study explored the ability of the Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Profile (IADL Profile) to capture competence following a TBI. Method. Task performance on the IADL Profile of a 46-year-old man (ML) who was found to be incompetent following a severe TBI was compared to eight control subjects (mean age 49.3 +/- 4.2 years). The IADL Profile scores, observable behaviours, and verbalizations were compared using descriptive statistics (M, SD) and qualitative analyses. Results. The independence level of ML was lower than that of the control subjects on seven of the eight tasks of the IADL Profile (p <.05), especially for preparing a hot meal and creating a budget. ML demonstrated difficulties that impacted his performance on many tasks, and he had difficulty critiquing his results. Implications. The IADL Profile could be used as part of a functional assessment to document competence.

Statins downregulate cholesterol synthesis and upregulate hepatic mRNA levels of LDL receptor (LDLR) and proprotein convertase subtilisin-kexin 9 (PCSK9), a validated enhancer of LDLR protein degradation. Herein, we summarize recent discoveries of the biological properties of PCSK9 in both health and disease states. Recent findings PCSK9 downregulation of the LDLR protein likely explains the observed protective effect of the loss of PCSK9 in reducing lipoprotein(a) and incidence of septic shock. Injectable inhibitory PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies are now prescribed to hypercholesterolemic patients that do not reach target levels of LDL-C with available drugs. PCSK9 also reduces the levels of other receptors, for example, VLDL receptor (VLDLR), ApoER2, CD36, and CD81. The efficacy of the upregulation of LDLR and VLDLR cell surface levels in the absence of PCSK9 is both tissue and sex dependent. As LDLR, CD81, and VLDLR are hepatitis C receptors, PCSK9 may protect against certain viral infections. Summary New functions of PCSK9 and other receptor targets are beginning to emerge to explain the observed changes in LDL-C and triglycerides. The effect of PCSK9 loss-of-function on glucose metabolism, factors that regulate the expression of PCSK9, and the roles of PCSK9 in other tissues, for example, intestine, kidney, and brain require further investigations.

Here, we identified the cytokine receptor OSMR as a direct target gene of the transcription factor STAT3 in mouse astrocytes and human brain tumor stem cells (BTSCs). We found that OSMR functioned as an essential co-receptor for EGFRvIII. OSMR formed a physical complex with EGFRvIII, and depletion of OSMR impaired EGFRvIII-STAT3 signaling. Conversely, pharmacological inhibition of EGFRvIII phosphorylation inhibited the EGFRvIII-OSMR interaction and activation of STAT3. EGFRvIII-OSMR signaling in tumors operated constitutively, whereas EGFR-OSMR signaling in nontumor cells was synergistically activated by the ligands EGF and OSM. Finally, knockdown of OSMR strongly suppressed cell proliferation and tumor growth of mouse glioblastoma cells and human BTSC xenografts in mice, and prolonged the lifespan of these mice. Our findings identify OSMR as a critical regulator of glioblastoma tumor growth that orchestrates a feed-forward signaling mechanism with EGFRvIII and STAT3 to drive tumorigenesis.

Anastomosis Between the Ascending Pharyngeal Artery and the Posterior Inferior Cerebellar Artery Through the Jugular Foramen: A Cadaveric Observation	OPERATIVE NEUROSURGERY			English	Article						Ascending pharyngeal artery; Jugular branch of the ascending pharyngeal artery; Posterior inferior cerebellar artery; Vascular anastomosis	ORIGIN	BACKGROUND: The ascending pharyngeal artery (APA) may, in very rare cases, supply the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA). In reported cases, when such is the case, the ipsilateral vertebral artery (VA) does not supply the PICA, and most of the time it is hypoplastic. OBJECTIVE: To describe a unique cadaveric observation of a direct anastomosis between the posterior division (neuromeningeal) of the jugular branch of the APA and the PICA, where the PICA is also supplied by a normal-size VA. METHODS: A direct connection between the APA and the PICA was examined in a cadaveric specimen using a 3-dimensional endoscope and a surgical microscope. RESULTS: The enlarged jugular branch of the posterior division of the APA entered intracranially via the jugular foramen in its pars vascularis. It then connected directly with the lateral medullary segment of the PICA. The first segment of the PICA originated from a left vertebral artery of normal size and continued its normal course beyond the junction with the jugular branch of the APA. CONCLUSION: Both the VA and the jugular branch of the APA may simultaneously supply the PICA territory. Recognition of this anatomic variant is relevant when planning surgical or endovascular treatments.

This literature has yielded a number of influential models of bilingual semantic memory. However, extant models provide limited predictions about the emergence of lexical organization in bilingual first language acquisition (BFLA). Empirical evidence from monolingual infants suggests that lexical networks emerge early in development as children integrate phonological and semantic information. These findings tell us little about the interaction between 2 languages in early bilingual memory. To date, an understanding of when and how languages interact in early bilingual development is lacking. In this literature review, we present research documenting lexical-semantic development across monolingual and bilingual infants. This is followed by a discussion of current models of bilingual language representation and organization and their ability to account for the available empirical evidence. Together, these theoretical and empirical accounts inform and highlight unexplored areas of research and guide future work on early bilingual memory.

Yet the specific neurostructural changes associated with RBD in PD patients remain to be revealed by neuroimaging. Here we identified such neurostructural alterations by comparing large samples of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans in 69 PD patients with probable RBD, 240 patients without RBD and 138 healthy controls, using deformation-based morphometry (p < 0.05 corrected for multiple comparisons). All data were extracted from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative. PD patients with probable RBD showed smaller volumes than patients without RBD and than healthy controls in the pontomesencephalic tegmentum, medullary reticular formation, hypothalamus, thalamus, putamen, amygdala and anterior cingulate cortex. These results demonstrate that RBD is associated with a prominent loss of volume in the pontomesencephalic tegmentum, where cholinergic, GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons are located and implicated in the promotion of REM sleep and muscle atonia. It is additionally associated with more widespread atrophy in other subcortical and cortical regions whose loss also likely contributes to the altered regulation of sleep-wake states and motor activity underlying RBD in PD patients.

In particular, we describe behavior as parallel processes of competition and selection among potential action opportunities ('affordances') expressed at multiple levels of abstraction. Adaptive selection among currently available affordances is biased not only by predictions of their immediate outcomes and payoffs but also by predictions of what new affordances they will make available. This allows animals to purposively create new affordances that they can later exploit to achieve high-level goals, resulting in intentional action that links across multiple levels of control. Finally, we discuss how such a 'hierarchical affordance competition' process can be mapped to brain structure.

Overall, significant relationships between a subset of trait emotions (trait anger, trait anxiety) and personality traits (agreeableness, conscientiousness, and neuroticism) were found for four agent-directed emotions (enjoyment, pride, boredom, and neutral) though the relationships differed between pedagogical agents. These results demonstrate that some trait emotions and personality traits can be used to predict learners' emotions directed toward specific pedagogical agents (with different roles). Results provide suggestions for adapting pedagogical agents to support learners' (with certain characteristics; e.g., high in neuroticism or agreeableness) experience of adaptive emotions (e.g., enjoyment) and minimize their experience on non-adaptive emotions (e.g., boredom). Such an approach presents a scalable and easily implementable method for creating emotionally-adaptive, agent-based learning environments, and improving learner-pedagogical agent interactions in order to support learning.

In order to identify underlying genetic alterations and molecular mechanisms, we examined three family members affected by multinodular DNETs as well as 100 sporadic tumors from 96 patients, which had been referred to us as DNETs. We performed whole-exome sequencing on 46 tumors and targeted sequencing for hotspot FGFR1 mutations and BRAF p.V600E was used on the remaining samples. FISH, copy number variation assays and Sanger sequencing were used to validate the findings. By whole-exome sequencing of the familial cases, we identified a novel germline FGFR1 mutation, p.R661P. Somatic activating FGFR1 mutations (p.N546K or p.K656E) were observed in the tumor samples and further evidence for functional relevance was obtained by in silico modeling. The FGFR1 p.K656E mutation was confirmed to be in cis with the germline p.R661P variant. In 43 sporadic cases, in which the diagnosis of DNET could be confirmed on central blinded neuropathology review, FGFR1 alterations were also frequent and mainly comprised intragenic tyrosine kinase FGFR1 duplication and multiple mutants in cis (25/43; 58.1 %) while BRAF p.V600E alterations were absent (0/43). In contrast, in 53 cases, in which the diagnosis of DNET was not confirmed, FGFR1 alterations were less common (10/53; 19 %; p < 0.0001) and hotspot BRAF p.V600E (12/53; 22.6 %) (p < 0.001) prevailed. We observed overexpression of phospho-ERK in FGFR1 p.R661P and p.N546K mutant expressing HEK293 cells as well as FGFR1 mutated tumor samples, supporting enhanced MAP kinase pathway activation under these conditions. In conclusion, constitutional and somatic FGFR1 alterations and MAP kinase pathway activation are key events in the pathogenesis of DNET.

Most cases appear to be sporadic, but 5-10% of cases have a family history of the disease. High-throughput DNA sequencing and related genomic capture tools are methodological advances which have rapidly contributed to an acceleration in the discovery of genetic risk factors for both familial and sporadic ALS. It is interesting to note that as the number of ALS genes grows, many of the proteins they encode are in shared intracellular processes. This review will summarize some of the recent advances and gene discovery made in ALS.

Parabolic bursting is characterized by a slow wave in membrane potential that can underlie periodic clusters of action potentials with increased interspike interval at the beginning and at the end of each cluster. Irregular bursting is characterized by clusters of action potentials that are separated by varying durations of interburst intervals and a relatively stable baseline potential. Based on recent studies of isolated ionic currents, a stochastic Hodgkin-Huxley (HH)-like model for the GnRH neuron is developed to reproduce each mode of burst firing with an appropriate set of conductances. Model outcomes for bursting are in agreement with the experimental recordings in terms of interburst interval, interspike interval, active phase duration, and other quantitative properties specific to each mode of bursting. The model also shows similar outcomes in membrane potential to those seen experimentally when tetrodotoxin (TTX) is used to block action potentials during bursting, and when estradiol transitions cells exhibiting slow oscillations to irregular bursting mode in vitro. Based on the parameter values used to reproduce each mode of bursting, the model suggests that GnRH neurons can switch between the two through changes in the maximum conductance of certain ionic currents, notably the slow inward Ca2+ current I (s,) and the Ca2+ -activated K+ current I (KCa). Bifurcation analysis of the model shows that both modes of bursting are similar from a dynamical systems perspective despite differences in burst characteristics.

As a result of this case, we performed a prospective quality assurance audit to investigate the incidence of residual paralysis in the ICU in a similar population of cardiac surgery patients. A 73-yr-old woman (69 kg) underwent coronary artery bypass surgery under anesthesia induced with intravenous sufentanil 25 A mu g, midazolam 5 mg, ketamine 25 mg, and rocuronium 100 mg (followed by two additional 50-mg doses during surgery) and maintained with sevoflurane. Postoperatively in the ICU, the patient was initially sedated with propofol (50 mg center dot hr(-1)) but failed to awaken 90 min after its cessation. As train-of-four neurostimulation showed residual paralysis, she was re-sedated. Neostigmine 3 mg and glycopyrrolate 0.6 mg were administered, and she was extubated 30 min later. During this episode of residual paralysis, the patient was conscious and reported explicit memory of the events. She was discharged on day 7 without psychological distress related to her postoperative awake paralysis. We subsequently performed a prospective audit in 50 consecutive patients to determine the timing of NMB dosing and to quantify the incidence of residual paralysis after fast-track cardiac surgery. Of the 50 patients studied, 24 (48%) had received an NMB during the last hour of surgery and 33 (66%) had evidence of residual paralysis during the immediate postoperative period. Postoperative residual paralysis after fast-track cardiac surgery was common in our institution and likely contributed to the reported case of postoperative awake paralysis. We suggest that an NMB not be administered after intubation in fast-track patients. If given, however, it must be well communicated to the ICU team upon ICU admission. We further recommend routine assessment of neuromuscular function before sedation is weaned prior to extubation.

As per Quay and in light of Barkley's model, anxiety may have a protective effect on cognitive deficits and behaviors associated with ADHD. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of treating AD on cognitive deficits and behaviors associated with ADHD in children with both disorders. Twenty-four children with ADHD and AD were divided into two groups: treatment for AD, and wait list. Participants were assessed at pre-treatment, post-treatment, and 6-month follow-up with the ADIS-C, the CBCL, and neuropsychological measures. The results revealed a significant improvement in automatic response inhibition and flexibility, and a decrease in inattention/hyperactivity behaviors following the treatment for AD. No significant differences were observed in motor response inhibition, working memory, or attention deficits. The results do not seem to support Quay's hypothesis: treating AD did not exacerbate cognitive deficits and behaviors associated with ADHD in our sample.

We hypothesized that a-tDCS during DBT enhances learning performance compared to sham tDCS (s-tDCS). Methods: In a randomized, parallel design, we applied either a-tDCS (n = 13) or s-tDCS (n = 13) in a total of 26 young subjects while they perform the DBT. Task performance and error rates were compared between groups. Additionally, we investigated the effect of tDCS on the relationship between performance and kinematic variables capturing different aspects of task execution. Results: A-tDCS over M1 leg area promotes balance performance in a DBT relative to s-tDCS, indicated by higher performance and smaller error scores. Furthermore, a-tDCS seems to mediate the relationship between DBT performance and the kinematic variable velocity. Conclusions: Our findings provide novel evidence for the ability of tDCS to improve dynamic balance learning, a fact, particularly important in the context of treating balance and gait disorders. Significance: TDCS facilitates dynamic balance performance by strengthening the inverse relationship of performance and velocity, thus making tDCS one potential technique to improve walking ability or help to prevent falls in patients in the future.

We aimed to evaluate its timeliness, correlation, and predictive accuracy in relation to influenza activity in Quebec, Canada, 2010-2013. Our secondary objective was to use the same metrics to compare NI dispensing to visits for influenza-like illness (ILI) in emergency departments (EDs). Provincial weekly counts of positive influenza laboratory tests were used as a reference measure for the level of influenza circulation. We applied ARIMA models to account for serial correlation. We computed cross-correlations to measure the strengths of association and lead-lag relationships between NI dispensing, ILI ED visits, and our reference indicator. Finally, using an ARIMA model, we evaluated the ability of NI dispensing and ILI ED visits to predict laboratory-confirmed influenza. NI dispensing was significantly correlated (R= 0.68) with influenza activity with no lag. The maximal correlation of ILI ED visits was not as strong (R = 0.50). Both NI dispensing and ILI ED visits were significant predictors of laboratory-confirmed influenza in a multivariable model; predictive potential was greatest when NI counts were lagged to precede laboratory surveillance by 2 weeks. We conclude that NI dispensing data provides timely and valuable information for influenza surveillance.	[Papenburg, J.; Buckeridge, D.

De novo variants in sporadic cases of childhood onset schizophrenia	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF HUMAN GENETICS			English	Article							AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDERS; TUBULIN KINASE 1; INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY; SEQUENCING DATA; MUTATIONS; DISEASE; GENOME; EXPRESSION; RECEPTORS; BRAIN	Childhood-onset schizophrenia (COS), defined by the onset of illness before age 13 years, is a rare severe neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown etiology. Recently, sequencing studies have identified rare, potentially causative de novo variants in sporadic cases of adult-onset schizophrenia and autism. In this study, we performed exome sequencing of 17 COS trios in order to test whether de novo variants could contribute to this disease. We identified 20 de novo variants in 17 COS probands, which is consistent with the de novo mutation rate reported in the adult form of the disease. Interestingly, the missense de novo variants in COS have a high likelihood for pathogenicity and were enriched for genes that are less tolerant to variants. Among the genes found disrupted in our study, SEZ6, RYR2, GPR153, GTF2IRD1, TTBK1 and ITGA6 have been previously linked to neuronal function or to psychiatric disorders, and thus may be considered as COS candidate genes.

SE is a serious emergency condition that requires immediate intervention; therefore, identifying SE electrophysiological markers may translate in prompt care to stop it. Here, we analyzed the EEG signals recorded from the CA3 region of the hippocampus and the entorhinal cortex in rats that responded to systemic administration of 4-aminopyridine (4AP) by generating either isolated seizures or seizures progressing to SE. We found that high frequency oscillations (HFOs) - which can be categorized as ripples (80-200 Hz) and fast ripples (250-500 Hz) - had different patterns of occurrence in the two groups (n = 5 for each group). Specifically, fast ripples in CA3 and entorhinal cortex of the SE group occurred at higher rates than ripples, both during the ictal and post-ictal periods when compared to the HFOs recorded from the isolated seizure group. Our data reveal that different patterns of HFO occurrence can pinpoint seizures progressing to SE, thus suggesting the involvement of different neuronal networks at the termination of seizure discharges.

In the current study, we assessed age-related differences in the frequency and neural correlates of TUTs during a source memory encoding task, as well as age-related differences in the relationship between the neural correlates of TUTs and subsequent source forgetting effects (i.e., source misses). We found no age-related differences in frequency of TUTs during fMRI scanning. Moreover, TUT frequency at encoding was positively correlated with source misses at retrieval across age groups. In both age groups, brain regions including bilateral middle/superior frontal gyri and precuneus were activated to a greater extent during encoding for subsequent source misses versus source hits and during TUTs versus on-task episodes. Overall, our results reveal that, during a source memory encoding task in an fMRI environment, young and older adults exhibit a similar frequency of TUTs and that experiencing TUTs at encoding is associated with decreased retrieval performance. In addition, in both age groups, experiencing TUTs at encoding is associated with increased activation in some of the same regions that exhibit subsequent source forgetting effects.

We studied the distribution of cells and processes in the three spinal regions reported in the literature: the 8th vertebra used as a transection injury site, the 15th vertebra mainly used for motor cell recordings and also for crush injury, and the 24th vertebra used to record motor nerve activity. We used well-known transgenic lines in which expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP) is driven by promoters to hb9 and isl1 in motoneurons, alx/chx10 and evx1 interneurons, ngn1 in sensory neurons and olig2 in oligodendrocytes, as well as antibodies for neurons (HuC/D, NF and SV2) and glia (GFAP). In isl1:GFP fish, GFP-positive processes are retained in the upper part of ventral horns and two subsets of cell bodies are observed. The pattern of the transgene in hb9:GFP adults is more diffuse and fibers are present broadly through the adult spinal cord. In alx/chx10 and evx1 lines we respectively observed two and three different GFP-positive populations. Finally, the ngn1:GFP transgene identifies dorsal root ganglion and some cells in dorsal horns. Interestingly some GFP positive fibers in ngn1:GFP fish are located around Mauthner axons and their density seems to be related to a rostrocaudal gradient. Many other cell types have been described in embryos and need to be studied in adults. Our findings provide a reference for further studies on spinal cytoarchitecture. Combined with physiological, histological and pathological/traumatic approaches, these studies will help clarify the operation of spinal locomotor circuits of adult zebrafish.

Position statements and practice guidelines exist to guide the ICU care team in the pain assessment process. The patient's self-report of pain remains the gold standard measure for pain and should be obtained as often as possible. When self-report is impossible to obtain, observational pain scales including the Behavioural Pain Scale (BPS) and the Critical-Care Pain Observation Tool (CPOT) have been recommended for clinical use in the critically ill adult. However, their adaptation and validation in brain-injured and burn ICU patients is required. Family caregivers may help in the identification of pain-related behaviours and should be more involved in the ICU pain assessment process. Fluctuations in vital signs should only be considered as cues for further assessment of pain with appropriate tools, and may better represent adverse events of severe pain. Other physiologic measures of pain should be explored in the ICU, and pupillometry appears as a promising technique to further study. Implementation of systematic pain assessment approaches using tools adapted to the patient's ability to communicate and condition has shown positive effects on ICU pain practices and patient outcomes, but randomised control trials are needed to confirm these conclusions.

We examined the implications of variations of selected, dopamine-relevant polymorphisms (DRD2 Taq1A, DRD4 7R, and COMT) for risk of substance abuse in women with binge purge eating syndromes. We genotyped 183 women (66.1% showing full-threshold BN and 33.9% showing sub-syndromic variants), and assessed lifetime presence of alcohol, cannabis, cocaine, and stimulant abuse or dependence using structured interviews. Tests for main and interaction effects of various allele combinations revealed that individuals who carried high function COMT and low-function DRD4 7R alleles (a combination expected to be associated with higher risk) did indeed show more lifetime substance abuse and, specifically, more cannabis abuse. Our findings suggest that a gene combination that, in theory, codes for low levels of dopaminergic neurotransmission coincides with sensitivity to substance abuse in a sample displaying binge-purge eating-disorder variants.

Gain-of-function missense variant in SLC12A2, encoding the bumetanide-sensitive NKCC1 cotransporter, identified in human schizophrenia	JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRIC RESEARCH			English	Article						Schizophrenia; GABA; NKCC1; Genetics; Cation-chloride cotransporters; Neuronal ionic homeostasis	PREFRONTAL CORTEX; SPAK/OSR1 KINASES; CORPUS-CALLOSUM; GENE-EXPRESSION; MESSENGER-RNA; MUTATIONS; KCC2; NEURONS; TRANSPORTERS; MODULATION	Perturbations of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurotransmission in the human prefrontal cortex have been implicated in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia (SCZ), but the mechanisms are unclear. NKCC1 (SLC12A2) is a Cl--importing cation-Cl- cotransporter that contributes to the maintenance of depolarizing GABA activity in immature neurons, and variation in SLC12A2 has been shown to increase the risk for schizophrenia via alterations of NKCC1 mRNA expression. However, no disease-causing mutations or functional variants in NKCC1 have been identified in human patients with SCZ. Here, by sequencing three large French-Canadian (FC) patient cohorts of SCZ, autism spectrum disorders (ASD), and intellectual disability (ID), we identified a novel heterozygous NKCC1 missense variant (p.Y199C) in SCZ. This variant is located in an evolutionarily conserved residue in the critical N-terminal regulatory domain and exhibits high predicted pathogenicity. No NKCC1 variants were detected in ASD or ID, and no KCC3 variants were identified in any of the three neurodevelopmental disorder cohorts. Functional experiments show Y199C is a gain-of-function variant, increasing Cl--dependent and bumetanide-sensitive NKCC1 activity even in conditions in which the transporter is normally functionally silent (hypotonicity). These data are the first to describe a functional missense variant in SLC12A2 in human SCZ, and suggest that genetically encoded dysregulation of NKCC1 may be a risk factor for, or contribute to the pathogenesis of, human SCZ.

Little is known about the profile and reasons for such visits. The aim of this study is (1) to describe the profile of elderly cancer patients aged 70 years and older who visited the ER of a regional hospital in Qu,bec, Canada, and (2) to explain the medical reasons and factors determining such visits from the patients' perspective. Methods A concurrent mixed method design was used. Descriptive analysis of administrative databases was conducted to describe the socio-demographic, clinical, and service utilization profile of 792 cancer patients aged 70 years and older. Content analysis of 11 semi-structured interviews of a sub-sample was subsequently performed to better understand the experience and meaning these patients attribute to this health behaviour. Results The sample of 792 older cancer patients made a total of 1572 ER visits. Most visits occurred during the daytime. More than half (53 %) of the patients were discharged, and close to 40 % were hospitalized. The most frequent reasons for consulting were respiratory (15.8 %), digestive (13.4 %), neurological (8.3 %), fever or infection-related (8.3 %), and cardiovascular (8.2 %). Content analysis of the qualitative data suggested that patients made ER visits mostly when other cancer care services were unavailable or because of a serious life-threatening health condition. Conclusions The study suggests areas of improvement to prevent ER visits when health issues can be addressed by other care services.

A complete understanding of the molecular signals implicated in cell surface interaction to initiate myelination/remyelination is currently lacking. The objective of our study was to assess whether Cdon, a cell surface protein that was shown to participate in muscle and neuron cell development, is involved in oligodendrocyte (OLG) differentiation and myelination. Here, we demonstrate that endogenous Cdon protein is expressed in OLPs, increasing in the early differentiation stages and decreasing in mature OLGs. Immunocytochemistry of endogenous Cdon showed localization on both OLG cell membranes and cellular processes exhibiting puncta- or varicosity-like structures. Cdon knockdown with siRNA decreased protein levels by 62% as well as two myelin-specific proteins, MBP and MAG. Conversely, overexpression of full-length rat Cdon increased myelin proteins in OLGs. The complexity of OLGs branching and contact point numbers with axons were also increased in Cdon overexpressing cells growing alone or in coculture with dorsal root ganglion neurons (DRGNs). Furthermore, myelination of DRGNs was decreased when OLPs were transfected with Cdon siRNA. Altogether, our results suggest that Cdon participates in OLG differentiation and myelination, most likely in the initial stages of development.

Methods: Twenty children with GDD (aged 4.1-12.1 years) and 11 age-matched controls with TD participated. Participants with GDD underwent 2 sessions of testing. Each session consisted of the Clinical Test of Sensory Interaction and Balance (CTSIB), Dynamic Visual Acuity (DVA) test, and the modified Emory Clinical Vestibular Chair Test (m-ECVCT). Results: Up to 33% of the children with GDD had abnormal DVA scores. m-ECVCT results of children with GDD demonstrated larger variance than children with TD. The CTSIB score was significantly reduced in the group with GDD. The test-retest reliability varied, with good reliability for the m-ECVCT and CTSIB, and fair reliability for the DVA. Conclusions: Findings suggest vestibular involvement in children in GDD. The clinical tests demonstrated moderate test-retest reliability.

For example, the ability to detect an error in one's own speech, halt speech production, and finally correct the error can be explained by assuming an inner speech loop which continuously compares the word representations induced by production to those induced by perception at various cognitive levels (e.g., conceptual, word, or phonological levels). Because spontaneous speech errors are relatively rare, a picture naming and halt paradigm can be used to evoke them. In this paradigm, picture presentation (target word initiation) is followed by an auditory stop signal (distractor word) for halting speech production. The current study seeks to understand the neural mechanisms governing self-detection of speech errors by developing a biologically inspired neural model of the inner speech loop. The neural model is based on the Neural Engineering Framework (NEE) and consists of a network of about 500,000 spiking neurons. In the first experiment we induce simulated speech errors semantically and phonologically. In the second experiment, we simulate a picture naming and halt task. Target-distractor word pairs were balanced with respect to variation of phonological and semantic similarity. The results of the first experiment show that speech errors are successfully detected by a monitoring component in the inner speech loop. The results of the second experiment show that the model correctly reproduces human behavioral data on the picture naming and halt task. In particular, the halting rate in the production of target words was lower for phonologically similar words than for semantically similar or fully dissimilar distractor words. We thus conclude that the neural architecture proposed here to model the inner speech loop reflects important interactions in production and perception at phonological and semantic levels.

We show that susceptibility to EAE requires activation of IL-1R1 on radiation-resistant cells via IL-1 beta secreted by bone marrow-derived cells. Neutrophils and monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) are the main source of IL-1 beta and produce this cytokine as a result of their transmigration across the inflamed blood-spinal cord barrier. IL-1R1 expression in the spinal cord is found in endothelial cells (ECs) of the pial venous plexus. Accordingly, leukocyte infiltration at EAE onset is restricted to IL-1R1(+) subpial and subarachnoid vessels. In response to IL-1 beta, primary cultures of central nervous system ECs produce GM-CSF, G-CSF, IL-6, Cxcl1, and Cxcl2. Initiation of EAE or subdural injection of IL-1 beta induces a similar cytokine/chemokine signature in spinal cord vessels. Furthermore, the transfer of Gr1(+) cells on the spinal cord is sufficient to induce illness in EAE-resistant IL-1 beta knockout (KO) mice. Notably, transfer of Gr1(+) cells isolated from C57BL/6 mice induce massive recruitment of recipient myeloid cells compared with cells from IL-1 beta KO donors, and this recruitment translates into more severe paralysis. These findings suggest that an IL-1 beta-dependent paracrine loop between infiltrated neutrophils/MDMs and ECs drives neuroinflammation.

Estrogen receptor alpha and G-protein coupled estrogen receptor 1 are localized to GABAergic neurons in the dorsal striatum	NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS			English	Article						GPR30; Membrane estrogen receptor alpha; gamma-Aminobutyric acid; Electron microscopy	RAT STRIATUM; DOPAMINE RELEASE; INDUCED INCREASE; FEMALE RATS; GABA; MICRODIALYSIS; ESTRADIOL; HIPPOCAMPUS; TERMINALS; GLIA	Estrogens affect dopamine transmission in the striatum, increasing dopamine availability, maintaining D2 receptor density, and reducing the availability of the dopamine transporter. Some of these effects of estrogens are rapid, suggesting that they are mediated by membrane associated receptors. Recently our group demonstrated that there is extra-nuclear labeling for ER alpha, ER beta, and GPER1 in the striatum, but that ER alpha and GPER1 are not localized to dopaminergic neurons in this region. GABAergic neurons are the most common type of neuron in the striatum, and changes in GABA transmission affect dopamine transmission. Thus, to determine whether ER alpha or GPER1 are localized to GABAergic neurons, we double labeled the striatum with antibodies for ER alpha or GPER1 and GABA and examined them using electron microscopy. Ultrastructural analysis revealed that ER alpha and GPER1 are localized exclusively to extranuclear sites in the striatum, and 35% of the dendrites and axon terminals labeled for these receptors contain GABA immunoreactivity. Binding at membrane-associated ER alpha and GPER1 could account for rapid estrogen-induced decreases in GABA transmission in the striatum, which, in turn, could affect dopamine transmission in this region.

Compounds were derived from the promiscuous kinase inhibitor PP1 to search for analogs that could potentially target a broad spectrum of kinases involved in cancer. Phenotypic screening against MCF7 mammary adenocarcinoma cells generated target agnostic structure activity relationships that biased subsequent designs toward breast cancer treatment rather than to a particular target. This strategy led to the discovery of two potent antiproliferative leads with phenotypically distinct anticancer mode of actions. Kinase profiling and further optimization resulted in eCF506, the first small molecule with subnanomolar IC50 for SRC that requires 3 orders of magnitude greater concentration to inhibit ABL. eCF506 exhibits excellent water solubility, an optimal-DMPK profile and oral bioavailability, halts SRC-associated neuromast migration in zebrafish embryos without inducing life-threatening heart defects, and inhibits SRC phosphorylation in tumor xenografts in mice.

ASTROCYTIC mGluR5 AND THE TRIPARTITE SYNAPSE	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Review						astrocyte; mGluR5s; synaptic transmission; tripartite synapse	METABOTROPIC GLUTAMATE RECEPTORS; IN-SITU RESPOND; HIPPOCAMPAL ASTROCYTES; RAT HIPPOCAMPUS; YOUNG-RATS; CA2+; BRAIN; CELLS; ACTIVATION; MATURATION	In the brain, astrocytes occupy a key position between vessels and synapses. Among their numerous functions, these glial cells are key partners of neurons during synaptic transmission. Astrocytes detect transmitter release through receptors and transporters at the level of their processes, which are in close proximity to the tow neuronal elements of synapses. In response to transmitter-mediated activation, glial cells in turn regulate synaptic transmission and neuronal excitability. This process has been reported to involve several glial receptors. One of the best known of such receptors is the metabotropic glutamatergic receptor subtype 5 (mGluR5). In the present review we will discuss the implication of mGluR5s as detectors of synaptic transmission. In particular, we will discuss how the functional properties and localization of these receptors permit the detection of the synaptic signal in a defined temporal window and a given spatial area around the synapse. Furthermore, we will review the impact of their activation on synaptic transmission. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Astrocyte-Neuron Interact. (C) 2015 IBRO.

Recent discoveries have revealed that astrocytes perform very specialized and heterogeneous roles in brain homeostasis and function. Exactly how astrocytes fulfill such diverse roles in the brain remains to be fully understood and is an active area of research. In this review, we focus on the complex subcellular anatomical features of protoplasmic gray matter astrocytes in the mature, healthy brain that likely empower these cells with the ability to detect and respond to changes in neuronal and synaptic activity. In particular, we discuss how intricate processes on astrocytes allow these cells to communicate with neurons and their synapses and strategically deliver specific cellular organelles such as mitochondria and ribosomes to active compartments within the neuropil. Understanding the properties of these structural elements will lead to a better understanding of how astrocytes function in the healthy and diseased brain.

NOVA2-mediated RNA regulation is required for axonal pathfinding during development	ELIFE			English	Article							PRODUCT OTOACOUSTIC EMISSIONS; COCHLEAR HAIR-CELLS; BINDING PROTEIN; NERVOUS-SYSTEM; NOVA; MICE; GUIDANCE; BRAIN; INNERVATION; NETRIN-1	The neuron specific RNA-binding proteins NOVA1 and NOVA2 are highly homologous alternative splicing regulators. NOVA proteins regulate at least 700 alternative splicing events in vivo, yet relatively little is known about the biologic consequences of NOVA action and in particular about functional differences between NOVA1 and NOVA2. Transcriptome-wide searches for isoform-specific functions, using NOVA1 and NOVA2 specific HITS-CLIP and RNA-seq data from mouse cortex lacking either NOVA isoform, reveals that NOVA2 uniquely regulates alternative splicing events of a series of axon guidance related genes during cortical development. Corresponding axonal pathfinding defects were specific to NOVA2 deficiency: Nova2-/- but not Nova1-/- mice had agenesis of the corpus callosum, and axonal outgrowth defects specific to ventral motoneuron axons and efferent innervation of the cochlea. Thus we have discovered that NOVA2 uniquely regulates alternative splicing of a coordinate set of transcripts encoding key components in cortical, brainstem and spinal axon guidance/outgrowth pathways during neural differentiation, with severe functional consequences in vivo.

Ocular hypertension is the most significant known risk factor for developing the disease, but the mechanism by which elevated pressure damages RGCs is currently unknown. The axonal-enriched microtubule-associated protein tau is a key mediator of neurotoxicity in Alzheimer's disease and other tauopathies. Using a well characterized in vivo rat glaucoma model, we show an age-related increase in endogenous retinal tau that was markedly exacerbated by ocular hypertension. Early alterations in tau phosphorylation, characterized by epitope-dependent hyperphosphorylation and hypophosphorylation, correlated with the appearance of tau oligomers in glaucomatous retinas. Our data demonstrate the mislocalization of tau in the somatodendritic compartment of RGCs subjected to high intraocular pressure. In contrast, tau was depleted from RGC axons in the optic nerve of glaucomatous eyes. Importantly, intraocular administration of short interferingRNAagainst tau effectively reduced retinal tau accumulation and promoted robust survival of RGC somas and axons, supporting a critical role for tau alterations in ocular hypertension-induced neuronal damage. Our study reveals that glaucoma displays signature pathological features of tauopathies, including tau accumulation, altered phosphorylation, and missorting; and identifies tau as a novel target to counter RGC neurodegeneration in glaucoma and prevalent optic neuropathies.

Some endogenous and exogenous molecules can modulate these processes. Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), an omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid, has mainly been considered as a modulator of plasma membrane fluidity in brain development and aging, while DHA's role in organelle remodeling in specific neural cell types at the ultrastructural level remains largely unexplored. DHA is notably incorporated into dynamic organelles named lipid bodies (LBs). We hypothesized that DHA could attenuate the inflammatory response in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated microglia by remodeling LBs and altering their functional interplay with mitochondria and other associated organelles. Results: We used electron microscopy to analyze at high spatial resolution organelle changes in N9 microglial cells exposed to the proinflammogen LPS, with or without DHA supplementation. Our results revealed that DHA reverses several effects of LPS in organelles. In particular, a large number of very small and grouped LBs was exclusively found in microglial cells exposed to DHA. In contrast, LBs in LPS-stimulated cells in the absence of DHA were sparse and large. LBs formed in the presence of DHA were generally electron-dense, suggesting DHA incorporation into these organelles. The accumulation of LBs in microglial cells from mouse and human was confirmed in situ. In addition, DHA induced numerous contacts between LBs and mitochondria and reversed the frequent disruption of mitochondrial integrity observed upon LPS stimulation. Dilation of the endoplasmic reticulum lumen was also infrequent following DHA treatment, suggesting that DHA reduces oxidative stress and protein misfolding. Lipidomic analysis in N9 microglial cells treated with DHA revealed an increase in phosphatidylserine, indicating the role of this phospholipid in normalization and maintenance of physiological membrane functions. This finding was supported by a marked reduction of microglial filopodia and endosome number and significant reduction of LPS-induced phagocytosis. Conclusions: DHA attenuates the inflammatory response in LPS-stimulated microglial cells by remodeling LBs and altering their interplay with mitochondria and other associated organelles. Our findings point towards a mechanism by which omega-3 DHA participates in organelle reorganization and contributes to the maintenance of neural cell homeostasis.

By changing one simple element of the polytope (position of one vertex or length of an edge), one can retain the exact symmetry of the polytope by simultaneously changing other corresponding elements of the polytope. A simple method of using the symmetry of polytopes in order to determine several resonant frequencies is presented. Knowledge of these frequencies, or at least their ratios can be used for control of some principal changes of the polytopes.

CTSN	Two-Year Outcomes of Surgical Treatment of Moderate Ischemic Mitral Regurgitation	NEW ENGLAND JOURNAL OF MEDICINE			English	Article							LEFT-VENTRICULAR DYSFUNCTION; CHRONIC HEART-FAILURE; MYOCARDIAL-INFARCTION; PROGNOSTIC VALUE; BYPASS SURGERY; SURVIVAL; REVASCULARIZATION; TRIAL; ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY; VIABILITY	BACKGROUND In a trial comparing coronary-artery bypass grafting (CABG) alone with CABG plus mitral-valve repair in patients with moderate ischemic mitral regurgitation, we found no significant difference in the left ventricular end-systolic volume index (LVESVI) or survival after 1 year. Concomitant mitral-valve repair was associated with a reduced prevalence of moderate or severe mitral regurgitation, but patients had more adverse events. We now report 2-year outcomes. METHODS We randomly assigned 301 patients to undergo either CABG alone or the combined procedure. Patients were followed for 2 years for clinical and echocardiographic outcomes. RESULTS At 2 years, the mean (+/- SD) LVESVI was 41.2 +/- 20.0 ml per square meter of body-surface area in the CABG-alone group and 43.2 +/- 20.6 ml per square meter in the combined-procedure group (mean improvement over baseline, -14.1 ml per square meter and -14.6 ml per square meter, respectively). The rate of death was 10.6% in the CABG-alone group and 10.0% in the combined-procedure group (hazard ratio in the combined-procedure group, 0.90; 95% confidence interval, 0.45 to 1.83; P = 0.78). There was no significant between-group difference in the rank-based assessment of the LVESVI (including death) at 2 years (z score, 0.38; P = 0.71). The 2-year rate of moderate or severe residual mitral regurgitation was higher in the CABG-alone group than in the combined-procedure group (32.3% vs. 11.2%, P< 0.001). Overall rates of hospital readmission and serious adverse events were similar in the two groups, but neurologic events and supraventricular arrhythmias remained more frequent in the combined-procedure group. CONCLUSIONS In patients with moderate ischemic mitral regurgitation undergoing CABG, the addition of mitral-valve repair did not lead to significant differences in left ventricular reverse remodeling at 2 years. Mitral-valve repair provided a more durable correction of mitral regurgitation but did not significantly improve survival or reduce overall adverse events or readmissions and was associated with an early hazard of increased neurologic events and supraventricular arrhythmias.

Furthermore, passivity-based approach is used to derive the robust property of the proposed multi-time scales neural networks observer. Compared with the other nonlinear observers without considering the time scales, the proposed observer demonstrates faster convergence and more accurate properties. Two examples are presented confirming the validity of the above approach. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Identifying Neurocognitive Decline at 36 Months among HIV-Positive Participants in the CHARTER Cohort Using Group-Based Trajectory Analysis	PLOS ONE			English	Article							ANTIRETROVIRAL THERAPY; NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL IMPAIRMENT; DEVELOPMENTAL TRAJECTORIES; ERA; INFECTION; DISORDERS; INDIVIDUALS; PREVALENCE; DEMENTIA; RISK	Introduction While HIV-associated neurocognitive impairment remains common despite the widespread use of combined antiretroviral therapy (cART), there have been relatively few studies investigating the trajectories of neurocognitive change in longitudinal NeuroAIDS studies. Objective To estimate the magnitude and pattern of neurocognitive change over the first 3 years of follow-up using Group-Based Trajectory Analysis (GBTA) applied to participants in the longitudinal arm of the CHARTER cohort. Method The study population consisted of 701 CHARTER participants who underwent neuropsychological (NP) testing on at least 2 occasions. Raw test scores on 15 NP measures were modeled using GBTA. Each trajectory was categorized as stable, improved or declined, according to two different criteria for change (whether the magnitude of the estimated change at 36 months differed >= 0.5 standard deviations from baseline value or changed by > the standard error of measurement estimated at times 1 and 2). Individuals who declined on one or more NP measures were categorized as decliners. Results Overall, 111 individuals (15.8%) declined on at least one NP test over 36 months, with the vast majority showing decline on a single NP test (93/111-83.8%). The posterior probability of group assignment was high in most participants (71%) after only 2 sessions, and in the overwhelming majority of those with 3+ sessions. Heterogeneity of trajectories was the norm rather than the exception. Individuals who declined had, on average, worse baseline NP performance on every test, were older, had a longer duration of HIV infection and more follow-up sessions. Conclusion The present study identified heterogeneous trajectories over 3 years across 15 NP raw test scores using GBTA. Cognitive decline was observed in only a small subset of this study cohort. Decliners had demographics and HIV characteristics that have been previously associated with cognitive decline, suggesting clinical validity for the method.

A component somewhat reminiscent of the CPS in language has also been reported for musical phrases (i.e., the so-called 'music CPS'). However, in previous studies the quantification of the music-CPS as well as its morphology and timing differed substantially from the characteristics of the language-CPS. Therefore, the degree of correspondence between cognitive mechanisms of phrasing in music and in language has remained questionable. Here, we probed the shared nature of mechanisms underlying musical and prosodic phrasing by (1) investigating whether the music-CPS is present at phrase boundary positions where the language-CPS has been originally reported (i.e., at the onset of the pause between phrases), and (2) comparing the CPS in music and in language in non-musicians and professional musicians. For the first time, we report a positive shift at the onset of musical phrase boundaries that strongly resembles the language-CPS and argue that the postboundary 'music-CPS' of previous studies may be an entirely distinct ERP component. Moreover, the language-CPS in musicians was found to be less prominent than in non-musicians, suggesting more efficient processing of prosodic phrases in language as a result of higher musical expertise.

Cognitive Aging and Time Perception: Roles of Bayesian Optimization and Degeneracy	FRONTIERS IN AGING NEUROSCIENCE			English	Review						interval timing; attention; clock; memory; decision-making; striatal beat-frequency model	PRENATAL-CHOLINE SUPPLEMENTATION; AGE-RELATED-CHANGES; SOMATOSENSORY TEMPORAL DISCRIMINATION; DOPAMINE-GLUTAMATE INTERACTIONS; DEPENDENT MEMORY CONSOLIDATION; INTERNAL CLOCK; WORKING-MEMORY; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; SUBJECTIVE TIME; OLDER-ADULTS	This review outlines the basic psychological and neurobiological processes associated with age-related distortions in timing and time perception in the hundredths of milliseconds-to-minutes range. The difficulty in separating indirect effects of impairments in attention and memory from direct effects on timing mechanisms is addressed. The main premise is that normal aging is commonly associated with increased noise and temporal uncertainty as a result of impairments in attention and memory as well as the possible reduction in the accuracy and precision of a central timing mechanism supported by dopamine-glutamate interactions in cortico-striatal circuits. Pertinent to these findings, potential interventions that may reduce the likelihood of observing age related declines in timing are discussed. Bayesian optimization models are able to account for the adaptive changes observed in time perception by assuming that older adults are more likely to base their temporal judgments on statistical inferences derived from multiple trials than on a single trial's clock reading, which is more susceptible to distortion. We propose that the timing functions assigned to the age-sensitive fronto-striatal network can be subserved by other neural networks typically associated with finely-tuned perceptuo-motor adjustments, through degeneracy principles (different structures serving a common function).

Brain in Congenital Heart Disease Across the Lifespan: The Cumulative Burden of Injury	CIRCULATION			English	Review						congenital abnormalities; heart diseases	QUALITY-OF-LIFE; VASCULAR RISK-FACTORS; CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; CIRCULATORY ARREST; EXECUTIVE FUNCTION; ALZHEIMER-DISEASE; CARDIAC-SURGERY; D-TRANSPOSITION; GREAT-ARTERIES; YOUNG-ADULTS	The number of patients surviving with congenital heart disease (CHD) has soared over the last 3 decades. Adults constitute the fastest-growing segment of the CHD population, now outnumbering children. Research to date on the heart-brain intersection in this population has been focused largely on neurodevelopmental outcomes in childhood and adolescence. Mutations in genes that are highly expressed in heart and brain may cause cerebral dysgenesis. Together with altered cerebral perfusion in utero, these factors are associated with abnormalities of brain structure and brain immaturity in a significant portion of neonates with critical CHD even before they undergo cardiac surgery. In infancy and childhood, the brain may be affected by risk factors related to heart disease itself or to its interventional treatments. As children with CHD become adults, they increasingly develop heart failure, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and coronary disease. These acquired cardiovascular comorbidities can be expected to have effects similar to those in the general population on cerebral blood flow, brain volumes, and dementia. In both children and adults, cardiovascular disease may have adverse effects on achievement, executive function, memory, language, social interactions, and quality of life. Against the backdrop of shifting demographics, risk factors for brain injury in the CHD population are cumulative and synergistic. As neurodevelopmental sequelae in children with CHD evolve to cognitive decline or dementia during adulthood, a growing population of CHD can be expected to require support services. We highlight evidence gaps and future research directions.

Speech motor learning changes the neural response to both auditory and somatosensory signals	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							SENSORIMOTOR ADAPTATION; FUNCTIONAL-SIGNIFICANCE; PLASTICITY; RECALIBRATION; COMPENSATION; PERCEPTION; FEEDBACK; VOWELS; CORTEX; BRAIN	In the present paper, we present evidence for the idea that speech motor learning is accompanied by changes to the neural coding of both auditory and somatosensory stimuli. Participants in our experiments undergo adaptation to altered auditory feedback, an experimental model of speech motor learning which like visuo-motor adaptation in limb movement, requires that participants change their speech movements and associated somatosensory inputs to correct for systematic real-time changes to auditory feedback. We measure the sensory effects of adaptation by examining changes to auditory and somatosensory event-related responses. We find that adaptation results in progressive changes to speech acoustical outputs that serve to correct for the perturbation. We also observe changes in both auditory and somatosensory event-related responses that are correlated with the magnitude of adaptation. These results indicate that sensory change occurs in conjunction with the processes involved in speech motor adaptation.

Neuroanatomic Differences Associated With Stress Susceptibility and Resilience	BIOLOGICAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						Chronic stress; Cingulate cortex; Depression; DTI; Hippocampus; MRI; Neural circuits; Ventral tegmental area	HIPPOCAMPAL VOLUME CHANGES; CA3 PYRAMIDAL NEURONS; SOCIAL DEFEAT STRESS; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; MAJOR DEPRESSION; BED NUCLEUS; FRACTIONAL ANISOTROPY; PERIAQUEDUCTAL GRAY; BRAIN STRUCTURE; NERVOUS-SYSTEM	BACKGROUND: We examined the neurobiological mechanisms underlying stress susceptibility using structural magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion tensor imaging to determine neuroanatomic differences between stress-susceptible and resilient mice. We also examined synchronized anatomic differences between brain regions to gain insight into the plasticity of neural networks underlying stress susceptibility. METHODS: C57BL/6 mice underwent 10 days of social defeat stress and were subsequently tested for social avoidance. For magnetic resonance imaging, brains of stressed (susceptible, n = 11; resilient, n = 8) and control (n = 12) mice were imaged ex vivo at 56 mu m resolution using a T2-weighted sequence. We tested for behavior-structure correlations by regressing social avoidance z-scores against local brain volume. For diffusion tensor imaging, brains were scanned with a diffusion-weighted fast spin echo sequence at 78 mu m isotropic voxels. Structural covariance was assessed by correlating local volume between brain regions. RESULTS: Social avoidance correlated negatively with local volume of the cingulate cortex, nucleus accumbens, thalamus, raphe nuclei, and bed nucleus of the stria terminals. Social avoidance correlated positively with volume of the ventral tegmental area (VTA), habenula, periaqueductal gray, cerebellum, hypothalamus, and hippocampal CA3. Fractional anisotropy was increased in the hypothalamus and hippocampal CA3. We observed synchronized anatomic differences between the VTA and cingulate cortex, hippocampus and VTA, hippocampus and cingulate cortex, and hippocampus and hypothalamus. These correlations revealed different structural covariance between brain regions in susceptible and resilient mice. CONCLUSIONS: Stress-integrative brain regions shape the neural architecture underlying individual differences in susceptibility and resilience to chronic stress.

The canonical view is that Rabs are soluble in their inactive GDP-bound form, and only upon activation and conversion to their GTP-bound state are they anchored to membranes through membrane insertion of a C-terminal prenyl group. Here we demonstrate that C-terminal prenylation is not required for Rab13 to associate with and traffic on vesicles. Instead, inactive Rab13 appears to associate with vesicles via protein-protein interactions. Only following activation does Rab13 associate with the plasma membrane, presumably with insertion of the C-terminal prenyl group into the membrane.

Spontaneous physiological variability modulates dynamic functional connectivity in resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging	PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY A-MATHEMATICAL PHYSICAL AND ENGINEERING SCIENCES			English	Article						blood oxygen level-dependent signal; end-tidal CO2; heart rate variability; wavelets	HEART-RATE-VARIABILITY; HUMAN BRAIN; FMRI; NETWORKS; FLUCTUATIONS; HUMANS; SIGNAL	It is well known that the blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is influenced in addition to neuronal activity-by fluctuations in physiological signals, including arterial CO2, respiration and heart rate/heart rate variability (HR/HRV). Even spontaneous fluctuations of the aforementioned physiological signals have been shown to influence the BOLD fMRI signal in a regionally specific manner. Related to this, estimates of functional connectivity between different brain regions, performed when the subject is at rest, may be confounded by the effects of physiological signal fluctuations. Moreover, resting functional connectivity has been shown to vary with respect to time (dynamic functional connectivity), with the sources of this variation not fully elucidated. In this context, we examine the relation between dynamic functional connectivity patterns and the time-varying properties of simultaneously recorded physiological signals (end-tidal CO2 and HR/HRV) using resting-state fMRI measurements from 12 healthy subjects. The results reveal a modulatory effect of the aforementioned physiological signals on the dynamic resting functional connectivity patterns for a number of resting-state networks (default mode network, somatosensory, visual). By using discrete wavelet decomposition, we also show that these modulation effects are more pronounced in specific frequency bands.	[Nikolaou, F.; Orphanidou, C.; Mitsis, G.

However, establishing direct causality between neural activity during REMS and memory consolidation has proven difficult because of the transient nature of REMS and significant caveats associated with REMS deprivation techniques. In mice, we optogenetically silenced medial septum gamma-aminobutyric acid-releasing (MSGABA) neurons, allowing for temporally precise attenuation of the memory-associated theta rhythm during REMS without disturbing sleeping behavior. REMS-specific optogenetic silencing of MSGABA neurons selectively during a REMS critical window after learning erased subsequent novel object place recognition and impaired fear-conditioned contextual memory. Silencing MSGABA neurons for similar durations outside REMS episodes had no effect on memory. These results demonstrate that MSGABA neuronal activity specifically during REMS is required for normal memory consolidation.

Neural Activity-Dependent Regulation of Radial Glial Filopodial Motility Is Mediated by Glial cGMP-Dependent Protein Kinase 1 and Contributes to Synapse Maturation in the Developing Visual System	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						astrocyte; neuron-glia interaction; NMDA receptor; radial glia; retinotectal; synaptogenesis; PKG	IN-VIVO; STRUCTURAL PLASTICITY; GLUTAMATE TRANSPORT; BRAIN-DEVELOPMENT; ASTROCYTES; DYNAMICS; SERINE; ROLES; CELLS; NEUROTRANSMISSION	Radial glia in the developing optic tectum extend highly dynamic filopodial protrusions within the tectal neuropil, the motility of which has previously been shown to be sensitive to neural activity and nitric oxide (NO) release. Using in vivo two-photon microscopy, we performed time-lapse imaging of radial glial cells and measured filopodial motility in the intact albino Xenopus laevis tadpole. Application of MK801 to block neuronal NMDA receptor (NMDAR) currents confirmed a significant reduction in radial glial filopodial motility. This reduction did not occur in glial cells expressing a dominant-negative form of cGMP-dependent protein kinase 1 (PKG1), and was prevented by elevation of cGMP levels with the phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor sildenafil. These results suggest that neuronal NMDAR activation results in the release of NO, which in turn modulates PKG1 activation in glial cells to control filopodial motility. We further showed that interfering with the function of the small GTPases Rac1 or RhoA, known to be regulated by PKG1 phosphorylation, decreased motility or eliminated filopodial processes respectively. These manipulations led to profound defects in excitatory synaptic development and maturation of neighboring neurons.

Orientation tuning of binocular summation: a comparison of colour to achromatic contrast	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							PSYCHOPHYSICAL EVIDENCE; PROBABILITY SUMMATION; CHROMATIC CONTRAST; MACAQUE V1; VISION; THRESHOLD; MASKING; NEURONS; SUPPRESSION; STIMULI	A key function of the primary visual cortex is to combine the input from the two eyes into a unified binocular percept. At low, near threshold, contrasts a process of summation occurs if the visual inputs from the two eyes are similar. Here we measure the orientation tuning of binocular summation for chromatic and equivalent achromatic contrast. We derive estimates of orientation tuning by measuring binocular summation as a function of the orientation difference between two sinusoidal gratings presented dichoptically to different eyes. We then use a model to estimate the orientation bandwidth of the neural detectors underlying the binocular combination. We find that orientation bandwidths are similar for chromatic and achromatic stimuli at both low (0.375 c/deg) and mid (1.5 c/deg) spatial frequencies, with an overall average of 29 +/- 3 degs (HWHH, s.e.m). This effect occurs despite the overall greater binocular summation found for the low spatial frequency chromatic stimuli. These results suggest that similar, oriented processes underlie both chromatic and achromatic binocular contrast combination. The non-oriented detection process found in colour vision at low spatial frequencies under monocular viewing is not evident at the binocular combination stage.

Decreased neuroinflammation correlates to higher vagus nerve activity fluctuations in near-term ovine fetuses: a case for the afferent cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway?	JOURNAL OF NEUROINFLAMMATION			English	Article						Fetus; Labor; Vagus; Microglia; HMGB1; CHRNA7; HRV; RMSSD	HEART-RATE-VARIABILITY; UMBILICAL-CORD OCCLUSION; SYSTEMIC INFLAMMATORY RESPONSE; ALPHA-7 NICOTINIC RECEPTORS; MICROGLIAL ACTIVATION; FETAL SHEEP; BRAIN; PRETERM; BIRTH; STIMULATION	Background: Neuroinflammation in utero may contribute to brain injury resulting in life-long neurological disabilities. The pivotal role of the efferent cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway (CAP) in controlling inflammation, e.g., by inhibiting the HMGB1 release, via the macrophages' alpha 7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (alpha 7nAChR) has been described in adults, but its importance in the fetus is unknown. Moreover, it is unknown whether CAP may also exert anti-inflammatory effects on the brain via the anatomically predominant afferent component of the vagus nerve. Methods: We measured microglial activation in the ovine fetal brain near term 24 h after the umbilical cord occlusions mimicking human labor versus controls (no occlusions) by quantifying HMGB1 nucleus-to-cytosol translocation in the Iba1+ and alpha 7nAChR+ microglia. Based on multiple clinical studies in adults and our own work in fetal autonomic nervous system, we gauged the degree of CAP activity in vivo using heart rate variability measure RMSSD that reflects fluctuations in vagus nerve activity. Results: RMSSD correlated to corresponding plasma IL-1 beta levels at R = 0.57 (p = 0.02, n = 17) and to white matter microglia cell counts at R = -0.89 (p = 0.03). The insult increased the HMGB1 translocation in alpha 7nAChR+ microglia in a brain region-dependent manner (p < 0.001). In parallel, RMSSD at 1 h post insult correlated with cytosolic HMGB1 of thalamic microglia (R = -0.94, p = 0.005), and RMSSD at pH nadir correlated with microglial alpha 7nAChR in the white matter (R = 0.83, p = 0.04). Overall, higher RMSSD values correlated with lower HMGB1 translocation and higher alpha 7nAChR intensity per area in a brain region-specific manner. Conclusions: Afferent fetal CAP may translate increased vagal cholinergic signaling into suppression of cerebral inflammation in response to near-term hypoxic acidemia as might occur during labor. Our findings suggest a new control mechanism of fetal neuroinflammation via the vagus nerve, providing novel possibilities for its non-invasive monitoring in utero and for targeted treatment.

Adult NG2-Glia Are Required for Median Eminence-Mediated Leptin Sensing and Body Weight Control	CELL METABOLISM			English	Article							ARCUATE NUCLEUS; POMC NEURONS; OBESE GENE; DB/DB MICE; OB/OB MICE; BRAIN; RECEPTOR; DIET; HYPOTHALAMUS; RESISTANCE	While leptin is a well-known regulator of body fat mass, it remains unclear how circulating leptin is sensed centrally to maintain energy homeostasis. Here we show that genetic and pharmacological ablation of adult NG2-glia (also known as oligodendrocyte precursors), but not microglia, leads to primary leptin resistance and obesity in mice. We reveal that NG2-glia contact the dendritic processes of arcuate nucleus leptin receptor (LepR) neurons in the median eminence (ME) and that these processes degenerate upon NG2-glia elimination, which explains the consequential attenuation of these neurons' molecular and electrical responses to leptin. Our data therefore indicate that LepR dendrites in the ME represent the principal conduits of leptin's anorexigenic action and that NG2-glia are essential for their maintenance. Given that ME-directed X-irradiation confirmed the pharmacological and genetically mediated ablation effects on body weight, our findings provide a rationale for the known obesity risk associated with cranial radiation therapy.

Fifty-two young healthy non-musicians were familiarized with the sound to key-press mapping on a computer keyboard and tested on their baseline motor performance. Each participant received subsequently either continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS) or sham stimulation over the dPMC and was then asked to remember a 12-note melody without moving. For half of the participants, the contour of the melody memorized was congruent to a subsequently performed, but never practiced, finger movement sequence (Congruent group). For the other half, the melody memorized was incongruent to the subsequent finger movement sequence (Incongruent group). Hearing a congruent melody led to significantly faster performance of a motor sequence immediately thereafter compared to hearing an incongruent melody. In addition, cTBS speeded up motor performance in both groups, possibly by relieving motor consolidation from interference by the declarative melody memorization task. Our findings substantiate recent evidence that exposure to a movement-related tone sequence can induce specific, crossmodal encoding of a movement sequence representation. They further suggest that cTBS over the dPMC may enhance early offline procedural motor skill consolidation in cognitive states where motor consolidation would normally be disturbed by concurrent declarative memory processes. These findings may contribute to a better understanding of auditory-motor system interactions and have implications for the development of new motor rehabilitation approaches using sound and non-invasive brain stimulation as neuromodulatory tools.

The Impact of a Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy on Event-Related Potentials in Patients with Tic Disorders or Body-Focused Repetitive Behaviors	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						Tourette syndrome; tic disorders; body-focused repetitive behaviors; habit disorder; cognitive behavioral therapy; cognitive psychophysiological therapy; event-related potentials; electrophysiology	LA-TOURETTE-SYNDROME; OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE DISORDER; SKIN PICKING DISORDER; VISUAL ODDBALL TASK; MATTER ABNORMALITIES; P300 ABNORMALITIES; BRAIN; TRICHOTILLOMANIA; ATTENTION; METAANALYSIS	Context: Tic disorders (TD) are characterized by the presence of non voluntary contractions of functionally related groups of skeletal muscles in one or multiple body parts. Patients with body-focused repetitive behaviors (BFRB) present frequent and repetitive behaviors, such as nail biting or hair pulling. TD and BFRB can be treated with a cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) that regulates the excessive amount of sensorimotor activation and muscular tension. Our CBT, which is called the cognitive psychophysiological (CoPs) model, targets motor execution and inhibition, and it was reported to modify brain activity in TD. However, psychophysiological effects of therapy are still poorly understood in TD and BFRB patients. Our goals were to compare the event -related potentials (ERP) of TD and BFRB patients to control participants and to investigate the effects of the CoPs therapy on the P200, N200, and P300 components during a motor and a non -motor oddball task. Method: Event -related potential components were compared in 26 TD patients, 27 BFRB patients, and 27 control participants. ERP were obtained from 63 EEG electrodes during two oddball tasks. In the non -motor task, participants had to count rare stimuli. In the motor task, participants had to respond with a left and right button press for rare and frequent stimuli, respectively. ERP measures were recorded before and after therapy in both patient groups. Results: CoPs therapy improved symptoms similarly in both clinical groups. Before therapy, TD and BFRB patients had reduced P300 oddball effect during the non -motor task, in comparison with controls participants. An increase in the P300 oddball effect was observed posttherapy. This increase was distributed over the whole cortex in BFRB patients, but localized in the parietal area in TD patients. Discussion: These results suggest a modification of neural processes following CoPs therapy in TD and BFRB patients.

With similar to 70 members in humans, Rabs have been implicated in all steps of membrane trafficking ranging from vesicle formation and transport to vesicle docking/tethering and fusion. Vesicle trafficking controls the localization and levels of a myriad of proteins, thus regulating cellular functions including proliferation, metabolism, cell-cell adhesion, and cell migration. It is therefore not surprising that impairment of Rab pathways is associated with diseases including cancer. In this review, we highlight evidence supporting the role of Rab13 as a potent driver of cancer progression.

Based on Molecular Profiling of Gene Expression, Palmoplantar Pustulosis and Palmoplantar Pustular Psoriasis Are Highly Related Diseases that Appear to Be Distinct from Psoriasis Vulgaris	PLOS ONE			English	Article							ASSOCIATION; SERUM	Introduction There is a controversy surrounding the existence of palmoplantar pustulosis (PPP) and palmoplantar pustular psoriasis (PPPP) as separate clinical entities or as variants of the same clinical entity. We used gene expression microarray to compare gene expression in PPP and PPPP. Methodology/Principal findings Skin biopsies from subjects with PPP (3), PPPP (6), psoriasis vulgaris (10) and acral skin from normal subjects (7) were analyzed using gene expression microarray. Principal component analysis showed that PPP and PPPP were different from psoriasis vulgaris and normal acral skin. However gene expression of PPP and PPPP clustered together and could not be used to differentiate PPP from PPPP. Gene-wise comparison between PPP and PPPP found no gene to be differentially expressed at a false discovery rate lower than 0.05. Surprisingly we found a higher expression of several genes involved in neural pathways (e.g. GPRIN and ADAM23) in PPP/PPPP as compared to psoriasis vulgaris and normal acral skin. Immunohistochemistry confirmed those findings and showed a keratinocyte localization for those proteins. Conclusion significance PPP and PPPP could not be differentiated using gene expression microarray suggesting that they are not distinct clinical entities. Increased expression of GPRIN1, and ADAM23 in keratinocytes suggests that these proteins could be new therapeutic targets for PPP/PPPP.

Although more than 70 genes and genetic loci have been implicated in HSP, many families remain genetically undiagnosed, suggesting that other genetic causes of HSP are still to be identified. HSP can be inherited in an autosomal-dominant, autosomal-recessive, or X-linked manner. In the current study, we performed whole-exome sequencing to analyze a total of nine affected individuals in three families with autosomal-recessive HSP. Rare homozygous and compound-heterozygous nonsense, missense, frameshift, and splice-site mutations in CAPN1 were identified in all affected individuals, and sequencing in additional family members confirmed the segregation of these mutations with the disease (spastic paraplegia 76 [SPG76]). CAPN1 encodes calpain 1, a protease that is widely present in the CNS. Calpain 1 is involved in synaptic plasticity, synaptic restructuring, and axon maturation and maintenance. Three models of calpain 1 deficiency were further studied. In Caenorhabditis elegans, loss of calpain 1 function resulted in neuronal and axonal dysfunction and degeneration. Similarly, loss-of-function of the Drosophila melanogaster ortholog calpain B caused locomotor defects and axonal anomalies. Knockdown of calpain 1a, a CAPN1 ortholog in Danio rerio, resulted in abnormal branchiomotor neuron migration and disorganized acetylated-tubulin axonal networks in the brain. The identification of mutations in CAPN1 in HSP expands our understanding of the disease causes and potential mechanisms.

Using affective brain-computer interfaces to characterize human influential factors for speech quality-of-experience perception modelling	HUMAN-CENTRIC COMPUTING AND INFORMATION SCIENCES			English	Article						Quality-of-experience; Affective computing; Brain computer interfaces; Text-to-speech; Electroencephalography	SELF-ASSESSMENT MANNEQUIN; SYNTHESIZED SPEECH; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; EMOTION; EEG; EXPRESSIONS	As new speech technologies emerge, telecommunication service providers have to provide superior user experience in order to remain competitive. To this end, quality-of-experience (QoE) perception modelling and measurement has become a key priority. QoE models rely on three influence factors: technological, contextual and human. Existing solutions have typically relied on the former two and human influence factors (HIFs) have been mostly neglected due to difficulty in measuring them. In this paper, we show that measuring human affective states is important for QoE measurement and propose the use of affective brain-computer interfaces (aBCIs) for objective measurement of perceived QoE for two emerging speech technologies, namely far-field hands-free communications and text-to-speech systems. When incorporating subjectively-derived HIFs into the QoE model, gains of up to 26.3 % could be found relative to utilizing only technological factors. When utilizing HIFs derived from an electroen-cephalography (EEG) based aBCI, in turn, gains of up to 14.5 % were observed. These findings show the importance of using aBCIs in QoE measurement and also highlight that further improvement may be warranted once improved affective state correlates are found from EEGs and/or other neurophysiological modalities.

When pain is controllable, the lateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) seems to inhibit pain processing, although it is unclear how this is achieved. Using fMRI in healthy volunteers, we examined brain activation during controllable and uncontrollable stimulation to answer these questions. In the controllable task, participants self-adjusted temperatures applied to their hand of pain or warm intensities to provoke a constant sensation. In the uncontrollable task, the temperature time courses of the controllable task were replayed (yoked control) and participants rated their sensation continuously. During controllable pain trials, participants significantly downregulated the temperature to keep their sensation constant. Despite receiving the identical nociceptive input, intensity ratings increased during the uncontrollable pain trials. This additional sensitization was mirrored in increased activation of pain-processing regions such as insula, anterior cingulate cortex, and thalamus. Further, increased connectivity between the anterior insula and medial PFC (mPFC) in the uncontrollable and increased negative connectivity between dorsolateral PFC (dlPFC) and insula in the controllable task were observed. This suggests a pain-facilitating role of the mPFC during uncontrollable pain and a pain-inhibiting role of the dlPFC during controllable pain, both exerting their respective effects via the anterior insula. These results elucidate neural mechanisms of context-dependent pain modulation and their relation to subjective perception.

Furthermore, glial cells in the NAc are activated by drugs of abuse, but the contribution of glia to the development of addictive behaviors is unknown. Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), an inflammatory cytokine released by activated glia, can drive the internalization of synaptic AMPA receptors on striatal medium spiny neurons. Here we show that repeated administration of cocaine activates striatal microglia and induces TNF-alpha production, which in turn depresses glutamatergic synaptic strength in the NAc core and limits the development of behavioral sensitization. Critically, following a period of abstinence, a weak TLR4 agonist can reactivate microglia, increase TNF-alpha production, depress striatal synaptic strength, and suppress cocaine-induced sensitization. Thus, cytokine signaling from microglia can regulate both the induction and expression of drug-induced behaviors.

Here, we report that distinct bands (low, 30-40 Hz and high gamma, 60-80 Hz) of stimulus triggered gamma oscillations are systematically linked to the orientation selectivity index (OSI) of neurons in the cat primary visual cortex. The gamma-power is high for the highly selective neurons in the low-gamma band, whereas it is high for the broadly selective neurons in the high-gamma band. We suggest that the low-gamma band is principally implicated in feed-forward excitatory flow, whereas the high-gamma band governs the flow of this excitation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Proteotoxicity caused by TDP-43 protein is an important aspect of ALS pathogenesis, with TDP-43 being the main constituent of the aggregates found in patients. We have previously tested the effect of different sugars on the proteotoxicity caused by the expression of mutant TDP-43 in Caenorhabditis elegans. Here we tested maple syrup, a natural compound containing many active molecules including sugars and phenols, for neuroprotective activity.

The study included 47 patients with mTBI referred to an outpatient rehabilitation clinic. The RPQ and a brief neuropsychological battery were performed in the first few days following the trauma. The outcome measure used was the Mayo-Portland Adaptability Inventory-4 (MPAI-4) which was completed within the first 3 months. The only variable associated with results on the MPAI-4 was the RPQ score (p<.001). The predictive outcome model including age, education, and the results of the Trail-Making Test-Parts A and B (TMT) had a pseudo-R-2 of .02. When the RPQ score was added, the pseudo-R-2 climbed to .19. This model indicates that the usefulness of the RPQ score and the TMT in predicting moderate-to-severe limitations, while controlling for confounders, is substantial as suggested by a significant increase in the model chi-square value, delta ((1df))=6.517, p<.001. The RPQ and the TMT provide clinicians with a brief and reliable tool for predicting outcome functioning and can help target the need for further intervention and rehabilitation following mTBI.

GABA Receptors on Orexin and Melanin-Concentrating Hormone Neurons Are Differentially Homeostatically Regulated Following Sleep Deprivation	ENEURO			English	Article						GABA(A)R; GABA(B)R; homeostasis; mice; waking	SLOW-WAVE SLEEP; MCH NEURONS; OREXIN/HYPOCRETIN NEURONS; HYPOCRETIN/OREXIN NEURONS; RAT-BRAIN; NARCOLEPSY; MICE; HYPOTHALAMUS; SYNAPSES; PEPTIDES	Though overlapping in distribution through the hypothalamus, orexin (Orx) and melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) neurons play opposite roles in the regulation of sleep-wake states. Orx neurons discharge during waking, whereas MCH neurons discharge during sleep. In the present study, we examined in mice whether GABAA and GABAB receptors (Rs) are present on Orx and MCH neurons and might undergo differential changes as a function of their different activities following sleep deprivation (SD) and sleep recovery (SR). Applying quantitative stereological image analysis to dual-immunofluorescent stained sections, we determined that the proportion of Orx neurons positively immunostained for GABAARs was significantly higher following SD (similar to 48%) compared with sleep control (SC; similar to 24%) and SR (similar to 27%), and that the luminance of the GABAARs was significantly greater. In contrast, the average proportion of the MCH neurons immunostained for GABAARs was insignificantly lower following SD (similar to 43%) compared with SC (similar to 54%) and SR (56%), and the luminance of the GABAARs was significantly less. Although, GABABRs were observed in all Orx and MCH neurons (100%), the luminance of these receptors was differentially altered following SD. The intensity of GABABRs in the Orx neurons was significantly greater after SD than after SC and SR, whereas that in the MCH neurons was significantly less. The present results indicate that GABA receptors undergo dynamic and differential changes in the wake-active Orx neurons and the sleep-active MCH neurons as a function of and homeostatic adjustment to their preceding activity and sleepwake state.

The morphogen Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) specifies fates of midbrain dopamine neurons, but VTA-specific effects of Shh signaling are also being uncovered. In this study, we assessed the role of the Shh receptor Cdon in the development of VTA and SNc dopamine neurons. We find that Cdon is expressed in the proliferating progenitor zone of the embryonic ventral midbrain and that the number of proliferating cells in this region is increased in mouse Cdon(-/-) embryos. Consistent with a role of Shh in the regulation of neuronal proliferation in this region, we find that the number of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive neurons is increased in the VTA of Cdon(-/-) mice at birth and that this effect endures into adulthood. In contrast, the number of TH-positive neurons in the SNc is not altered in Cdon(-/-) mice at either age. Moreover, adult Cdon(-/-) mice have a greater number of medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) dopamine presynaptic sites, and increased baseline concentrations of dopamine and dopamine metabolites selectively in this region. Finally, consistent with increased dopamine function in the mPFC, we find that adult Cdon(-/-) mice fail to exhibit behavioral plasticity upon repeated amphetamine treatment. Based on these data, we suggest that Cdon plays an important role encoding the diversity of dopamine neurons in the midbrain, influencing both the development of the mesocortical dopamine pathway and behavioral outputs that involve this neural circuitry.

In the developing olfactory epithelium (OE), neural stem/progenitor cells give rise to odorant-detecting olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) and glial-like sustentacular (SUS) cells. Here, we show in mice that the transmembrane receptor neogenin (NEO1) and its membrane-bound ligand RGMB control the balance of neurons and glial cells produced in the OE. In this layered epithelium, neogenin is expressed in progenitor cells, while RGMB is restricted to adjacent newly born ORNs. Ablation of Rgmb via gene-targeting increases the number of dividing progenitor cells in the OE and leads to supernumerary SUS cells. Neogenin loss-of-function phenocopies these effects observed in Rgmb(-/-) mice, supporting the proposal that RGMB-neogenin signaling regulates progenitor cell numbers and SUS cell production. Interestingly, Neo1(-/-) mice also exhibit increased apoptosis of ORNs, implicating additional ligands in the neogenin-dependent survival of ORNs. Thus, our results indicate that RGMB-neogenin-mediated cell-cell interactions between newly born neurons and progenitor cells control the ratio of glia and neurons produced in the OE.

Of these, rod and cone photoreceptors represent the functional unit of light detection and phototransduction and are frequently affected in retinal degenerative diseases. During mouse development, the Polycomb group protein Bmi1 is expressed in immature retinal progenitors and differentiated retinal neurons, including cones. We show here that Bmi1 is required to prevent post natal degeneration of cone photoreceptors and bipolar neurons and that inactivation of Chk2 or p53 could improve but not overcome cone degeneration in Bmi1(-/-) mice. The retinal phenotype of Bmi1(-/-) mice was also characterized by loss of heterochromatin, activation of tandem repeats, oxidative stress and Rip3-associated necroptosis. In the human retina, BMI1 was preferentially expressed in cones at heterochromatic foci. BMI1 inactivation in human embryonic stem cells was compatible with retinal induction but impaired cone terminal differentiation. Despite this developmental arrest, BMI1-deficient cones recapitulated several anomalies observed in Bmi1(-/-) photoreceptors, such as loss of heterochromatin, activation of tandem repeats and induction of p53, revealing partly conserved biological functions between mouse and man.

This pilot study explored the experiences of brain injury survivors after a change in financial management (FM) independence. METHOD. Using a qualitative descriptive design, 6 participants with acquired brain injury were recruited from a community brain injury organization and participated in semistructured interviews. Data were analyzed using thematic analysis. RESULTS. Three themes emerged from the interviews: (1) trajectory of FM change, involving family members as key change agents; (2) current FM situation, involving FM strategies such as automatic deposits and restricted budgets; and (3) the struggle for control, in which survivors desired control while also accepting supports for FM. CONCLUSION. This study identifies some of the challenges brain injury survivors face in managing their finances and the adjustment associated with a loss of FM independence. Occupational therapists should be aware of clients' experiences when supporting them through a change in independence.

However, the importance of wayfinding as a process that regulates human mobility has only recently been incorporated into archeological research design.(5,6) Hominin groups were able to disperse widely during the course of prehistory. The scope of these dispersals speaks to the innate navigation abilities of hominins. Their long-term success must have depended on an ability to communicate spatial information effectively. Here, we consider the extent to which some landscapes may have been more conducive to wayfinding than others. We also describe a tool we have created for quantifying landscape legibility (sensu Gollege(2)), a complex and under-explored concept in archeology, with a view to investigating the impact of landscape structure on human wayfinding and thus, patterns of dispersal during prehistory. To this end, we have developed a method for quantifying legibility using a Geographic Information System (GIS) and apply it to a test case in prehistoric Iberia.

However, identifying prodromal PD is difficult because PD is relatively uncommon, and most markers are nonspecific. Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is by far the strongest clinical marker of prodromal PD, but most patients do not seek out medical attention. Developing an efficient way of diagnosing RBD from the general community may be the most practical method to detect prodromal PD. Methods: We developed a screening strategy that began with a newspaper advertisement containing a single-question screen for RBD. All screen-positive subjects underwent an interview based on the Innsbruck RBD inventory aimed to optimize the positive predictive value. Those who passed both screens underwent confirmatory polysomnography. The proportion of screened RBD patients who met the International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society (MDS) criteria for prodromal PD was assessed. A broad array of clinical markers of neurodegeneration was compared between newspaper-screened RBD patients and 130 RBD patients clinically referred to the sleep center. Results: Of 111 RBD-screen-positive participants, 40 (36%) passed the secondary screen, and 29 underwent full polysomnography. Of these 29 patients, 19 were ultimately proven to have RBD (PPV = 66%), 12 (63%) of whom met the criteria for prodromal PD. Compared to patients referred to the sleep center, newspaper-screened patients had similar age, sex, olfaction, autonomic function, and color vision. However, motor and cognitive assessments were slightly better in newspaper-screened patients. Conclusions: A multistep screening approach using RBD screening questionnaires and telephone follow-up can efficiently identify prodromal PD in the general community. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

This notion, however, is not supported by firm evidence, and it will be challenged here. A general reduction of unit firing has been indeed observed in association with low-voltage fast activity at the onset of seizures recorded during presurgical intracranial monitoring in patients with focal, drug-resistant epilepsies. Moreover, focal seizures in animal models start with increased c-aminobutyric acid (GABA) ergic interneuronal activity that silences principal cells. In vitro studies have shown that synchronous activation of GABAA receptors occurs at seizure onset and causes sizeable elevations in extracellular potassium, thus facilitating neuronal recruitment and seizure progression. A paradoxical involvement of GABAergic networks is required for the initiation of focal seizures characterized by low-voltage fast activity, which represents the most common seizure-onset pattern in focal epilepsies.

J	Chretien, M; Mbikay, M				Chretien, Michel; Mbikay, Majambu			60 YEARS OF POMC From the prohormone theory to pro-opiomelanocortin and to proprotein convertases (PCSK1 to PCSK9)	JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR ENDOCRINOLOGY			English	Review						prohormone; POMC; proprotein convertases; endoproteolysis	AMINO-ACID-SEQUENCE; MELANOCYTE-STIMULATING HORMONE; SHEEP PITUITARY-GLANDS; DENSITY-LIPOPROTEIN CHOLESTEROL; INTERMEDIATE LOBE PEPTIDE; GAMMA-LIPOTROPIC HORMONE; IN-VITRO BIOSYNTHESIS; CELL-FREE TRANSLATION; BETA-LIPOTROPIN; ADRENOCORTICOTROPIC HORMONE	Pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC), is a polyprotein expressed in the pituitary and the brain where it is proteolytically processed into peptide hormones and neuropeptides with distinct biological activities. It is the prototype of multipotent prohormones. The prohormone theory was first suggested in 1967 when Chretien and Li discovered.-lipotropin and observed that (i) it was part of beta-lipotropin (beta-LPH), a larger polypeptide characterized 2 years earlier and (ii) its C-terminus was beta-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (beta-MSH). This discovery led them to propose that the lipotropins might be related biosynthetically to the biologically active beta-MSH in a precursor to end product relationship. The theory was widely confirmed in subsequent years. As we celebrate the 50th anniversary of the sequencing of beta-LPH, we reflect over the lessons learned from the sequencing of those proteins; we explain their extension to the larger POMC precursor; we examine how the theory of precursor endoproteolysis they inspired became relevant for vast fields in biology; and how it led, after a long and arduous search, to the novel proteolytic enzymes called proprotein convertases. This family of nine enzymes plays multifaceted functions in growth, development, metabolism, endocrine, and brain functions. Their genetics has provided many insights into health and disease. Their therapeutic targeting is foreseeable in the near future. Thus, what started five decades ago as a theory based on POMC fragments, has opened up novel and productive avenues of biological and medical research, including, for our own current interest, a highly intriguing hypocholesterolemic Gln152His PCSK9 mutation in French-Canadian families.

These inputs are integrated at specific regulatory sequences within the promoter and pituitary or hypothalamic enhancers of the POMC locus. Investigations of developmental mechanisms and transcription factors (TFs) responsible for pituitary activation of POMC transcription led to the discovery of the Pitx factors that have critical roles in pituitary development and striking patterning functions in embryonic development. Terminal differentiation of the two pituitary POMC lineages, the corticotrophs and melanotrophs, is controlled by Tpit; mutations of the human TPIT gene cause isolated adrenocorticotrophic hormone deficiency. Intermediate lobe and melanotroph identity is provided by the pioneer TF Pax7 that remodels chromatin to reveal a new repertoire of enhancers for Tpit action. Many signaling pathways regulate POMC transcription including activation by hypothalamic corticotrophin-releasing hormone acting through the orphan nuclear receptors of the Nur family and feedback repression by glucocorticoids and their glucocorticoid receptor. TFs of the basic helix-loop-helix, Smad, Stat, Etv, and nuclear factor-B families also mediate signals for control of POMC transcription. Whereas most of these regulatory processes are conserved in different species, there are also notable differences between specific targets for regulation of the human compared with mouse POMC genes.

To better understand the phenotype associated with CHD8 mutations, we genotyped all CHD8 exons in carefully assessed cohorts of autism (n = 142), schizophrenia (SCZ; n = 143), and intellectual disability (ID; n = 94). We identified one frameshift mutation, seven non-synonymous variants, and six synonymous variants. The frameshift mutation, p.Asn2092Lysfs*2, which creates a premature stop codon leading to the loss of 212 amino acids of the protein, was from an autism case on whom we present multiple clinical assessments and pharmacological treatments spanning more than 10 years. RNA and protein analysis support a model where the transcript generated from the mutant allele results in haploinsufficiency of CHD8. This case report supports the association of CHD8 mutations with classical autism, macrocephaly, infantile hypotonia, speech delay, lack of major ID, and psychopathology in late adolescence caused by insufficient dosage of CHD8. Review of 16 other CHD8 mutation cases suggests that clinical features and their severity vary considerably across individuals; however, these data support a CHD8 mutation syndrome, further highlighting the importance of genomic medicine to guide clinical assessment and treatment.

Trillions of commensal microbes live in and on our body, and constitute the human microbiome. The vast majority of these microorganisms are maternally derived and live in the gut, where they perform functions essential to our health and survival, including: digesting food, activating certain drugs, producing short-chain fatty acids (which help to modulate gene expression by inhibiting the deacetylation of histone proteins), generating anti-inflammatory substances, and playing a fundamental role in the induction, training, and function of our immune system. Among the many roles the microbiome ultimately plays, it mitigates against untoward effects from our exposure to the environment by forming a biotic shield between us and the outside world. The importance of physical activity coupled with a balanced and healthy diet in the maintenance of our well-being has been recognized since antiquity. However, it is only recently that characterization of the host-microbiome intermetabolic and crosstalk pathways has come to the forefront in studying therapeutic design. As reviewed in this report, synthetic biology shows potential in developing microorganisms for correcting pathogenic dysbiosis (gut microbiota-host maladaptation), although this has yet to be proven. However, the development and use of small molecule drugs have a long and successful history in the clinic, with small molecule histone deacetylase inhibitors representing one relevant example already approved to treat cancer and other disorders. Moreover, preclinical research suggests that epigenetic treatment of neurological conditions holds significant promise. With the mouth being an extension of the digestive tract, it presents a readily accessible diagnostic site for the early detection of potential unhealthy pathogens resident in the gut. Taken together, the data outlined herein provide an encouraging road-map toward important new medicines and companion diagnostic platforms in a wide range of therapeutic indications.

J	Zlatkina, V; Amiez, C; Petrides, M				Zlatkina, Veronika; Amiez, Celine; Petrides, Michael			The postcentral sulcal complex and the transverse postcentral sulcus and their relation to sensorimotor functional organization	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						functional magnetic resonance imaging; human; postcentral sulcus; sensorimotor cortex; transverse postcentral sulcus	PRIMARY SOMATOSENSORY CORTEX; PRIMARY MOTOR CORTEX; HIGH-RESOLUTION FMRI; HUMAN-BRAIN; PARIETAL CORTEX; INTERINDIVIDUAL VARIABILITY; MACAQUE MONKEYS; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; AREA 3B; CORTICOCORTICAL CONNECTIONS	It has been demonstrated that the postcentral sulcus, which forms the posterior boundary of the sensorimotor region, is a complex of distinct sulcal segments. Although the general somatotopic arrangement in the human sensorimotor cortex is relatively well known, we do not know whether the different segments of the postcentral sulcus relate in a systematic way to the sensorimotor functional representations. Participants were scanned with functional magnetic resonance imaging while they made movements of different body parts and the location of functional activity was examined on a subject-by-subject basis with respect to the morphological features of the postcentral sulcus. The findings demonstrate that the postcentral sulcus of each subject may be divided into five segments and there is a tight relationship between sensorimotor representations of different body parts and specific segments of the postcentral sulcus. The results also addressed the issue of the transverse postcentral sulcus, a short sulcus that is present within the ventral part of the postcentral gyrus in some brains. It was shown that, when present, this sulcus is functionally related to the oral (mouth and tongue) sensorimotor representation. When this sulcus is not present, the inferior postcentral sulcus which is also related to the oral representation is longer. Thus, the sulcal morphology provides an improved framework for functional assignments in individual subjects.

Functional impairments in cellular pathways controlling genomic stability, and immune control have been identified. Biomarker of immune senescence is needed to improve vaccine response and to develop therapy to improve immune control. To identify phenotypic signature of circulating immune cells with aging, we enrolled 1068 Chinese healthy volunteers ranging from 18 to 80 years old. The decreased naive CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, increased memory CD4+ or CD8+ T cells, loss of CD28 expression on T cells and reverse trend of CD38 and HLA-DR, were significant for aging of immune system. Conversely, the absolute counts and percentage of NK cells and CD19+B cells maintained stable in aging individuals. The Chinese reference ranges of absolute counts and percentage of peripheral lymphocyte in this study might be useful for future clinical evaluation.

Primary Failure of Thoracic Epidural Analgesia in Training Centers The Invisible Elephant?

In addition to the difficult anatomy of the thoracic spine, the conventional end point-loss-of-resistance-lacks specificity. Furthermore, insufficient training compounds the problem: learning curves are nonexistent, pedagogical requirements are often inadequate, supervisors may be inexperienced, and exposure during residency is decreasing. Any viable solution needs to be multifaceted. Learning curves should be explored to determine the minimal number of blocks required for proficiency. The problem of decreasing caseload can be tackled with epidural simulators to supplement in vivo learning. From a technical standpoint, fluoroscopy and ultrasonography could be used to navigate the complex anatomy of the thoracic spine. Finally, correct identification of the thoracic epidural space should be confirmed with objective, real-time modalities such as neurostimulation and waveform analysis.	[Tran, De Q.

Our objective was to determine the rate of utilization of the HIT in the emergency room (ER). Methods: A retrospective chart review of patients presenting to the ER over one year who received a final diagnosis of dizziness or vertigo. Details of clinical examinations, investigations, and diagnosis were recorded. Patients were grouped into episodic, acute constant, and chronic vertigo groups. Results: HIT was performed in only 31 of 642 (5%) patients with vertigo. In the acute constant group it was negative in 6 of 6 patients ultimately diagnosed with stroke and positive in 6 of 13 cases of peripheral vertigo. Discussion: Despite good published evidence regarding its use the HIT is under-utilized in the ER. Physicians need to be aware of the HIT and newer video HITs and make use of them in practice.

Canadian Paediatric Neurology Workforce Survey and Consensus Statement	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF NEUROLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						education; neurology - pediatric	CHILD NEUROLOGISTS	Background: Little knowledge exists on the availability of academic and community paediatric neurology positions. This knowledge is crucial for making workforce decisions. Our study aimed to: 1) obtain information regarding the availability of positions for paediatric neurologists in academic centres; 2) survey paediatric neurology trainees regarding their perceptions of employment issues and career plans; 3) survey practicing community paediatric neurologists 4) convene a group of paediatric neurologists to develop consensus regarding how to address these workforce issues. Methods: Surveys addressing workforce issues regarding paediatric neurology in Canada were sent to: 1) all paediatric neurology program directors in Canada (n = 9) who then solicited information from division heads and from paediatric neurologists in surrounding areas; 2) paediatric neurology trainees in Canada (n = 57) and; 3) community paediatric neurologists (n = 27). A meeting was held with relevant stakeholders to develop a consensus on how to approach employment issues. Results: The response rate was 100% from program directors, 57.9% from residents and 44% from community paediatric neurologists. We found that the number of projected positions in academic paediatric neurology is fewer than the number of paediatric neurologists that are being trained over the next five to ten years, despite a clinical need for paediatric neurologists. Paediatric neurology residents are concerned about job availability and desire more career counselling. Conclusions: There is a current and projected clinical demand for paediatric neurologists despite a lack of academic positions. Training programs should focus on community neurology as a viable career option.

J	Menard, L; Perrier, P; Aubin, J				Menard, Lucie; Perrier, Pascal; Aubin, Jerome			Compensation for a lip-tube perturbation in 4-year-olds: Articulatory, acoustic, and perceptual data analyzed in comparison with adults	JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA			English	Article							SPEECH MOTOR CONTROL; FRENCH VOWELS; INTERNAL-MODELS; SOMATOSENSORY FEEDBACK; AUDITORY-FEEDBACK; NEURAL THEORY; ARM MOVEMENT; CHILDREN; ACQUISITION; STRATEGIES	The nature of the speech goal in children was investigated in a study of compensation strategies for a lip-tube perturbation. Acoustic, articulatory, and perceptual analyses of the vowels /y/ and /u/ produced by ten 4-year-old French speakers and ten adult French speakers were conducted under two conditions: normal and with a large tube inserted between the lips. Ultrasound and acoustic recordings of isolated vowels were made in the normal condition before any perturbation, for each of the trials in the perturbed condition, and in the normal condition after the perturbed trials. Data revealed that adult participants moved their tongues in the perturbed condition more than children did. The perturbation was generally at least partly compensated for during the perturbed trials in adults, but children did not show a typical learning effect. In particular, unsystematic improvements were observed during the sequence of perturbed trials, and after-effects were not clear in the articulatory domain. This suggests that children may establish associative links between multisensory phonemic representations and articulatory maneuvers, but those links may mainly rely on trial-to-trial, error-based feedback correction mechanisms rather than on the internal model of the speech production apparatus, as they are in adults.

Effects of a pretarget distractor on saccade reaction times across space and time in monkeys and humans	JOURNAL OF VISION			English	Article						superior colliculus; attention; facilitation; inhibition of return; remote distractor effect	PRIMATE SUPERIOR COLLICULUS; PROACTIVE INHIBITORY CONTROL; STEM OMNIPAUSE NEURONS; EYE-MOVEMENT LATENCIES; EXTENDED FIXATION ZONE; SPATIAL ATTENTION; COMPETITIVE INTEGRATION; TARGET SELECTION; PARIETAL LOBE; INTERMEDIATE LAYERS	Previous studies have shown that the influence of a behaviorally irrelevant distractor on saccade reaction times (SRTs) varies depending on the temporal and spatial relationship between the distractor and the saccade target. We measured distractor influence on SRTs to a subsequently presented target, varying the spatial location and the timing between the distractor and the target. The distractor appeared at one of four equally eccentric locations, followed by a target (either 50 ms or 200 ms after) at one of 136 different locations encompassing an area of 208 square. We extensively tested two humans and two monkeys on this task to determine interspecies similarities and differences, since monkey neurophysiology is often used to interpret human behavioral findings. Results were similar across species; for the short interval (50 ms), SRTs were shortest to a target presented close to or at the distractor location and increased primarily as a function of the distance from the distractor. There was also an effect of distractor-target direction and visual field. For the long interval (200 ms) the results were inverted; SRTs were longest for short distances between the distractor and target and decreased as a function of distance from distractor. Both SRT patterns were well captured by a two-dimensional dynamic field model with short-distance excitation and long-distance inhibition, based upon known functional connectivity found in the superior colliculus that includes wide-spread excitation and inhibition. Based on these findings, we posit that the different time-dependent patterns of distractor-related SRTs can emerge from the same underlying neuronal mechanisms common to both species.

OBJECTIVES: We evaluated associations between biomarkers of prenatal and postnatal OP exposure and cognitive function of 6-year-olds in a French longitudinal birth cohort. METHODS: In 2002-2006, the PELAGIE mother-child cohort enrolled pregnant women from Brittany. For a random subcohort, we measured nonspecific dialkylphosphate metabolites (DAP) of OP in one maternal urine sample, collected before 19 weeks' gestation, and in one urine sample collected from their 6-year-old children. Six subtests of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, 4th edition (WISC-IV) were administered when the children were 6 years of age to evaluate cognitive function (n = 231). Linear regression models controlling for factors including maternal intelligence and the Home Observation for Measurement of the Environment score were used. RESULTS: WISC-IV scores were not significantly associated with prenatal or childhood total DAP metabolites. WISC verbal comprehension score was significantly higher in association with the highest maternal urinary concentrations of diethylphosphate (DE) metabolites (5.5; 95% CI: 0.8, 10.3 for > 13.2 nmol/L vs. < LOQ), whereas WISC working memory score was significantly lower in association with the highest urinary concentrations of DE metabolites at age 6 years (-3.6; 95% CI: -7.8, -0.6 for > 11.1 nmol/L vs. < LOD). CONCLUSION: We found no evidence that prenatal OP exposure adversely affected cognitive function in 6-year-olds, perhaps because of the population's socioeconomic status, which was higher than in previous studies, though other causal and noncausal explanations are also possible. The negative association between WISC score and concurrent DE urinary concentrations requires replication by longitudinal studies investigating childhood OP exposure.

The number of genomic copies in this region is inversely correlated with body mass index (BMI): the deletion is associated with a highly penetrant form of obesity (present in 50% of carriers by the age of 7 years and in 70% of adults), and the duplication with being underweight. Mechanisms underlying this energy imbalance remain unknown. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate eating behavior, cognitive traits and their relationships with BMI in carriers of 16p11.2 CNVs. METHODS: We assessed individuals carrying a 16p11.2 deletion or duplication and their intrafamilial controls using food-related behavior questionnaires and cognitive measures. We also compared these carriers with cohorts of individuals presenting with obesity, binge eating disorder or bulimia. RESULTS: Response to satiety is gene dosage-dependent in pediatric CNV carriers. Altered satiety response is present in young deletion carriers before the onset of obesity. It remains altered in adolescent carriers and correlates with obesity. Adult deletion carriers exhibit eating behavior similar to that seen in a cohort of obesity without eating disorders such as bulimia or binge eating. None of the cognitive measures are associated with eating behavior or BMI. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that abnormal satiety response is a strong contributor to the energy imbalance in 16p11.2 CNV carriers, and, akin to other genetic forms of obesity, altered satiety responsiveness in children precedes the increase in BMI observed later in adolescence.

High Oestradiol Replacement Reverses Response Memory Bias in Ovariectomised Female Rats Regardless of Dopamine Levels in the DorsalStriatum	JOURNAL OF NEUROENDOCRINOLOGY			English	Article						oestrogen; striatum; lateralisation; asymmetry; multiple memory systems	ELICITED ROTATIONAL BEHAVIOR; CYCLE-DEPENDENT VARIATION; STRIATAL DOPAMINE; ESTROUS-CYCLE; SEX-DIFFERENCES; NUCLEUS-ACCUMBENS; LEARNING-STRATEGY; CAUDATE-NUCLEUS; UPTAKE SITES; SYSTEM BIAS	Oestrogens influence memory system bias in female rats such that high levels of oestrogen are associated with place (or spatial) memory use, and low oestrogen levels with response (or habitual) memory use. Moreover, striatal-dependent response memory is sensitive to dopamine transmission in the dorsal striatum, and oestrogens have been shown to affect dopamine release in that brain area. In the present study, the effects of oestrogens and dopamine transmission on multiple memory system bias were explored in ovariectomised rats receiving low or high 17-oestradiol replacement under saline, autoreceptor-activating doses of the dopamine D-2 receptor agonist, apomorphine (50 and 80g/kg), or amphetamine (0.5mg/kg) administration. Furthermore, dorsal striatal dopamine release was measured after administration of the same drug conditions using invivo microdialysis. As expected, high oestradiol rats predominantly used place memory, whereas the opposite pattern was observed in low oestradiol rats. However, the high apomorphine dose statistically significantly altered memory bias in high oestradiol rats from predominant place to predominant response memory, with a similar trend in the low apomorphine dose and the amphetamine group. There was no effect of drugs on memory bias in low oestradiol rats. Rats with high oestradiol replacement receiving amphetamine exhibited greater dorsal striatal dopamine release than low oestradiol replacement rats, and this difference was amplified in the right hemisphere. Furthermore, a logistic regression analysis revealed that oestradiol, but not dorsal striatal dopamine levels, significantly predicted response memory bias. These findings provide further evidence that oestradiol modulates memory system bias, and also that memory bias is changed by systemic apomorphine administration. However, although oestradiol affects dopamine transmission in the dorsal striatum in a lateralised manner, this does not predict memory system bias.	[Hussain, D.; Cossette, M. -P.; Brake, W.

Hawkins et al. (J Neurophysiol 114: 40-47, 2015) used a sophisticated curve-fitting procedure to show that these models are discriminable and thus testable in constant evidence tasks. In this Neuro Forum article I raise possible limitations of such an approach, discuss some of its implications, and propose alternative solutions.

Most previous studies have characterized visual responses of neurons using stereotyped stimuli such as bars, gratings, or white noise and simple system identification approaches (e.g., reverse correlation). Here we estimate visual RF models of cortical neurons using visually rich natural image stimuli and regularized regression system identification methods and characterize their spatial tuning, temporal dynamics, spatiotemporal behavior, and spiking properties. We quantitatively demonstrate the existence of three functionally distinct categories of simple cells, distinguished by their degree of orientation selectivity (isotropic or oriented) and the nature of their output nonlinearity (expansive or compressive). In addition, these three types have differing average values of several other properties. Cells with nonoriented RFs tend to have smaller RFs, shorter response durations, no direction selectivity, and high reliability. Orientation-selective neurons with an expansive output nonlinearity have Gabor-like RFs, lower spontaneous activity and responsivity, and spiking responses with higher sparseness. Oriented RFs with a compressive nonlinearity are spatially nondescript and tend to show longer response latency. Our findings indicate multiple physiologically defined types of RFs beyond the simple/complex dichotomy, suggesting that cortical neurons may have more specialized functional roles rather than lying on a multidimensional continuum.

Flap versus fascial closure for gastroschisis: a systematic review and meta-analysis	JOURNAL OF PEDIATRIC SURGERY			English	Review						Gastroschisis; Systematic review; Meta-analysis; Flap closure	MINIMAL INTERVENTION MANAGEMENT; WARD REDUCTION; INFECTIOUS COMPLICATIONS; GENERAL-ANESTHESIA; PLASTIC CLOSURE; NO ANESTHESIA; NEONATAL UNIT; NEURODEVELOPMENT; OUTCOMES; INFANTS	Background: Flap closure represents an alternative to fascial closure for gastroschisis. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of outcomes comparing these techniques. Methods: A registered systematic review (PROSPERO: CRD42015016745) of comparative studies was performed, querying multiple databases without language or date restrictions. Gray literature was sought. Outcomes analyzed included: mortality, ventilation days, feeding parameters, length of stay (LOS), wound infection, resource utilization, and umbilical hernia incidence. Multiple reviewers independently assessed study eligibility and literature quality. Meta-analysis of outcomes was performed where appropriate (Revman 5.2). Results: Twelve studies met inclusion criteria, of which three were multi-institutional. Quality assessment revealed unbiased patient selection and exposure, but group comparability was suboptimal in four studies. Overall, 1124 patients were evaluated, of which 350 underwent flap closure (210 immediately; 140 post-silo). Metaanalysis revealed no significant differences in mortality, LOS, or feeding parameters between groups. Flap patients had lesswound infections (OR 0.40 [95%CI 0.22-0.74], P = 0.003). While flap patients had an increased risk of umbilical hernia, they were less likely to undergo repair (19% vs. 41%; P = 0.01). Conclusions: Flap closure has equivalent or superior outcomes to fascial closure for patients with gastroschisis. Given potential advantages of bedside closure and reduced sedation requirements, flap closure may represent the preferred closure strategy. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Inc.

A significant treatment difference favoring nab-P + Gem over Gem was observed for OS in patients treated in North America. The majority of patients were from the US (88%) with only 12% from Canada. Healthcare systems and treatment patterns are different between the 2 countries, and there is limited published information on outcomes of Canadian patients treated with first-line nab-P + Gem. This analysis evaluated efficacy and safety outcomes in Canadian patients in the MPACT trial. Treatment-naive patients with MPC (N = 861) received either nab-P 125 mg/m(2) + Gem 1000 mg/m(2) on days 1, 8, and 15 every 4 weeks or Gem 1000 mg/m(2) weekly for the first 7 of 8 weeks (cycle 1) and then on days 1, 8, and 15 every 4 weeks (cycle a parts per thousand yen2). The MPACT trial enrolled 63 patients in Canada. Baseline characteristics were well balanced and comparable with those of the intent-to-treat population. Both OS (median 11.9 vs. 7.1 months; HR 0.76; P = 0.373) and progression-free survival (median 7.2 vs. 5.2 months; HR 0.65; P = 0.224) were numerically longer and overall response rate (27% vs. 17%; P = 0.312) was numerically higher with nab-P + Gem vs. Gem. The most common grade a parts per thousand yen3 adverse events with nab-P + Gem vs. Gem were neutropenia (22% vs. 10%), fatigue (34% vs. 33%), and neuropathy (25% vs. 0%). This subanalysis confirmed that nab-P + Gem is an efficacious treatment option and has a manageable safety profile in patients with MPC treated in Canada. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier, NCT00844649.

The aim of this study was to investigate the occurrence of an unreported phenomenon of a paradoxically decreased mean transit time (MTT) in the cerebral area of ischemia. Methods: In this retrospective study, patients with an acute anterior circulation ischemic stroke were selected. Computed tomography perfusion diffusion maps of all patients were reviewed by 2 blinded and experienced neuroradiologists. Results: A total of 31 patients were included in the study. Eighteen subjects (58%) had a paradoxical MTT perfusion map, whereas only 13 (42%) had an expected CTP profile. No significant associations between the paradoxical MTT perfusion and the size of the infarct, the side of the occlusion, or the age of the patients were observed. However, a trend in collateral circulation status and paradoxical MTT was noted. Conclusions: A paradoxical MTT response is a frequent finding in CTP analysis of patients with acute stroke. Its presence is not associated to the location or size of the affected cerebral territory and could be related to the presence of collateral circulation.

The main features of the proposed DSC method are that 1) by using a transformation function, the prescribed transient performance of the tracking error can be guaranteed; 2) by estimating the norm of the unknown weighted vector of the neural network, the computational burden can be greatly reduced; 3) by using the DSC method, the explosion of complexity problem is eliminated. It is proved that the proposed scheme guarantees all the closed-loop signals being uniformly ultimately bounded. The simulation results show the validity of the proposed control scheme.

Strengths, challenges and recommendations	BRITISH JOURNAL OF OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY			English	Article						Traumatic brain injury; vocational evaluation; return to work; employment; guidelines	CLINICAL-PRACTICE GUIDELINES; FACTORS RELEVANT; WORK; REHABILITATION; IMPLEMENTATION; RETURN	Introduction: To support implementation of the Inter-professional Guideline for Vocational Evaluation Following Traumatic Brain Injury we compared current practices to best practices as outlined in the guideline. Method: We recruited health/vocational professionals who do vocational evaluation of traumatic brain injury survivors to participate in qualitative semi-structured interviews. We also conducted a document review of internal clinical and provincial workers' compensation insurance documents. All data were analyzed using directed content analysis. Results: Thirteen individuals participated and three types of documents were reviewed. Practices that were found to be frequently aligned with the Inter-professional Guideline for Vocational Evaluation Following Traumatic Brain Injury included: (a) identification of evaluation purpose; (b) obtaining informed consent; (c) gathering background information; (d) assessing persistent symptoms and abilities; (e) analyzing and synthesizing results; and (f) developing return to work recommendations. Practices partially aligned included: (a) incorporating the worker's perspectives into the evaluation; (b) observing work behaviors in naturalistic settings (c) assessing available supports; and (d) assessing occupational/job demands in context. Practices that did not align with the guideline included: (a) evaluation of the workplace environment and workplace supports; (b) accommodation potential; and (c) assessment of workplace safety. Conclusion: To support implementation of the guideline and enhance successful vocational outcomes, additional attention and resources should be dedicated to evaluating workplace-based factors and assessing workplace-based risks.

Effect of Insulin Therapy using Hyper-insulinemic Normoglycemic Clamp on Inflammatory Response in Brain Dead Organ Donors	EXPERIMENTAL AND CLINICAL ENDOCRINOLOGY & DIABETES			English	Article						hormones; adipocytokines; transplantation; brain dead donors; inflammation	NECROSIS-FACTOR-ALPHA; LIVER-TRANSPLANTATION; EARLY PHASE; INJURY; INTERLEUKIN-6; DYSFUNCTION; HYPERGLYCEMIA; HEMORRHAGE; PROTECTION; MANAGEMENT	Background: Brain death is a major stress that is associated with a massive inflammatory response and systemic hyperglycemia. Severe inflammation leads to increased graft immunogenicity and risk of graft dysfunction; while acute hyperglycemia aggravates the inflammatory response and increases the risk of morbidity and mortality. Insulin therapy not only controls hyperglycemia but also suppresses inflammation. The present study is to investigate the anti-inflammatory properties and the normoglycemia maintenance of high dose insulin on brain dead organ donors. Design: 15 brain dead organ donors were divided into 2 groups, insulin treated (n = 6) and controls (n = 9). Insulin was provided for a minimum of 6 h using the hyperinsulinemic normoglycemic clamp technique. The changes of serum cytokines, including IL-6, IL-10, IL-1 beta, IL-8, TNF alpha, TGF alpha and MCP-1, were measured by suspension bead array immunoassay and glucose by a glucose monitor. Results: Compared to controls, insulin treated donors had a significant lower blood glucose 4.8 (4-6.9) vs. 9 (5.6-11.7) mmol/L, p < 0.01); the net decreases of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6 and MCP-1, and the net increase of antiinflammatory cytokine, such as IL-10, reached significant level in insulin treated donors compared with those in controls. Conclusion: High dose insulin therapy decreases the concentrations of inflammatory cytokines in brain dead donors and preserves normoglycemia. High dose of insulin may have anti-inflammatory effects in brain dead organ donors and therefore, improve the quality of donor organs and potentially improve outcomes.

Preparation of embryonic retinal explants to study CNS neurite growth	EXPERIMENTAL EYE RESEARCH			English	Article						Retinal explant; Retinal ganglion cell; Neurite growth	GANGLION-CELLS; AXON REGENERATION; OPTIC-NERVE; ORGANOTYPIC CULTURE; PROGENITOR CELLS; CONE COLLAPSE; ADULT-RATS; IN-VIVO; MOUSE; NEURONS	This protocol outlines the preparation of embryonic mouse retinal explants, which provides an effective technique to analyze neurite outgrowth in central nervous system (CNS) neurons. This validated ex vivo system, which displays limited neuronal death, is highly reproducible and particularly amenable to manipulation. Our previously published studies involving embryonic chick or adult mouse retinal ex plants were instrumental in the preparation of this protocol; aspects of these previous techniques were combined, adopted and optimized. This protocol thus permits more efficient analysis of neurite growth. Briefly, the retina is dissected from the embryonic mouse eye using precise techniques that take into account the small size of the embryonic eye. The approach applied ensures that the retinal ganglion cell (RGC) layer faces the adhesion substrate on coated cover slips. Neurite growth is clear, well-delineated and readily quantifiable. These retinal explants can therefore be used to examine the neurite growth effects elicited by potential therapeutic agents. (c) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Although the amount of OP pesticides being used is declining, especially in developed countries, OPs continue being one of the most important classes of insecticides and chemical warfare agents today due to its toxic effects on the enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE). Existing research on the toxicological effects of OPs is extensive, however, there is a lack of knowledge on the long-term effects of low levels of OPs and their exactly pathways of toxicity. Recent data prove that other molecular targets than AChE could be targeted by OPs, triggering these effects. Here these data are reviewed and it is highlighted that the current uses of OPs are producing several neurotoxic effects. It is also shown that, to protect people from possible uses and misuses of OPs, more regulations on OPs are needed. Moreover, more mechanistic studies are needed to completely understand their toxicological interactions and mechanisms of action and to identify the whole group of enzymes that interact with them.

This study prospectively examines the long-term relationship between early childhood exposure to household smoke and two adiposity-related measures at age 10. Methods: Participants from the Quebec Longitudinal Study of Child Development birth cohort were categorized into one of three groups of early childhood household exposure to tobacco smoke over four time points (from ages 1 to 7 years): never-exposed; transient exposure; and continuous exposure. Follow-up measures of body mass index and waist circumference were independently assessed at age 10. Results: Compared to being never exposed, transient and continuous household smoke exposure predicted increases of 0.93 cm (95% confidence interval [CI] between 0.05 and 1.82 cm; P = .03) and 1.56 cm (95% CI between 0.07 and 3.05 cm; P = .04) in children's waist circumference, respectively. Children exposed to transient and continuous household smoke, compared to unexposed children, also showed 0.48 and 0.81 point increases in their body mass index, respectively, both Ps = .005. Once adjusted, for confounding variables, only transient household smoke remained associated with 43% greater odds of belonging to the overweight/obese category (95% CI between 1.12 and 1.81 cm; P < .01). Conclusions: We found significant long-term prospective associations between home-based secondhand smoke exposure and unhealthy body fat distribution. Waist circumference in youth has become an important risk factor for obesity-related diseases in adulthood. Our findings emphasize the importance public health initiatives and parental sensitization aimed at domestic exposure reductions during the critical early childhood years.

An extension of the social brains hypothesis, known as the cooperative breeding brain hypothesis, postulates that cooperatively breeding species, which live in stable social groups and provide allocare, face particularly pronounced cognitive demands because they must recognize, remember, and differentially respond to multiple group members. These socio-cognitive challenges are thought to have selected for increased cognitive capacity, supported by a bigger brain. To test the prediction that cooperative breeders have larger brains, we performed a phylogenetically controlled comparison of the whole brain masses of adult fish from 16 closely related species of cooperatively and independently breeding lamprologine cichlid species from Lake Tanganyika. We collected data on brain mass from males of eight species of lamprologine cichlids and added this to brain mass data from eight more species found in the published literature. Controlling for body size and phylogeny, we found that cooperative breeding species did not have larger brains, and this was true of for both our field-collected data set and the expanded data set including published values. This study adds to a growing body of literature from other taxa that cast doubt on the cooperative breeding brain hypothesis.

In parallel, the beneficial effect of a high omega-3 PUFA diet on infarct size can be attenuated by increased omega-6 PUFA consumption. The present study was designed to determine if augmented linoleic acid (LA), an omega-6 PUFA administered at the same time, attenuates the cardioprotective action of RvD1. Male Sprague Dawley rats received 0.1 mu g RvD1 alone or with one of three LA doses (1, 5 or 10 mu g) directly into the left ventricle chamber 5 min before ischemia. The animals underwent 40 min of ischemia by occlusion of the left descending coronary artery followed by 30 min or 24 h of reperfusion. Infarct size and neutrophil accumulation were evaluated after 24 h of reperfusion, while caspase-3,-8 and -9 and Akt activities were assessed at 30 min of reperfusion. LA attenuated cardioprotection afforded by RvD1, resulting in significantly increased infarct size. Neutrophil accumulation and Akt activity were similar between groups. Caspase activities, especially caspase-9, which could be activated by ischemia, were stimulated in the presence of LA, suggesting that this omega-6 PUFA accentuates ischemia intensity. The present results indicate that LA significantly attenuates the beneficial effect of RvD1 on infarct size. Therefore, reduction of omega-6 intake should be considered to maintain the protection afforded by RvD1. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Based on the neural responses of early visual cortical areas, injury to the visual cortex would be predicted to affect both 1st order and 2nd order contrast sensitivity functions (CSFs) the height and/or the cut-off of the CSF are expected to be affected by TBI. Previous studies have reported disruptions only in 2nd order contrast sensitivity, but using a narrow range of parameters and divergent methodologies no study has characterized the effect of TBI on the full CSF for both 1st and 2nd order stimuli. Such information is needed to properly understand the effect of TBI on contrast perception, which underlies all visual processing. Using a unified framework based on the quick contrast sensitivity function, we measured full CSFs for static and dynamic 1st and 2nd order stimuli. Our results provide a unique dataset showing alterations in sensitivity for both 1st and 2nd order visual stimuli. In particular, we show that TBI patients have increased sensitivity for 1st order motion stimuli and decreased sensitivity to orientation-defined and contrast-defined 2nd order stimuli. In addition, our data suggest that TBI patients' sensitivity for both 1st order stimuli and 2nd order contrast-defined stimuli is shifted towards higher spatial frequencies. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Importantly, the neuro-anatomical foundation for later alcohol-related problems may already manifest pre-natally, particularly due to smoking and alcohol consumption during pregnancy. In this context, cortical gyrification is an interesting marker of neuronal development but has not been investigated as a risk factor for adolescent alcohol use. On magnetic resonance imaging scans of 595 14-year-old adolescents from the IMAGEN sample, we computed whole-brain mean curvature indices to predict change in alcohol-related problems over the following 2 years. Change of alcohol use-related problems was significantly predicted from mean curvature in left orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). Less gyrification of OFC was associated with an increase in alcohol use-related problems over the next 2 years. Moreover, lower gyrification in left OFC was related to pre-natal alcohol exposure, whereas maternal smoking during pregnancy had no effect. Current alcohol use-related problems of the biological mother had no effect on offsprings' OFC gyrification or drinking behaviour. The data support the idea that alcohol consumption during pregnancy mediates the development of neuro-anatomical phenotypes, which in turn constitute a risk factor for increasing problems due to alcohol consumption in a vulnerable stage of life. Maternal smoking during pregnancy or current maternal alcohol/nicotine consumption had no significant effect. The OFC mediates behaviours known to be disturbed in addiction, namely impulse control and reward processing. The results stress the importance of pre-natal alcohol exposure for later increases in alcohol use-related problems, mediated by structural brain characteristics.

Inter- and Intrarater Agreement on the Outcome of Endovascular Treatment of Aneurysms Using MRA	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY			English	Article							CERECYTE COIL TRIAL; BARE PLATINUM COILS; INTRACRANIAL ANEURYSMS; FOLLOW-UP; CEREBRAL ANEURYSMS; RANDOMIZED-TRIAL; ANGIOGRAPHY-MULTICENTER; RECURRENCE LITERATURE; UNRUPTURED ANEURYSMS; OBSERVER AGREEMENT	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Patients treated with coiling are often followed by MR angiography. Our objective was to assess the inter- and intraobserver agreement in diagnosing aneurysm remnants and recurrences by using multimodality imaging, including TOF MRA. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A portfolio composed of 120 selected images from 56 patients was sent to 15 neuroradiologists from 10 institutions. For each case, raters were asked to classify angiographic results (3 classes) of 2 studies (32 MRA-MRA and 24 DSA-MRA pairs) and to provide a final judgment regarding the presence of a recurrence (no, minor, major). Six raters were asked to independently review the portfolio twice. A second study, restricted to 4 raters having full access to all images, was designed to validate the results of the electronic survey. RESULTS: The proportion of cases judged to have a major recurrence varied between 16.1% and 71.4% (mean, 35.0% +/- 12.7%). There was moderate agreement overall (kappa = 0.474 +/- 0.009), increasing to nearly substantial (kappa = 0.581 +/- 0.014) when the judgment was dichotomized (presence or absence of a major recurrence). Agreement on cases followed-up by MRA-MRA was similarly substantial (kappa = 0.601 +/- 0.018). The intrarater agreement varied between fair (kappa = 0.257 +/- 0.093) and substantial (kappa= 0.699 +/- 0.084), improving with a dichotomized judgment concerning MRA-MRA comparisons. Agreement was no better when raters had access to all images. CONCLUSIONS: There is an important variability in the assessment of angiographic outcomes of endovascular treatments. Agreement on the presence of a major recurrence when comparing 2 MRA studies or the MRA with the last catheter angiographic study can be substantial.

Inter-relation between autonomic and HPA axis activity in children and adolescents	BIOLOGICAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						Autonomic nervous system; Heart rate variability; Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis; Diurnal cortisol profile; Children; Adolescents; Perceived stress	HEART-RATE-VARIABILITY; CORTICOTROPIN-RELEASING HORMONE; LOCUS-COERULEUS NEURONS; NERVOUS-SYSTEM ACTIVITY; CARDIAC VAGAL TONE; SALIVARY CORTISOL; NEUROVISCERAL INTEGRATION; METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES; SOCIOECONOMIC-STATUS; METABOLIC SYNDROME	Stress research in youth typically considers either the autonomic nervous system or HPA axis. However, these systems are highly coordinated and physically interconnected. We examined whether the interrelation between cardio-autonomic and HPA axis measures was better associated with perceived stress than their singular associations. Children and adolescents (N=201) collected saliva samples to measure cortisol (AUC(AG), AUC(I), maximum), wore an electrocardiogram monitor for 24 h to derive heart rate variability (HRV; LF, HF, LF/HF ratio), and completed the Perceived Stress Scale. The interaction between sympathovagal modulation (LF, LF/HF ratio) and cortisol awakening response (AUC(AG), AUC(I), maximum) explained significantly greater variance in perceived stress than either stress system alone. Higher sympathovagal modulation combined with higher cortisol awakening response was associated with greater perceived stress. Findings suggest that the inter-relation between cardio-autonomic and HPA axis activity may advance our understanding of how stress impacts health. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

They induce cytoskeletal rearrangements that are critical for the regulation of axon outgrowth and guidance. It is generally accepted that Rac1 and Cdc42 are positive regulators of axon outgrowth and guidance, whereas RhoA is a negative regulator. However, spatiotemporal control of their activity can modify the function of Rho GTPases during axonal morphogenesis. Signalling downstream of the axon guidance cue netrin-1 and its receptor deleted in colorectal cancer (DCC) triggers the activation of Rac1 and the inhibition of RhoA to promote axon outgrowth. However, our previous work also suggests that netrin-1/DCC signalling can activate RhoA in a time- and region-specific manner. ResultsHere, we visualised RhoA activation in response to netrin-1 in live embryonic cortical neurons using fluorescence resonance energy transfer. RhoA activity oscillated in unstimulated neurons and netrin-1 increased the amplitude of the oscillations in growth cones after 5min of stimulation. Within this period of time, netrin-1 transiently increased RhoA activity and modulated the pattern of RhoA oscillations. We found that the timing of netrin-1-induced RhoA activation was different in whole neurons, cell bodies and growth cones. ConclusionsWe conclude that netrin-1 modulates the spatiotemporal activation of RhoA in embryonic cortical neurons. SignificanceThis study demonstrates for the first time the short-term localised activation of RhoA in neuronal growth cones by the axon guidance cue netrin-1.

A typical approach to developing a process understanding is applying a combination of design of experiments with statistical data analysis. Hybrid semi-parametric modeling is investigated as an alternative method to pure statistical data analysis. The hybrid model framework provides flexibility to select model complexity based on available data and knowledge. Here, a parametric dynamic bioreactor model is integrated with a nonparametric artificial neural network that describes biomass and product formation rates as function of varied fed-batch fermentation conditions for high cell density heterologous protein production with E. coli. Our model can accurately describe biomass growth and product formation across variations in induction temperature, pH and feed rates. The model indicates that while product expression rate is a function of early induction phase conditions, it is negatively impacted as productivity increases. This could correspond with physiological changes due to cytoplasmic product accumulation. Due to the dynamic nature of the model, rational process timing decisions can be made and the impact of temporal variations in process parameters on product formation and process performance can be assessed, which is central for process understanding.

The striatum is also innervated by dopaminergic (DAergic) terminals, some of which release glutamate as a co-transmitter. Despite evidence for functional DA release at birth in the striatum, the role of DA in the establishment of striatal circuitry is unclear. In light of recent work suggesting activity-dependent homeostatic regulation of glutamatergic terminals on MSNs expressing the D2 DA receptor (D2-MSNs), we used primary co-cultures to test the hypothesis that stimulation of DA and glutamate receptors regulates the homeostasis of glutamatergic synapses on MSNs. Co-culture of D2-MSNs with mesencephalic DA neurons or with cortical neurons produced an increase in spines and functional glutamate synapses expressing VGLUT2 or VGLUT1, respectively. The density of VGLUT2-positive terminals was reduced by the conditional knockout of this gene from DA neurons. In the presence of both mesencephalic and cortical neurons, the density of synapses reached the same total, compatible with the possibility of a homeostatic mechanism capping excitatory synaptic density. Blockade of D2 receptors increased the density of cortical and mesencephalic glutamatergic terminals, without changing MSN spine density or mEPSC frequency. Combined blockade of AMPA and NMDA glutamate receptors increased the density of cortical terminals and decreased that of mesencephalic VGLUT2-positive terminals, with no net change in total excitatory terminal density or in mEPSC frequency. These results suggest that DA and glutamate signaling regulate excitatory inputs to striatal D2-MSNs at both the pre- and postsynaptic level, under the influence of a homeostatic mechanism controlling functional output of the circuit.

We included 10 patients undergoing combined surface-intracranial EEG with >= 10 spikes in the surface EEG during the first 30 consecutive minutes of N3 sleep. FRs (>= 4 consecutive oscillations above 250 Hz with an amplitude clearly exceeding that of the background) on the surface EEG (F3-C3, C3-P3, Fz-Cz, Cz-Pz, F4-C4, C4-P4) were visually marked, and verified by two EEG experts. FRs were categorized as related to the SOZ, if localized in the brain lobe of the SOZ. Low-amplitude FRs with a rate of 0.09/min were found in 6/10 patients: two exhibited events related to the SOZ, three showed no relationship with the SOZ, and in one patient the SOZ was not identified. It may be possible to detect FRs with surface EEG using subdermal electrodes in patients with focal epilepsy. The relationship between surface FRs and the SOZ remains unclear. Future studies aiming at a higher spatial EEG coverage are needed to elucidate their significance.

MethodsThe current study investigated the reliability and validity of AMC-26 with a sample of caregivers of children with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD; n=258) who completed AMC-26 as part of a larger study on parenting children with NDD. A subsample of children from the larger study (n=49) were assessed using standardized measures of cognitive and adaptive functioning. ResultsFactor analysis revealed that a four-component model explained 51.12% of the variance. Cronbach's alpha was calculated for each of the four factors and for the scale as a whole, and ranged from 0.75 to 0.85, suggesting a high level of internal consistency. Construct validity was tested through comparisons with the results of standardized measures of child functioning. Predicted relationships for factors one, two and three were statistically significant and in the expected directions. Predictions for factor four were partially supported. AMC-26 was also expected to serve as an indicator of caregiver distress. Drawing on a sample of caregivers from the larger study (n=251) the model was found to be significant and explained 23% of the variance in caregiver depressive symptoms (R-2=.053, F (1, 249)=14.06, P<.001). ConclusionsBased on these observations, the authors contend that AMC-26 may be used by clinicians and researchers as a tool to capture child function and child health complexity. Such a measure may help elucidate the relationships between child complexity and family well-being. This is an important avenue for further investigation.	[Ritzema, A.

Development of additional pituitary hormone deficiencies in pediatric patients originally diagnosed with isolated growth hormone deficiency due to organic causes	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF ENDOCRINOLOGY			English	Article							ISOLATED GH DEFICIENCY; TERM-FOLLOW-UP; SHORT STATURE; CENTRAL HYPOTHYROIDISM; HYPOPITUITARY PATIENTS; UNITED-STATES; THYROID AXIS; CHILDREN; CHILDHOOD; REPLACEMENT	Objective: To determine characteristics of children initially diagnosed with isolated growth hormone deficiency (IGHD) of organic aetiology, who later developed multiple pituitary hormone deficiencies (MPHD). Design: Data were analysed for 716 growth hormone-treated children with organic IGHD, who were growth hormone-naive at baseline in the multinational, observational Genetics and Neuroendocrinology of Short Stature International Study. Methods: Development of MPHD was ascertained from investigator-provided diagnoses, adverse events and concomitant medications. Analyses were performed for all patients and separately for those who developed MPHD within 4.5 years or had >3.5 years follow-up and continued to have IGHD (4-year cohort). Results: MPHD developed in 71/716 (9.9%) children overall, and in 60/290 (20.7%) in the 4-year cohort. The most frequent additional deficiencies were thyroid-stimulating hormone (47 patients) and gonadotropins (23 patients). Compared with those who remained with IGHD, children who developed MPHD had more severe GHD at study entry, significantly lower baseline insulin-like growth factor1, peak stimulated growth hormone, and more frequent diagnosis of intracranial tumour or mutation of gene(s) controlling hypothalamic-pituitary development and/or function. Multivariate logistic regression analyses identified female gender, longer follow-up, higher baseline age and lower peak stimulated growth hormone as predictors of MPHD development. Conclusions: MPHD is more likely to develop in patients with severe organic IGHD, especially those with history of intracranial tumour or mutation of gene(s) controlling hypothalamic-pituitary development and/or function. Older baseline age, female gender and longer follow-up duration were also associated with higher incidence of MPHD. Long-term monitoring of pituitary function is recommended, irrespective of the aetiology of GHD.

At that time, little evidence regarding epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnostic workup, treatment strategies, and follow-up was available. Consequently, the criteria for the clinical entities were more experience based than evidence based. In the past decade, new in-sights have been gained about the different functional gastrointestinal intestinal disorders in these age groups. Based on those, further revisions have been made to the criteria. The description of infant colic has been expanded to include criteria for the general pediatrician and specific criteria for researchers. The greatest change was the addition of a paragraph regarding the neurobiology of pain in infants and toddlers, including the understanding of the neurodevelopment of nociception and of the wide array of factors that can impact the pain experience.

Virtual simulators offer anatomical definition but lack adequate tactile feedback. Animal models, which provide more lifelike training, require an appropriate infrastructure base. The authors describe a training model for neurointerventional procedures using the human placenta (HP), which affords haptic training with significantly fewer resource requirements, and discuss its validation. METHODS Twelve HPs were prepared for simulated endovascular procedures. Training exercises performed by interventional neuroradiologists and novice fellows were placental angiography, stent placement, aneurysm coiling, and intravascular liquid embolic agent injection. RESULTS The endovascular training exercises proposed can be easily reproduced in the HP. Face, content, and construct validity were assessed by 6 neurointerventional radiologists and 6 novice fellows in interventional radiology. CONCLUSIONS The use of HP provides an inexpensive training model for the training of neurointerventionalists. Preliminary validation results show that this simulation model has face and content validity and has demonstrated construct validity for the interventions assessed in this study.

The most common rhythms leading to SCD are ventricular tachycardia (VT) or ventricular fibrillation (VF). These result from an accelerated ventricular pacemaker or ventricular reentrant waves. Despite significant efforts to develop accurate predictors for the risk of SCD, current methods for risk stratification still need to be improved. In this article we briefly review current approaches to risk stratification. Then we discuss the mathematical basis for dynamical transitions (called bifurcations) that may lead to VT and VF. One mechanism for transition to VT or VF involves a perturbation by a premature ventricular complex (PVC) during sinus rhythm. We describe the main mechanisms of PVCs (reentry, independent pacemakers and abnormal depolarizations). An emerging approach to risk stratification for SCD involves the development of individualized dynamical models of a patient based on measured anatomy and physiology. Careful analysis and modelling of dynamics of ventricular arrhythmia on an individual basis will be essential in order to improve risk stratification for SCD and to lay a foundation for personalized (precision) medicine in cardiology.

Investigating their roles has led to the creation of vesicular monoaminergic transporter-2 (VMAT2) knockout (KO) mice. While this mutation results in postnatal death, VMAT2-heterozygous (HET) mice are viable and show a complex behavioural phenotype. However, the simultaneous alteration of the 3 systems prevents investigations into their individual functions. Methods To assess the specific role of NE, 5-HT and DA, we genetically disrupted their neurotransmission by creating conditional VMAT2-KO mice with targeted recombination. These specific recombinations were obtained by breeding VMAT2(lox/lox) mice with DBHcre, SERTcre and DATcre mice, respectively. We conducted a complete neurochemical and behavioural characterization of VMAT2-HET animals in each system. Results Conditional VMAT2-KO mice revealed an absence of VMAT2 expression, and a specific decrease in the whole brain levels of each monoamine. Although NE- and 5-HT-depleted mice are viable into adulthood, DA depletion results in postnatal death before weaning. Interestingly, alteration of the DA transmission fully accounted for the increased amphetamine response formerly observed in the VMAT2-HET mice, whereas alteration of the 5-HT system was solely responsible for the increase in cocaine response. Limitations We used VMAT2-HET mice that displayed a mild phenotype. Because the VMAT2-KO in DA neurons is lethal, it precluded a straightforward comparison of the full KOs in the 3 systems. Conclusion Given the intermingled functions of NE, 5-HT and DA in regulating cognitive and affective functions, this model will enhance understanding of their respective roles in the pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders.

Prompted by a genome-wide association meta-analysis implicating the Ras-specific guanine nucleotide-releasing factor 2 (RASGRF2) gene in the regulation of alcohol intake in men, we have recently shown that male Rasgrf2(-/-) mice exhibit reduced ethanol intake and preference accompanied by a perturbed mesolimbic dopamine system. We therefore propose that these mice represent a valid model to further elucidate the precise genes and mechanisms regulating mesolimbic dopamine functioning. Methods Transcriptomic data from the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) of male Rasgrf2(-/-) mice and wild-type controls were analyzed by weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA). We performed follow-up genetic association tests in humans using a sample of male adolescents from the IMAGEN study characterized for binge drinking (n = 905) and ventral striatal activation during an fMRI reward task (n = 608). Results The WGCNA analyses using accumbal transcriptomic data revealed 37 distinct modules, or functionally related groups of genes. Two of these modules were significantly associated with Rasgrf2 knockout status: M5 (p < 0.001) and M6 (p < 0.001). In follow-up translational analyses we found that human orthologues for the M5 module were significantly (p < 0.01) enriched with genetic association signals for binge drinking in male adolescents. Furthermore, the most significant locus, originating from the EH-domain containing 4 (EHD4) gene (p < 0.001), was also significantly associated with altered ventral striatal activity in male adolescents performing an fMRI reward task (p(empirical) < 0.001). Limitations It was not possible to determine the extent to which the M5 module was dysregulated in Rasgrf2(-/-) mice by perturbed mesolimbic dopamine signalling or by the loss of Rasgrf2 function in the NAcc. Conclusion Taken together, our findings indicate that the accumbal M5 module, initially identified as being dysregulated in male Rasgrf2(-/-) mice, is also relevant for human alcohol-related phenotypes potentially through the modulation of reinforcement mechanisms in the NAcc. We therefore propose that the genes comprising this module represent important candidates for further elucidation within the context of alcohol-related phenotypes.

Identifying predictors of long-term outcome in pulmonary arterial hypertension is important to assess disease severity and guide treatment. We investigate associations between efficacy parameters and long-term outcomes in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension receiving riociguat in the PATENT-2 study. We also present safety and efficacy data from the final data cutoff of PATENT-2, where most patients had received at least 2 years of riociguat treatment. Methods Eligible patients from the PATENT-1 study entered the PATENT-2 open-label extension, which will continue until all patients transition to the commercial drug. All patients received riociguat individually adjusted to a maximum dose of 2.5 mg three times a day. The primary endpoint was safety and tolerability, assessed with recording adverse events, serious adverse events, discontinuations, and deaths; exploratory assessments included 6-min walking distance (6MWD), WHO functional class, N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) concentrations, Borg dyspnoea score, health-related quality of life (EQ-5D score), survival, and clinical worsening-free survival. Association between efficacy parameters and long-term outcomes was assessed using Kaplan-Meier analyses and a Cox proportional-hazards regression model. PATENT-2 is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00863681. Findings 396 patients entered PATENT-2, of whom 197 patients were receiving riociguat monotherapy and 199 were receiving riociguat in combination with endothelin receptor antagonists or prostanoids, or both. A significant association was noted between 6MWD, NT-proBNP concentration, and WHO functional class and overall survival at baseline (p=0.0006, 0.0225, and 0.0191, respectively), and at follow-up (p=0.021, 0.0056, and 0.0048, respectively). Riociguat was well tolerated in PATENT-2. Serious adverse events were recorded in 238 (60%) of the total population, and 45 (11%) patients discontinued treatment because of an adverse event. Improvements in 6MWD, WHO functional class, and NT-proBNP concentrations were maintained after 2 years of treatment. Interpretation These results support the long-term use of riociguat in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension, and emphasise the prognostic value of 6MWD, WHO functional class, and NT-proBNP concentrations.

Most genes with truncating mutations are implicated in NSC proliferation and differentiation (e.g., MBD5, CDKL5, and MECP2). Similarly, reciprocal deletion/duplication copy-number variants (CNVs), such as 1q21.1 and 16p11.2, are inversely correlated with head size. In addition, pathways such as MAPK, mTOR, and RAS, which are important in cancer, a disease of uncontrolled cell proliferation, are implicated in NDDs. These deficits are a measurable output of patient-derived induced neural progenitor cells, and may represent a diagnostic tool and a possible clinical intervention point for molecular therapies, irrespective of genotype.

MS patients switch from a relapsing-remitting to a progressive disease course, but it is not understood why and how this conversion occurs and why some patients never experience disease progression. Do aging and accumulation of neuronal damage induce progression, or do cognitive symptoms and accelerated grey matter (GM) atrophy point to distinct processes affecting networks? This review weighs accepted dogma against real data on the secondary progressive phase of the disease, highlighting current challenges in this important field and directions towards development of treatment strategies to slow or prevent progression of disability.

Pediat Emergency Res Canada PERC	Scalp Hematoma Characteristics Associated With Intracranial Injury in Pediatric Minor Head Injury	ACADEMIC EMERGENCY MEDICINE			English	Article							CLINICAL DECISION RULES; OF-CARE ULTRASOUND; COMPUTED-TOMOGRAPHY; CHILDREN YOUNGER; LOGISTIC-REGRESSION; BRAIN-INJURIES; TRAUMA; PREDICTION; INFANTS; RISK	Objectives: Minor head trauma accounts for a significant proportion of pediatric emergency department (ED) visits. In children younger than 24 months, scalp hematomas are thought to be associated with the presence of intracranial injury (ICI). We investigated which scalp hematoma characteristics were associated with increased odds of ICI in children less than 17 years who presented to the ED following minor head injury and whether an underlying linear skull fracture may explain this relationship. Methods: This was a secondary analysis of 3,866 patients enrolled in the Canadian Assessment of Tomography of Childhood Head Injury (CATCH) study. Information about scalp hematoma presence (yes/no), location (frontal, temporal/parietal, occipital), and size (small and localized, large and boggy) was collected by emergency physicians using a structured data collection form. ICI was defined as the presence of an acute brain lesion on computed tomography. Logistic regression analyses were adjusted for age, sex, dangerous injury mechanism, irritability on examination, suspected open or depressed skull fracture, and clinical signs of basal skull fracture. Results: ICI was present in 159 (4.1%) patients. The presence of a scalp hematoma (n = 1,189) in any location was associated with significantly greater odds of ICI (odds ratio [OR] = 4.4, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 3.06 to 6.02), particularly for those located in temporal/parietal (OR = 6.0, 95% CI = 3.9 to 9.3) and occipital regions (OR = 5.6, 95% CI = 3.5 to 8.9). Both small and localized and large and boggy hematomas were significantly associated with ICI, although larger hematomas conferred larger odds (OR = 9.9, 95% CI = 6.3 to 15.5). Although the presence of a scalp hematoma was associated with greater odds of ICI in all age groups, odds were greatest in children aged 0 to 6 months (OR = 13.5, 95% CI = 1.5 to 119.3). Linear skull fractures were present in 156 (4.0%) patients. Of the 111 patients with scalp hematoma and ICI, 57 (51%) patients had a linear skull fracture and 54 (49%) did not. The association between scalp hematoma and ICI attenuated but remained significant after excluding patients with linear skull fracture (OR = 3.3, 95% CI = 2.1 to 5.1). Conclusions: Large and boggy and nonfrontal scalp hematomas had the strongest association with the presence of ICI in this large pediatric cohort. Although children 0 to 6 months of age were at highest odds, the presence of a scalp hematoma also independently increased the odds of ICI in older children and adolescents. The presence of a linear skull fracture only partially explained this relation, indicating that ruling out a skull fracture beneath a hematoma does not obviate the risk of intracranial pathology.

Testing the Implicit and Explicit Cognitions Underlying Behavioral Inhibition System-Related Drinking in Young Adults	ALCOHOLISM-CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Behavioral Inhibition System; Behavioral Approach System; Alcohol Use; Cognition	REINFORCEMENT SENSITIVITY THEORY; ACQUIRED PREPAREDNESS MODEL; ALCOHOL-RELATED COGNITIONS; IDENTIFICATION TEST; COLLEGE-STUDENTS; SOCIAL COGNITION; DRINKERS; PERSONALITY; RESPONSES; ANXIETY	BackgroundThere is great interest in the role of the behavioral inhibition system (BIS) and the behavioral approach system (BAS) in the etiology of alcohol use because of the strong links of these systems to neuroscience and cognitive models of addiction. The revised Reinforcement Sensitivity Theory suggests that the strength of the BIS and BAS jointly influences behavior, so-called the joint systems hypothesis. Yet, relatively little work has examined this hypothesis, particularly with respect to alcohol information processing. Grounded in dual-process theories of alcohol information processing, this study aimed to clarify the roles of implicit (i.e., automatic processes) and explicit (i.e., controlled processes) cognitions in BIS-related drinking. When anxious and presented with an alcohol (vs. neutral) cue, we expected those with an elevated BIS to have increased implicit and explicit alcohol cognitions related to tension reduction, but only at elevated BAS. Shifts in cognitions following cue exposure were expected to positively correlate with alcohol misuse. MethodsStudents (N=110) completed baseline measures followed by the Trier Social Stress Test. This was followed by a cue exposure (random assignment to alcohol or water cue), during which participants completed postmood assessments of implicit/explicit alcohol cognitions. ResultsOverall, participants' implicit alcohol cognition was negative. The effect of BIS on implicit and explicit cognitions was moderated by BAS; however, results were not as hypothesized. In the alcohol condition only (when controlling for baseline implicit cognition), BIS predicted relatively weak implicit negative alcohol cognition, but only at low BAS. Interestingly, in the alcohol condition only, BIS predicted increased explicit reward (but not relief) expectancies, but only at high BAS. Changes in explicit reward expectancies positively correlated with alcohol misuse. ConclusionsOur results suggest that explicit cognitions may be relevant to drinking among anxious individuals who are also reward responsive. Cognitive behavioral interventions should target reward expectancies to reduce anxiety-related drinking.

In the present study, we aimed to further understand the mechanisms of suicidal vulnerability in the elderly, focusing on high-risk decision-making. This trait-like impairment has been extensively studied in adolescent and middle-aged suicide attempters, but less often in older persons. Design: Case-control study. Setting: Community and university hospital. Participants: All participants were aged 65 and older. Thirty-five persons with a lifetime history of suicide attempts and depressive disorder were compared with 52 individuals with a past history of depressive disorder but no history suicidal acts, and 43 healthy comparison subjects. Measurements: The Iowa Gambling Task was used as a measure of value-based decision-making. Results: Taking into account age, sex, and Beck depression scores, no difference in decision-making performance was found between the three groups. The group of suicide attempters exhibited a significant heterogeneity, however, with those using violent means performing worse than non-violent attempters. Conclusions: This study does not confirm the hypothesis of a significant role for poor Iowa Gambling Task performance as a general marker of suicidal behavior among the elderly but highlights its association with the specific subtype of violent suicidal attempters. Combined with previous findings among other age groups, it suggests that Iowa Gambling Task impairment may be a risk marker of vulnerability to violent suicidal acts.

Simulation and Regionalization of Daily Global Solar Radiation: A Case Study in Quebec, Canada	ATMOSPHERE-OCEAN			English	Article						global solar radiation; regionalization; stochastic model; temperature; relative humidity	ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; SUNSHINE DURATION; MINIMUM TEMPERATURE; DAILY MAXIMUM; MODELS; IRRADIANCE; SURFACE; RANGE	Global solar radiation (GSR) is essential for agricultural and plant growth modelling, air and water heating analyses, and solar electric power systems. However, GSR gauging stations are scarce compared with stations for monitoring common meteorological variables such as air temperature and relative humidity. In this study, one power function, three linear regression, and three non-linear models based on an artificial neural network (ANN) are developed to extend short records of daily GSR for meteorological stations where predictors (i.e., temperature and/or relative humidity) are available. The seven models are then applied to 19 meteorological stations located across the province of Quebec (Canada). On average, the root-mean-square errors (RMSEs) for ANN-based models are 0.33-0.54 MJ m(-2) d(-1) smaller than those for the power function and linear regression models for the same input variables, indicating that the non-linear ANN-based models are more efficient in simulating daily GSR. Regionalization potential of the seven models is also evaluated for ungauged stations where predictors are available. The power function and the three linear regression models are tested by interpolating spatially correlated at-site coefficients using universal kriging or by applying a leave-one-out calibration procedure for spatially uncorrelated at-site coefficients. Regional ANN-based models are also developed by training the model based on the leave-one-out procedure. The RMSEs for regional ANN models are 0.08-0.46 MJ m(-2) d(-1) smaller than for other models using the same input conditions. However, the regional ANN-based models are more sensitive to new station input values compared with the other models. Maps of interpolated coefficients and regional equations of the power function and the linear regression models are provided for direct application to the study area.	[Jeong, D.

Role of exercise in the treatment of alcohol use disorders	BIOMEDICAL REPORTS			English	Review						alcoholism; exercise training; beta-endorphin; opioids; brain; ethanol	BETA-ENDORPHIN INFUSION; AEROBIC EXERCISE; TREADMILL EXERCISE; PHYSICAL-EXERCISE; BASAL GANGLIA; MENTAL-HEALTH; PLASMA-LEVELS; DEPRESSION; DEPENDENCE; INTENSITY	Excessive alcohol use can cause harmful effects on the human body, which are associated with serious health problems, and it can also lead to the development of alcohol use disorders (AUDs). There is certain evidence that physical exercise positively affects excessive alcohol use and the associated problems by leading to reduced alcohol intake. A literature search was conducted using the databases PubMed, Medline and Web of Science. The search terms used as keywords were: Addiction, abuse, alcohol use disorders, exercise training, beta-endorphin, opioids, brain, ethanol and alcohol. The current study presents the studies that reported on the use of exercise in the treatment of AUDs between 1970 and 2015. The potential psychological and physiological mechanisms that contribute to the action of exercise were also reviewed, highlighting the role of beta-endorphin and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in AUDs and the possible association among physical activity, the endogenous opioid system and the desire for alcohol. Only 11 studies were identified that refer to the effect of exercise on alcohol consumption and/ or the associated outcomes. Six of those studies concluded that exercise may have a positive impact towards alcohol consumption, abstinence rates or the urge to drink. One of those studies also indicated that a bout of exercise affects the endogenous opioids, which may be associated with the urge to drink. Another 3 studies indicated that responses to acute exercise in individuals with AUDs are different compared to those in healthy ones. Generally, despite limited research data and often contradictory results, there is certain early promising evidence for the role of exercise as an adjunctive tool in the treatment of AUDs. Physiological and biochemical parameters that would confirm that exercise is safe for individuals with AUDs should be examined in future studies.

Each heartbeat indeed imposes a pulsatile pressure that generates a vascular stretch. Lifetime accumulation of pulsatile stretches will eventually induce fatigue of the elastic large arterial walls, such as aortic and carotid artery walls, promoting their stiffening that will gradually perturb the normal blood flow and local pressure within the organs, and lead to organ failure. The augmented pulse pressure induced by arterial stiffening favours left ventricular hypertrophy because of the repeated extra work against stiff high-pressure arteries, and tissue damage as a result of excessive pulsatile pressure transmitted into the microcirculation, especially in low resistance/high-flow organs such as the brain and kidneys. Vascular aging is therefore characterized by the stiffening of large elastic arteries leading to a gradual increase in pulse pressure with age. In this review we focus on the effect of age-related stiffening of large elastic arteries. We report the clinical evidence linking arterial stiffness and organ failure and discuss the molecular pathways that are activated by the increase of mechanical stress in the wall. We also discuss the possible interventions that could limit arterial stiffening with age, such as regular aerobic exercise training, and some pharmacological approaches.

We previously validated the Maximum Entropy on the Mean (MEM) as a source localization able to recover the spatial extent of the epileptic spike generators. The purpose of this study was to evaluate quantitatively, using intracranial EEG (iEEG), the spatial extent recovered from MEG sources by estimating iEEG potentials generated by these MEG sources. We evaluated five patients with focal epilepsy who had a pre-operative MEG acquisition and iEEG with MRI-compatible electrodes. Individual MEG epileptic spikes were localized along the cortical surface segmented from a pre-operative MRI, which was co-registered with the MRI obtained with iEEG electrodes in place for identification of iEEG contacts. An iEEG forward model estimated the influence of every dipolar source of the cortical surface on each iEEG contact. This iEEG forward model was applied to MEG sources to estimate iEEG potentials that would have been generated by these sources. MEG-estimated iEEG potentials were compared with measured iEEG potentials using four source localization methods: two variants of MEM and two standard methods equivalent to minimum norm and LORETA estimates. Our results demonstrated an excellent MEG/iEEG correspondence in the presumed focus for four out of five patients. In one patient, the deep generator identified in iEEG could not be localized in MEG. MEG-estimated iEEG potentials is a promising method to evaluate which MEG sources could be retrieved and validated with iEEG data, providing accurate results especially when applied to MEM localizations.

To obtain this property, network connections are provided with orientation and with flexible redundancy carried by both spatial and temporal redundancies, a mechanism of anticipation being introduced in the model. In addition to the sequence storage with high efficiency, this new scheme also offers biological plausibility. In order to achieve accurate sequence retrieval, a double-layered structure combining heteroassociation and autoassociation is also proposed.

We also sought to evaluate the effect of time since injury and number of injuries on heart rate variability (HRV). We hypothesized that physical exertion would reveal persisting modifications in HRV following a concussion. We included, in a cross-sectional design, athletes who sustained a concussion and matched controls. Concussions were identified by a medical doctor using established criteria. Twelve male concussed and 12 control athletes took part in the study. Control participants were teammates who were chosen to match the concussed athletes with regard to their height, weight, education, and age. The beat-to-beat electrocardiogram intervals of the participants were measured at rest and during physical exertion (isometric hand grip contraction; IHGC), which was sustained for 3 minutes at 30% of the participants' maximum. Linear and nonlinear parameters of HRV were calculated. The ratio between low and high frequency (LF/HF) bands was calculated to assess the sympathovagal balance. During the IHGC, but not at rest, concussed athletes presented significantly lower power in HF bands, leading to a significantly higher LF/HF ratio (p <= 0.05). Thus, asymptomatic athletes still may exhibit modifications in cardiac autonomic modulation weeks to months following injury. These modifications may only become apparent during physical exertion. Monitoring HRV may aid diagnosis and provide insight about safe return to play.

We aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of afatinib and gefitinib in this setting. Methods This multicentre, international, open-label, exploratory, randomised controlled phase 2B trial (LUX-Lung 7) was done at 64 centres in 13 countries. Treatment-naive patients with stage IIIB or IV NSCLC and a common EGFR mutation (exon 19 deletion or Leu858Arg) were randomly assigned (1: 1) to receive afatinib (40 mg per day) or gefitinib (250 mg per day) until disease progression, or beyond if deemed beneficial by the investigator. Randomisation, stratified by EGFR mutation type and status of brain metastases, was done centrally using a validated number generating system implemented via an interactive voice or web-based response system with a block size of four. Clinicians and patients were not masked to treatment allocation; independent review of tumour response was done in a blinded manner. Coprimary endpoints were progression-free survival by independent central review, time-to-treatment failure, and overall survival. Efficacy analyses were done in the intention-to-treat population and safety analyses were done in patients who received at least one dose of study drug. This ongoing study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01466660. Findings Between Dec 13, 2011, and Aug 8, 2013, 319 patients were randomly assigned (160 to afatinib and 159 to gefitinib). Median follow-up was 27.3 months (IQR 15.3-33.9). Progression-free survival (median 11.0 months [95% CI 1.6-12.9] with afatinib vs 1.9 months [9.1-11.5] with gefitinib; hazard ratio [HR] .73 [95% CI .57-.95], p=.017) and time-to-treatment failure (median 13.7 months [95% CI 11.9-15.0] with afatinib vs 11.5 months [1.1-13.1] with gefitinib; HR .73 [95% CI .58-.92], p=.0073) were significantly longer with afatinib than with gefitinib. Overall survival data are not mature. The most common treatment-related grade 3 or 4 adverse events were diarrhoea (20 [13%] of 160 patients given afatinib vs two [1%] of 159 given gefitinib) and rash or acne (15 [9%] patients given afatinib vs five [3%] of those given gefitinib) and liver enzyme elevations (no patients given afatinib vs 14 [9%] of those given gefitinib). Serious treatment-related adverse events occurred in 17 (11%) patients in the afatinib group and seven (4%) in the gefitinib group. Ten (6%) patients in each group discontinued treatment due to drug-related adverse events. 15 (9%) fatal adverse events occurred in the afatinib group and ten (6%) in the gefitinib group. All but one of these deaths were considered unrelated to treatment; one patient in the gefitinib group died from drug-related hepatic and renal failure. Interpretation Afatinib significantly improved outcomes in treatment-naive patients with EGFR-mutated NSCLC compared with gefitinib, with a manageable tolerability profile. These data are potentially important for clinical decision making in this patient population.

Results: Compared to controls, pediatric-onset MS patients demonstrated higher FC of the precuneus, particularly with the anterior cingulate cortex (z=4.21, p<.001), frontal medial cortex (z=3.48, p<.001), and cerebellum (z=3.72, p<.001). Greater T-2 lesion volume and lower normalized thalamic volume were associated with reduced FC of the thalamus, especially for FC with the right superior occipital region (t=-2.87, p=.0123 and t=2.27, p=.04 respectively). FC of the left frontal medial cortex was negatively correlated with composite cognitive z-score in the pediatric-onset MS group (p<.05). Conclusions: Greater resting-state FC between posterior and anterior brain regions is present in pediatric-onset MS. With greater disease-related structural pathology, there is a disruption of thalamo-cortical FC. In the absence of actual cognitive impairment, heightened FC of the frontal medial cortex was associated with lower cognitive performance, suggesting that greater functional resources are recruited during resting-state in patients with reduced cognitive efficiency.

Plasticity within non-cerebellar pathways rapidly shapes motor performance in vivo	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							HORIZONTAL VESTIBULOOCULAR REFLEX; MULTICHANNEL VESTIBULAR PROSTHESIS; TERM SYNAPTIC DEPRESSION; BRAIN-STEM NEURONS; UNILATERAL LABYRINTHECTOMY; BIDIRECTIONAL PLASTICITY; CONTRALATERAL LABYRINTH; MULTIMODAL INTEGRATION; ELECTRICAL-STIMULATION; NERVE AFFERENTS	Although cerebellar mechanisms are vital to maintain accuracy during complex movements and to calibrate simple reflexes, recent in vitro studies have called into question the widely held view that synaptic changes within cerebellar pathways exclusively guide alterations in motor performance. Here we investigate the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) circuitry by applying temporally precise activation of vestibular afferents in awake-behaving monkeys to link plasticity at different neural sites with changes in motor performance. Behaviourally relevant activation patterns produce rapid attenuation of direct pathway VOR neurons, but not their nerve input. Changes in the strength of this pathway are sufficient to induce a lasting decrease in the evoked VOR. In addition, indirect brainstem pathways display complementary nearly instantaneous changes, contributing to compensating for the reduced sensitivity of primary VOR neurons. Taken together, our data provide evidence that multiple sites of plasticity within VOR pathways can rapidly shape motor performance in vivo.

From the moment patients come into contact with the health care system, their entire medical history is recorded electronically. Whether a patient is in the operating room or on the hospital ward, technological advancement has facilitated the expedient and reliable measurement of clinically relevant health metrics, all in an effort to guide care and ensure the best possible clinical outcomes. However, as the volume and complexity of biomedical data grow, it becomes challenging to effectively process "big data" using conventional techniques. Physicians and scientists must be prepared to look beyond classic methods of data processing to extract clinically relevant information. The purpose of this article is to introduce the modern plastic surgeon to machine learning and computational interpretation of large data sets. What is machine learning? Machine learning, a subfield of artificial intelligence, can address clinically relevant problems in several domains of plastic surgery, including burn surgery; microsurgery; and craniofacial, peripheral nerve, and aesthetic surgery. This article provides a brief introduction to current research and suggests future projects that will allow plastic surgeons to explore this new frontier of surgical science.

INTERACT2 Investigators	Significance of Hematoma Shape and Density in Intracerebral Hemorrhage The Intensive Blood Pressure Reduction in Acute Intracerebral Hemorrhage Trial Study	STROKE			English	Article						blood pressure; brain imaging; cerebral hemorrhage; hypertension; stroke	COMPUTED-TOMOGRAPHY; GROWTH; ENLARGEMENT; PREDICTORS; MORTALITY; OUTCOMES	Background and Purpose-In patients with acute intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), the shape and density of the hematoma are associated with its subsequent growth, but the impact of these parameters on clinical outcome is uncertain. Methods-Baseline computed tomographic scans and clinical data were obtained in the Intensive Blood Pressure Reduction in Acute Intracerebral Hemorrhage Trial (INTERACT2). Three independent neurologists blind to clinical data assessed ICH for shape and density using a previously described scale. Shape was defined as irregular when the ICH had >= 2 extra lesions added to the ellipsoid-shaped ICH. Density was heterogeneous when there were >= 3 low-density lesions within the ICH. Outcome measures were death and major disability (modified Rankin scale score of 3-5), combined and separate at 90-day postrandomization. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to determine the significance of hematoma characteristics on outcome. Results-There were 2066 patient computed tomographic scans included in the analysis, with 46% and 38% having irregular and heterogeneous ICH, respectively. Irregular shape was independently associated with death/major disability (adjusted odds ratio, 1.60; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.29-1.98) and major disability alone (adjusted odds ratio, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.31-1.95), but not with death alone (adjusted odds ratio, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.68-1.39). Heterogeneous density was not associated with clinical outcomes (adjusted odds ratio, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.85-1.33), 1.04 (95% CI, 0.73-1.48), and 1.14 (95% CI, 0.93-1.39), respectively, for death/major disability, death alone, and disability alone). Conclusions-Irregular shape, but not heterogeneous density, is independently associated with poor outcome after ICH.

J	de Pasquale, JF; Poirier, P				de Pasquale, Jean-Frederic; Poirier, Pierre			Convolution and modal representations in Thagard and Stewart's neural theory of creativity: a critical analysis	SYNTHESE			English	Article						Creativity; Neural network; Semantic pointer; Modal representation; Holographic reduced representation; Vector symbolic architecture	BINDING; NETWORKS; EMOTION; MODEL; GENERATION; HYPOTHESIS; MECHANISMS; SYSTEMS; MEMORY	According to Thagard and Stewart (Cogn Sci 35(1):1-33, 2011), creativity results from the combination of neural representations (an idea which Thagard calls 'the combinatorial conjecture'), and combination results from convolution, an operation on vectors defined in the holographic reduced representation (HRR) framework (Plate, Holographic reduced representation: distributed representation for cognitive structures, 2003). They use these ideas to understand creativity as it occurs in many domains, and in particular in science. We argue that, because of its algebraic properties, convolution alone is ill-suited to the role proposed by Thagard and Stewart. The semantic pointer concept (Eliasmith, How to build a brain, 2013) allows us to see how we can apply the full range of HRR operations while keeping the modal representations so central to Thagard and Stewart's theory. By adding another combination operation and using semantic pointers as the combinatorial basis, this modified version overcomes the limitations of the original theory and perhaps helps us explain aspects of creativity not covered by the original theory. While a priori reasons cast doubts on the use of HRR operations with modal representations (Fisher et al., Appl Opt 26(23):5039-5054, 1987) such as semantic pointers, recent models point in the other direction, allowing us to be optimistic about the success of the revised version.

Prolonged controlled mechanical ventilation in humans triggers myofibrillar contractile dysfunction and myofilament protein loss in the diaphragm	THORAX			English	Article							INDUCED LUNG INJURY; RAT DIAPHRAGM; MUSCLE-FIBERS; FORCE; TITIN; ATROPHY; DISUSE; PROTEOLYSIS; CYTOKINES; KINETICS	Background Prolonged controlled mechanical ventilation (CMV) in humans and experimental animals results in diaphragm fibre atrophy and injury. In animals, prolonged CMV also triggers significant declines in diaphragm myofibril contractility. In humans, the impact of prolonged CMV on myofibril contractility remains unknown. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of prolonged CMV on active and passive human diaphragm myofibrillar force generation and myofilament protein levels. Methods and results Diaphragm biopsies were obtained from 13 subjects undergoing cardiac surgery (control group) and 12 brain-dead organ donors (CMV group). Subjects in each group had been mechanically ventilated for 2-4 and 12-74 h, respectively. Specific force generation of diaphragm myofibrils was measured with atomic force cantilevers. Rates of force development (K-act), force redevelopment after a shortening protocol (K-tr) and relaxation (K-rel) in fully activated myofibrils (pCa(2+)=4.5) were calculated to assess myosin cross-bridge kinetics. Myofilament protein levels were measured with immunoblotting and specific antibodies. Prolonged CMV significantly decreased active and passive diaphragm myofibrillar force generation, K-act, K-tr and K-rel. Myosin heavy chain (slow), troponin-C, troponin-I, troponin-T, tropomyosin and titin protein levels significantly decreased in response to prolonged CMV, but no effects on alpha-actin, alpha-actinin or nebulin levels were observed. Conclusions Prolonged CMV in humans triggers significant decreases in active and passive diaphragm myofibrillar force generation. This response is mediated, in part, by impaired myosin cross-bridge kinetics and decreased myofibrillar protein levels.

Design: ICU pharmacy database analgesic delivery audits from five countries. A 31-question analgesic agent survey was constructed, validated, and e-distributed in four countries. Setting: International multicenter neuro-ICU database audit and electronic survey. Patients: Six ICUs provided individual, anonymized analgesic delivery data in primary neurological diagnosis patients. Prescriber surveys were disseminated by neurocritical care societies. Interventions: None. Measurements and Main Results: Analgesic delivery data from 173 patients in French, Canadian, American, and Australian and New Zealand ICUs suggest that acetaminophen/paracetamol is the most common first-line analgesic (49.1% of patients); opiates are the "second line" in 31.5% of patients; however, 33% patients received no second agent. In the 2.3% with demyelinating disease, gabapentin was the most likely second analgesic (50.0%). Third-line analgesics were scarce across sites and neuropathologies. Few national or regional differences were found. The analgesic preference rankings noted by the 95 international physicians who completed the survey matched the audits. However, self-reported analgesic prescription rates were much higher than pharmacy records indicate, with self reported prescribing of both acetaminophen/paracetamol and opiates in 97% of patients and gabapentin in 45% of patients. Third-line analgesic variability appeared to be driven by neuropathology; ibuprofen was preferred for traumatic brain injury, postcraniotomy, and thromboembolic stroke patients, whereas gabapentin/pregabalin were favored in subarachnoid hemorrhage, intracranial hemorrhage, spine, demyelinating disease, and epileptic patients. Conclusions: Opiates and acetaminophen are preferred analgesic agents, and gabapentin is a contextual third choice, in neurocritically ill patients. Other agents are rarely prescribed. The discordance in physician self-reports and objective audits suggest that pain management optimization studies are warranted.

To date, most of these studies have consisted of simply detecting a difference in structural or functional images with little concern for their lack of biological specificity. Recent reviews and public debates have stressed the need for advanced imaging techniques to gain a better understanding of the nature of these differences - characterizing their extent in time and space, their underlying biological and network dynamics. The purpose of this article is to give an overview of advanced imaging techniques for an audience of cognitive neuroscientists that can assist them in the design and interpretation of future MRI studies of neuroplasticity. The review encompasses MRI methods that probe the morphology, microstructure, function, and connectivity of the brain with improved specificity. We underline the possible physiological underpinnings of these techniques and their recent applications within the framework of learning-and experience-induced plasticity in healthy adults. Finally, we discuss the advantages of a multi-modal approach to gain a more nuanced and comprehensive description of the process of learning. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Forty subjects searched for letter targets among digit distractors displayed in rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP). ERPs were examined under conditions where a single target was embedded among distractors and compared to those recorded when two consecutive targets were embedded among distractors. Standard and independent component analyses revealed two temporally and topographically distinct ERP responses, a midfrontal P3a component peaking at about 300 ms followed by a midparietal P3b component peaking at about 450 ms. With minimal latency variations, the frontal P3a was amplified when elicited by two consecutive targets relative to a single target. The parietal P3b response was also amplified when elicited by two consecutive targets compared to a single target but, in contrast to P3a, it was also associated with a substantially longer time course. These results provide evidence for the involvement of frontal brain regions in the close-to-concurrent selection of two consecutive targets displayed in RSVP, and of posterior brain regions in the serial encoding of targets in visual working memory. The present findings are discussed in relation to current models of temporal gating of attention and the attentional blink effect.

Compared to the general population, tobacco smoking cessation rates are lower in schizophrenia. Unfortunately, the reasons for these low cessation rates remain poorly understood. Recently, it has been shown that tobacco cravings are increased in schizophrenia smokers compared to smokers with no comorbid psychiatric disorder. In view of these results, we sought to examine - for the first time - the neurophysiologic responses elicited by cigarette cues in schizophrenia smokers. We hypothesized that cigarettes cues would elicit increased activations in brain regions involved in drug cravings in schizophrenia smokers relative to control smokers. Methods: Smokers with (n = 18) and without (n = 24) schizophrenia (DSM-IV criteria) were scanned using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while viewing appetitive cigarette images. Results: Schizophrenia smokers and smokers with no psychiatric comorbidity did not differ in subjective cravings in response to appetitive smoking cues. However, in schizophrenia smokers relative to control smokers, we found that appetitive cigarette cues triggered increased activations of the bilateral ventro-medial prefrontal cortex, a core region of the brain reward system. Moreover, a negative correlation was observed between cigarette cravings and activations of the right ventro-medial prefrontal cortex in schizophrenia smokers. Discussion: The current results highlight a key role of the brain reward system in cigarette craving in schizophrenia, and suggest that the neurophysiologic mechanisms involved in the regulation of cue-induced cigarette craving are impaired in this population.

The system is fully automated. It uses fuzzy logic and compounding for de-noising. A fuzzy membership function based on the gray values of ultrasound images is applied for de-noising, improving the quality of the image and increasing separation between foreground and background, thus making easier detection of lesions. A novel approach based on neural network is used for segmentation of ultrasound images, and correlation between ultrasound images taken from different angles allows overcoming the problem of shadowing. We consider a combination of morphological and texture features and use sequential forward search, sequential backward search, and distance-based method to select the best subset of features. We rank the features using distance-based method and use a combination of sequential forward search and sequential backward search to select the best features (bidirectional search). Finally, support vector machine classifier is used for detecting suspicious lesions. The results of experiments show that our system performs better than other state-of-the-art computer-aided diagnosis systems with the accuracy of 98.75%. Furthermore, we used concurrency to improve the computational efficiency. In concurrent implementation of de-noising, segmentation, and feature selection and extraction, we assign each pixel of an ultrasound image to a different thread. We also benefit from multi-core computing by running each classifier on a different thread. Concurrent implementation of our computer-aided diagnosis system reduces overall computational time by 85%.

Effects of insular stimulation on thermal nociception	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PAIN			English	Article							DEEP BRAIN-STIMULATION; HIGH-FREQUENCY STIMULATION; TEMPORAL-LOBE EPILEPSY; ELECTRICAL-STIMULATION; CORTICAL STIMULATION; SOMATIC SENSATION; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; CENTRAL PAIN; ACTIVATION; MECHANISMS	BackgroundElectrical stimulation used for brain mapping in the postero-superior insula can evoke pain. The effects of prolonged high frequency insular stimulation on pain thresholds are unknown. Objective/HypothesisProlonged high frequency insular stimulation, by virtue of its inhibitory properties on networks, could decrease thermal nociception. MethodsEpileptic subjects had electrodes implanted in the insular cortex for the purpose of epileptic focus resection. Thermal and pressure nociceptive thresholds were tested bilaterally on the forearm on two consecutive days. Randomly assigned double-blind high frequency (150Hz) insular stimulation took place for 10min before pain testing either on the first day or on the second day. ResultsSix subjects (three females; mean age of 35years) were included. Insular stimulation increased heat pain threshold on the ipsilateral (p=0.003; n=6) and contralateral sides (p=0.047; n=6). Differences in cold pain threshold did not reach statistical significance (ipsilateral: p=0.341, contralateral: p=0.143; n=6), but one subject had a profound decrease in both heat and cold pain responses. Pressure pain threshold was not modified by insular stimulation (ipsilateral: p=0.1123; contralateral: p=0.1192; n=6). Two of the three subjects who had a postero-superior operculo-insulectomy developed central pain with contralateral thermal nociceptive deficit. ConclusionsHigh frequency inhibitory postero-superior insular stimulation may have the potential to decrease thermal nociception. Together with previous studies, our data support the notion that the integrity of this brain region is necessary for thermal but not pressure nociceptive processing.	[Denis, D.

Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2011; Goldstein et al. in Assessment of autism spectrum disorders. Guilford Press, New York, 2008; Mottron in J Autism Dev Disord 34(1):19-27, 2004). However, previous studies suggest that while WISC-III and Raven's Progressive Matrices (RPM) provide similar estimates of non-autistic intelligence, autistic children perform significantly better on RPM (Dawson et al. in Psychol Sci 18(8):657-662, doi:10.1111/j.1467-9280.2007.01954.x10.1111/j.1467-9280.2007.01954.x", 2007). The latest WISC version introduces substantial changes in subtests and index scores; thus, we asked whether WISC-IV still underestimates autistic intelligence. Twenty-five autistic and 22 typical children completed WISC-IV and RPM. Autistic children's RPM scores were significantly higher than their WISC-IV FSIQ, but there was no significant difference in typical children. Further, autistic children showed a distinctively uneven WISC-IV index profile, with a "peak" in the new Perceptual Reasoning Index. In spite of major changes, WISC-IV FSIQ continues to underestimate autistic intelligence.

Evidence suggests that there may be a link between current depressive symptoms and Alzheimer disease (AD)-associated pathological changes, such as an increase in cortical amyloid- (A). However, limited in vivo studies have explored the relationship between current depressive symptoms and cortical A in patients with MCI and AD. Our study, using a large sample of 455 patients with MCI and 153 patients with AD from the Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging Initiatives, investigated whether current depressive symptoms are related to cortical A deposition. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Geriatric Depression Scale and Neuropsychiatric Inventory-depression/dysphoria. Cortical A was quantified using positron emission tomography with the A probe F-18-florbetapir (AV-45). F-18-florbetapir standardized uptake value ratio (AV-45 SUVR) from the frontal, cingulate, parietal, and temporal regions was estimated. A global AV-45 SUVR, defined as the average of frontal, cingulate, precuneus, and parietal cortex, was also used. We observed that current depressive symptoms were not related to cortical A, after controlling for potential confounds, including history of major depression. We also observed that there was no difference in cortical A between matched participants with high and low depressive symptoms, as well as no difference between matched participants with the presence and absence of depressive symptoms. The association between depression and cortical A deposition does not exist, but the relationship is highly influenced by stressful events in the past, such as previous depressive episodes, and complex interactions of different pathways underlying both depression and dementia.

J	Mirahadi, F; Zayed, T				Mirahadi, Farid; Zayed, Tarek			Simulation-based construction productivity forecast using Neural-Network-Driven Fuzzy Reasoning	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Productivity prediction; Fuzzy reasoning; Artificial Neural Network; Genetic Algorithm; Fuzzy C-Means clustering; Hybrid modeling; Hyper-surface membership function	GENETIC ALGORITHM; RISK-ASSESSMENT; CHANGE ORDERS; SYSTEM; IMPACT; MANAGEMENT; OPERATIONS; LOGIC	Fuzzy models and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) systems are two well-known areas of soft-computing that have significantly helped researchers with decision-making under uncertainties. Uncertainty, an ever-present factor in construction projects, has made such intelligent systems very attractive to the construction industry. Estimating the productivity of construction operations, as a basic element of project planning and control, has become a remarkable target for forecasting models. A glimpse into this interdisciplinary field of research exposes the need for a system, that (1) models the effect of qualitative and quantitative variables on construction productivity with an improved accuracy of estimation and (2) has the ability to deal with both crisp and fuzzy input variables in one single framework. Neural-Network-Driven Fuzzy Reasoning (NNDFR), as one of the hybrid intelligent structures, displays a great potential for modeling datasets among which clear clusters are recognizable. The weakness of NNDFR in auto-tuning the design of fuzzy membership functions along with this model's insufficient attention to the optimization of number of clusters has created an area for further research. In this paper, the parameters (fuzzifier and number of clusters) of the proposed system are optimized by using Genetic Algorithm (GA) to fine-tune the system for the highest possible level of accuracy that can be exploited for productivity estimation. The proposed model is also capable of dealing with a combination of crisp and fuzzy input variables by using a hybrid modeling approach based on the application of the alpha-cut technique. The developed model helps researchers and practitioners use historical data to forecast the productivity of construction operations with a level of accuracy greater than what could be offered by traditional techniques.

Medical cannabis: considerations for the anesthesiologist and pain physician	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ANESTHESIA-JOURNAL CANADIEN D ANESTHESIE			English	Review							CHRONIC NONCANCER PAIN; NEUROPATHIC PAIN; DOUBLE-BLIND; SMOKED CANNABIS; PARALLEL-GROUP; CANCER PAIN; FOLLOW-UP; TRIAL; DELTA-9-TETRAHYDROCANNABINOL; TETRAHYDROCANNABINOL	New regulations are in place at the federal and provincial levels in Canada regarding the way medical cannabis is to be controlled. We present them together with guidance for the safe use of medical cannabis and recent clinical trials on cannabis and pain. The new Canadian regulations on the use of medical cannabis, the provincial regulations, and the various cannabis products available from the Canadian Licensed Producers were reviewed from Health Canada, provincial licensing authorities, and the licensed producers website, respectively. Recent clinical trials on cannabis and pain were reviewed from the existing literature. Health Canada has approved a new regulation on medical marijuana/cannabis, the Marihuana for Medical Purposes Regulations: The production of medical cannabis by individuals is illegal. Health Canada, however, has licensed authorized producers across the country, limiting the production to specific licenses of certain cannabis products. There are currently 26 authorized licensed producers from seven Canadian provinces offering more than 200 strains of marijuana. We provide guidance for the safe use of medical cannabis. The recent literature indicates that currently available cannabinoids are modestly effective analgesics that provide a safe, reasonable therapeutic option for managing chronic non-cancer-related pain. The science of medical cannabis and the need for education of healthcare professionals and patients require continued effort.

Hence, the prediction of crystal system has a vital importance to estimate many other properties of cathodes for applications in batteries. Three major crystal systems (monoclinic, orthorhombic and triclinic) of silicate-based cathodes with Li-Si-(Mn, Fe, Co)-O compositions were predicted using wide range of classification algorithms in machine learning. The calculations are based on the results of density functional theory calculations from Materials Project. The strong correlation between the crystal system and other physical properties of the cathodes was confirmed based on the feature evaluation in the statistical models. In addition, the parameters of various classification methods were optimized to obtain the best accuracy of prediction. Ensemble methods including random forests and extremely randomized trees provided the highest accuracy of prediction among other classification methods in the Monte Carlo cross validation tests.

These immune cells were shown to actively remodel neuronal circuits, leading to propose new pathogenic mechanisms. To study microglial implication in the loss of synapses, the best pathological correlate of cognitive decline across chronic stress, aging, and diseases, we recently conducted ultrastructural analyses. Our work uncovered the existence of a new microglial phenotype that is rarely present under steady state conditions, in hippocampus, cerebral cortex, amygdala, and hypothalamus, but becomes abundant during chronic stress, aging, fractalkine signaling deficiency (CX(3)CR1 knockout mice), and Alzheimer's disease pathology (APP-PS1 mice). Even though these cells display ultrastructural features of microglia, they are strikingly distinct from the other phenotypes described so far at the ultrastructural level. They exhibit several signs of oxidative stress, including a condensed, electron-dense cytoplasm and nucleoplasm making them as dark as mitochondria, accompanied by a pronounced remodeling of their nuclear chromatin. Dark microglia appear to be much more active than the normal microglia, reaching for synaptic clefts, while extensively encircling axon terminals and dendritic spines with their highly ramified and thin processes. They stain for the myeloid cell markers IBA1 and GFP (in CX(3)CR1-GFP mice), and strongly express CD11b and microglia-specific 4D4 in their processes encircling synaptic elements, and TREM2 when they associate with amyloid plaques. Overall, these findings suggest that dark microglia, a new phenotype that we identified based on their unique properties, could play a significant role in the pathological remodeling of neuronal circuits, especially at synapses.

Inspired by findings in the fields of neuroscience, computational neuroscience, and psychoacoustics, not only does the model extract spectral and temporal characteristics of a signal, but it also analyzes amplitude modulations on different timescales. It uses a cochlear filter bank to resolve the spectral components of a sound, lateral inhibition to enhance spectral resolution, and a modulation filter bank to extract the global temporal envelope and roughness of the sound from amplitude modulations. The model was evaluated in three applications. First, it was used to simulate subjective data from two roughness experiments. Second, it was used for musical instrument classification using the k-NN algorithm and a Bayesian network. Third, it was applied to find the features that characterize sounds whose timbres were labeled in an audiovisual experiment. The successful application of the proposed model in these diverse tasks revealed its potential in capturing timbral information.

How this occurs was previously examined in detail in a swimmer using body undulations (lamprey), but in tetrapods the downstream projections from the MLR to brainstem neurons are not fully understood. Here we examined the brainstem circuits from the MLR to identified reticulospinal neurons in the salamander Notophthalmus viridescens. Using neural tracing, we show that the MLR sends bilateral projections to the middle reticular nucleus (mRN, rostral hindbrain) and the inferior reticular nucleus (iRN, caudal hindbrain). Ca2+ imaging coupled to electrophysiology in in vitro isolated brains revealed very similar responses in reticulospinal neurons on both sides to a unilateral MLR stimulation. As the strength of MLR stimulation was increased, the responses increased in size in reticulospinal neurons of the mRN and iRN, but the responses in the iRN were smaller. Bath-application or local microinjections of glutamatergic antagonists markedly reduced reticulospinal neuron responses, indicating that the MLR sends glutamatergic inputs to reticulospinal neurons. In addition, reticulospinal cells responded to glutamate microinjections and the size of the responses paralleled the amount of glutamate microinjected. Immunofluorescence coupled with anatomical tracing confirmed the presence of glutamatergic projections from the MLR to reticulospinal neurons. Overall, we show that the brainstem circuits activated by the MLR in the salamander are organized similarly to those previously described in lampreys, indicating that the anatomo-physiological features of the locomotor drive are well conserved in vertebrates.

Inter-participant variability (physiological and physical differences) was considered. Twenty-eight participants performed Meyer and Flenghi's step-test and a maximal treadmill test, during which heart rate and oxygen consumption ((V) over dot O-2) were measured. Results indicated that heart rate monitoring (HR, HRmax, and HRrest) and body weight are significant variables for classifying work rate. The ANFIS classifier showed superior sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy compared to current practice using established work rate categories based on percent heart rate reserve (%HRR). The ANFIS classifier showed an overall 29.6% difference in classification accuracy and a good balance between sensitivity (90.7%) and specificity (95.2%) on average. With its ease of implementation and variable measurement, the ANFIS classifier shows potential for widespread use by practitioners for work rate assessment.

Flatness-based adaptive fuzzy control of electrostatically actuated MEMS using output feedback	FUZZY SETS AND SYSTEMS			English	Article						Electrostatically actuated MEMS; Adaptive fuzzy control; Neurofuzzy approximation; State observers; Lyapunov stability; H-infinity tracking performance; Riccati equations		The article presents an adaptive fuzzy control approach to the problem of control of electrostatically actuated MEMS, which is based on differential flatness theory and which uses exclusively output feedback. It is shown that the model of the electrostatically actuated MEMS is a differentially flat one and this permits to transform it to the so-called linear canonical form. For the new description of the system's dynamics the transformed control inputs contain unknown terms which depend on the system's parameters. To identify these terms an adaptive fuzzy approximator is used in the control loop. Thus an adaptive fuzzy control scheme is implemented in which the unknown or unmodeled system dynamics is approximated by neurofuzzy networks and next this information is used by a feedback controller that makes the electrostatically activated MEMS converge to the desirable motion setpoints. This adaptive control scheme is exclusively implemented with the use of output feedback, while the state vector elements which are not directly measured are estimated with the use of a state observer that operates in the control loop. The learning rate of the adaptive fuzzy system is suitably computed from Lyapunov analysis, so as to assure that both the learning procedure for the unknown system's parameters, the dynamics of the observer and the dynamics of the control loop will remain stable. The Lyapunov stability analysis depends on two Riccati equations, one associated with the feedback controller and one associated with the state observer. Finally, it is proven that for the control scheme that comprises the feedback controller, the state observer and the neurofuzzy approximator, an H-infinity tracking performance can be achieved. The functioning of the control loop has been evaluated through simulation experiments. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We hypothesized that this changes the epidemiology of MODS. Thus, we determined the epidemiology of MODS, according to these two sets of diagnostic criteria, we studied the intra- and inter-observer reproducibility of each set of diagnostic criteria, and we compared the association between cases of MODS at paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) entry, as diagnosed by each set of diagnostic criteria, and 90-day all-cause mortality. Methods: All consecutive patients admitted to the tertiary care PICU of Sainte-Justine Hospital, from April 21, 2009 to April 20, 2010, were considered eligible for enrolment into this prospective observational cohort study. The exclusion criteria were gestational age < 40 weeks, age < 3 days or > 18 years at PICU entry, pregnancy, admission immediately after delivery. No patients were censored. Daily monitoring using medical chart ended when the patient died or was discharged from PICU. Mortality was monitored up to death, hospital discharge, or 90 days post PICU entry, whatever happened first. Concordance rate and kappa score were calculated to assess reproducibility. The number of MODS identified with Proulx and Goldstein definitions was compared using 2-by-2 contingency tables. Student's t test or Wilcoxon signed-ranked test was used to compare continuous variables with normal or abnormal distribution, respectively. We performed a Kaplan-Meier survival analysis to assess the association between MODS at PICU entry and 90-day mortality. Results: The occurrence of MODS was monitored daily and prospectively in 842 consecutive patients admitted to the PICU of Sainte-Justine Hospital over 1 year. According to Proulx and Goldstein diagnostic criteria, 180 (21.4 %) and 314 patients (37.3 %) had MODS over PICU stay, respectively. Concordance of MODS diagnosis over PICU stay was 81.3 % (95 % CI 78.6-83.9 %), and kappa score was 0.56 (95 % CI 0.50-0.61). Discordance was mainly attributable to cardiovascular or neurological dysfunction criteria. The proportion of patients with MODS at PICU entry who died within 90 days was higher with MODS diagnosed with Proulx criteria (17.8 vs. 11.5 %, p = 0.038), as well as the likelihood ratio of death (4.84 vs. 2.37). On the other hand, 90-day survival rate of patients without MODS at PICU entry was similar (98.6 vs. 98.9 % (p = 0.73). Conclusions: Proulx and Goldstein diagnostic criteria of paediatric MODS are not equivalent. The epidemiology of paediatric MODS varies depending on which set of diagnostic criteria is applied.

Neural correlations enable invariant coding and perception of natural stimuli in weakly electric fish	ELIFE			English	Article							LATERAL-LINE LOBE; APTERONOTUS-LEPTORHYNCHUS; ELECTROSENSORY NEURONS; RECEPTIVE-FIELDS; COMMUNICATION SIGNALS; VISUAL-CORTEX; DIRECTIONAL SELECTIVITY; TORUS SEMICIRCULARIS; DROSOPHILA BRAIN; OLFACTORY SYSTEM	Neural representations of behaviorally relevant stimulus features displaying invariance with respect to different contexts are essential for perception. However, the mechanisms mediating their emergence and subsequent refinement remain poorly understood in general. Here, we demonstrate that correlated neural activity allows for the emergence of an invariant representation of natural communication stimuli that is further refined across successive stages of processing in the weakly electric fish Apteronotus leptorhynchus. Importantly, different patterns of input resulting from the same natural communication stimulus occurring in different contexts all gave rise to similar behavioral responses.

Combination of 7 and NOP ligands (e.g., H-Arg-Tyr-Tyr-Arg-Ile-Lys-NH2) led to binding affinities in the low nanomolar domain. In vitro, the hybrids behaved as agonists at the opioid receptors and antagonists at the nociceptin receptor. Intravenous administration of hybrid 13a (H-Dmt-D-Arg-Aba-beta-Ala-Arg-Tyr-Tyr-Arg-Ile-Lys-NH2) to mice resulted in potent and long lasting antinociception in the tail-flick test, indicating that 13a was able to permeate the BBB. This was further supported by a cell-based BBB model. All hybrids alleviated allodynia and hyperalgesia in neuropathic pain models. Especially with respect to hyperalgesia, they showed to be more effective than the parent compounds. Hybrid 13a did not result in significant respiratory depression, in contrast to an equipotent analgesic dose of morphine. These hybrids hence represent a promising avenue toward analgesics for the dual treatment of acute and neuropathic pain.

Oligodendrogliopathy in Multiple Sclerosis: Low Glycolytic Metabolic Rate Promotes Oligodendrocyte Survival	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						aerobic glycolysis; metabolic stress; multiple sclerosis; oligodendrocytes; oligodendrogliopathy	AEROBIC GLYCOLYSIS; WHITE-MATTER; HUMAN BRAIN; LESIONS; INJURY; MYELIN; NEURODEGENERATION; HYPOXIA; ENERGY; DEMYELINATION	Multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions feature demyelination with limited remyelination. A distinct injury phenotype of MS lesions features dying back of oligodendrocyte (OL) terminal processes, a response that destabilizes myelin/axon interactions. This oligodendrogliopathy has been linked with local metabolic stress, similar to the penumbra of ischemic/hypoxic states. Here, we developed an in vitro oligodendrogliopathy model using human CNS-derived OLs and related this injury response to their distinct bioenergetic properties. We determined the energy utilization properties of adult human surgically derived OLs cultured under either optimal or metabolic stress conditions, deprivation of growth factors, and glucose and/or hypoxia using a Seahorse extracellular flux analyzer. Baseline studies were also performed on OL progenitor cells derived from the same tissue and postnatal rat-derived cells. Under basal conditions, adult human OLs were less metabolically active than their progenitors and both were less active than the rat cells. Human OLs and progenitors both used aerobic glycolysis for the majority of ATP production, a process that contributes to protein and lipid production necessary for myelin biosynthesis. Under stress conditions that induce significant process retraction with only marginal cell death, human OLs exhibited a significant reduction in overall energy utilization, particularly in glycolytic ATP production. The stress-induced reduction of glycolytic ATP production by the human OLs would exacerbate myelin process withdrawal while favoring cell survival, providing a potential basis for the oligodendrogliopathy observed in MS. The glycolytic pathway is a potential therapeutic target to promote myelin maintenance and enhance repair in MS.

Here, we show that a reduction of FET proteins in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans causes synaptic dysfunction accompanied by impaired motor phenotypes. FET proteins are also involved in the regulation of lifespan and stress resistance, acting partially through the insulin/IGF-signalling pathway. We propose that FET proteins are involved in the maintenance of lifespan, cellular stress resistance and neuronal integrity.	[Therrien, Martine; Parker, J.

Several conformation-restricted antibodies have been generated that specifically recognize misfolded SOD1 protein, and have been used as therapeutics in pre-clinical models. Misfolded SOD1 selectively associates with spinal cord mitochondria in SOD1 rodent models. Using the SOD1(G93A) rat model, we find that SOD1 conformational specific antibodies AMF7-63 and DSE2-3H1 labeled a fibrillar network concentrated in the anterior horn; while A5C3, B8H10, C4F6 and D3H5 labeled motor neurons as well as puncta in the neuropil. There is a time-dependent accumulation of misfolded SOD1 at the surface of spinal cord mitochondria with AMF7-63-labeled mitochondria having increased volume in contrast to a mitochondrial subset labeled with B8H10. In spinal cord homogenates and isolated mitochondria, AMF7-63, DSE2-3H1 and B8H10 detect misfolded SOD1 aggregates. SOD1 that lacks its metal cofactors has an increased affinity for naive mitochondria and misfolded SOD1 antibodies B8H10 and DSE2-3H1 readily detect demetalated mutant and wild-type SOD1. Together, these data suggest that multiple non-native species of misfolded SOD1 may exist, some of which are associated with mitochondrial damage. Conformational antibodies are invaluable tools to identify and characterize the variation in misfolded SOD1 species with regards to biochemical characteristics and toxicity. This information is highly relevant to the further development of these reagents as therapeutics.

Neural correlates of the LSD experience revealed by multimodal neuroimaging	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						LSD; serotonin; consciousness; brain; psychedelic	STATE FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; HEALTHY-VOLUNTEERS; VISUAL HALLUCINATIONS; 1ST-DEGREE RELATIVES; ANTIPSYCHOTIC-DRUGS; PSYCHEDELIC STATE; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; BRAIN-FUNCTION; ALPHA-ACTIVITY; LYSERGIC-ACID	Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) is the prototypical psychedelic drug, but its effects on the human brain have never been studied before with modern neuroimaging. Here, three complementary neuroimaging techniques: arterial spin labeling (ASL), blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) measures, and magnetoencephalography (MEG), implemented during resting state conditions, revealed marked changes in brain activity after LSD that correlated strongly with its characteristic psychological effects. Increased visual cortex cerebral blood flow (CBF), decreased visual cortex alpha power, and a greatly expanded primary visual cortex (V1) functional connectivity profile correlated strongly with ratings of visual hallucinations, implying that intrinsic brain activity exerts greater influence on visual processing in the psychedelic state, thereby defining its hallucinatory quality. LSD's marked effects on the visual cortex did not significantly correlate with the drug's other characteristic effects on consciousness, however. Rather, decreased connectivity between the parahippocampus and retrosplenial cortex (RSC) correlated strongly with ratings of "ego-dissolution" and "altered meaning," implying the importance of this particular circuit for the maintenance of "self" or "ego" and its processing of "meaning." Strong relationships were also found between the different imaging metrics, enabling firmer inferences to be made about their functional significance. This uniquely comprehensive examination of the LSD state represents an important advance in scientific research with psychedelic drugs at a time of growing interest in their scientific and therapeutic value. The present results contribute important new insights into the characteristic hallucinatory and consciousness-altering properties of psychedelics that inform on how they can model certain pathological states and potentially treat others.

Their loss in Parkinson's disease is devastating. In lampreys, we recently showed that brainstem networks also receive direct descending dopaminergic inputs that potentiate locomotor output. Here, we provide evidence that this descending dopaminergic pathway is conserved to higher vertebrates, including mammals. In salamanders, dopamine neurons projecting to the striatum or brainstem locomotor networks were partly intermingled. Stimulation of the dopaminergic region evoked dopamine release in brainstem locomotor networks and concurrent reticulospinal activity. In rats, some dopamine neurons projecting to the striatum also innervated the pedunculopontine nucleus, a known locomotor center, and stimulation of the dopaminergic region evoked pedunculopontine dopamine release in vivo. Finally, we found dopaminergic fibers in the human pedunculopontine nucleus. The conservation of a descending dopaminergic pathway across vertebrates warrants re-evaluating dopamine's role in locomotion.

Brojen			Scaling in topological properties of brain networks	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							SMALL-WORLD; BETWEENNESS CENTRALITY; COMPLEX NETWORKS; NERVOUS-SYSTEM; BIOLOGICAL NETWORKS; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; ORGANIZATION; DIFFUSION; HUBS; IDENTIFICATION	The organization in brain networks shows highly modular features with weak inter-modular interaction. The topology of the networks involves emergence of modules and sub-modules at different levels of constitution governed by fractal laws that are signatures of self-organization in complex networks. The modular organization, in terms of modular mass, inter-modular, and intra-modular interaction, also obeys fractal nature. The parameters which characterize topological properties of brain networks follow one parameter scaling theory in all levels of network structure, which reveals the self-similar rules governing the network structure. Further, the calculated fractal dimensions of brain networks of different species are found to decrease when one goes from lower to higher level species which implicates the more ordered and self-organized topography at higher level species. The sparsely distributed hubs in brain networks may be most influencing nodes but their absence may not cause network breakdown, and centrality parameters characterizing them also follow one parameter scaling law indicating self-similar roles of these hubs at different levels of organization in brain networks. The local-community-paradigm decomposition plot and calculated local-community-paradigm-correlation co-efficient of brain networks also shows the evidence for self-organization in these networks.

We identified 2 novel MRI patterns: 4 participants presented a selective involvement of the corticospinal tracts, specifically at the level of the posterior limbs of the internal capsules; 4 patients presented moderate to severe cerebellar atrophy. Incomplete hypomyelination was observed in 5 participants.Conclusion:Diffuse hypomyelination is not an obligatory feature of POLR3-related disorders. Two distinct patterns, selective involvement of the corticospinal tracts and cerebellar atrophy, are added to the MRI presentation of POLR3-related disorders.

Herein, a three-component tandem CDC cyclization by a Pummerer-type rearrangement to afford biologically relevant isoindolinones from aromatic acids, amides, and DMSO, is described. This intermolecular tandem reaction undergoes a C(sp(2))-H/C(sp(3))-H cross-dehydrogenative coupling, C-N bond formation, and intramolecular amidation. A notable feature of this novel protocol is avoiding a catalyst and additive (apart from oxidant).

Anne			Rewiring neuronal microcircuits of the brain via spine head protrusions-a role for synaptopodin and intracellular calcium stores	ACTA NEUROPATHOLOGICA COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						Dendritic spines; Synaptopodin; Calcium; Structural plasticity; Ryanodine	LONG-TERM POTENTIATION; ACTIN-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN; DENDRITIC SPINES; SYNAPTIC PLASTICITY; CORD-INJURY; HIPPOCAMPAL-NEURONS; IN-VIVO; POSTTRAUMATIC EPILEPSY; ENDOPLASMIC-RETICULUM; FUNCTIONAL RECOVERY	Neurological diseases associated with neuronal death are also accompanied by axonal denervation of connected brain regions. In these areas, denervation leads to a decrease in afferent drive, which may in turn trigger active central nervous system (CNS) circuitry rearrangement. This rewiring process is important therapeutically, since it can partially recover functions and can be further enhanced using modern rehabilitation strategies. Nevertheless, the cellular mechanisms of brain rewiring are not fully understood. We recently reported a mechanism by which neurons remodel their local connectivity under conditions of network-perturbance: hippocampal pyramidal cells can extend spine head protrusions (SHPs), which reach out toward neighboring terminals and form new synapses. Since this form of activity-dependent rewiring is observed only on some spines, we investigated the required conditions. We speculated, that the actin-associated protein synaptopodin, which is involved in several synaptic plasticity mechanisms, could play a role in the formation and/or stabilization of SHPs. Using hippocampal slice cultures, we found that similar to 70 % of spines with protrusions in CA1 pyramidal neurons contained synaptopodin. Analysis of synaptopodin-deficient neurons revealed that synaptopodin is required for the stability but not the formation of SHPs. The effects of synaptopodin could be linked to its role in Ca2+ homeostasis, since spines with protrusions often contained ryanodine receptors and synaptopodin. Furthermore, disrupting Ca2+ signaling shortened protrusion lifetime. By transgenically reintroducing synaptopodin on a synaptopodin-deficient background, SHP stability could be rescued. Overall, we show that synaptopodin increases the stability of SHPs, and could potentially modulate the rewiring of microcircuitries by making synaptic reorganization more efficient.

Examining cortical thickness in male and female DWI offenders	NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS			English	Article						First-time offenders; Driving while impaired; Alcohol; DWI; DUI; Magnetic resonance imaging; Executive control	ALCOHOL DEPENDENCE; DECISION-MAKING; RISK-TAKING; DUI; WOMEN; PERSONALITY; RECIDIVISTS; DRINKING; SCALE	Some sex differences have been detected in driving while impaired by alcohol (DWI) offenders. However, understanding of the key factors contributing to DWI among male and female drivers remains elusive, limiting development of targeted interventions. Sex-based neurocognitive analyses could provide the much-needed insight. We examined whether male DWI offenders show cortical thickness anomalies that differ from those in female DWI offenders, when compared to their respective controls. Moderating role of sex and alcohol use on DWI status was also investigated. Sixty-one DWI offenders (29 male; 32 female) and 58 controls (29 male; 29 female) completed an anatomical brain scan and assessments on other relevant characteristics. Only male DWI offenders had reduced cortical thickness in the right dorsal posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), a region involved in cognitive control. Lower cortical thickness was associated with increased odds of DWI status only among males who have not engaged in very hazardous pattern of alcohol misuse in the previous 12 months. Thus, for these male DWI drivers, interventions that could impact PCC could be most advantageous. Continued multidimensional sex analysis of the neural characteristics of male and female DWI offenders is warranted. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AGE-RELATED AUDIOVISUAL INTERACTIONS IN THE SUPERIOR COLLICULUS OF THE RAT	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						aging; optic flow; concentric spatial frequency; vision; auditory; audiovisual integration	VISUAL CORTICAL-CELLS; AMPLITUDE-MODULATED STIMULI; MULTISENSORY INTEGRATION; INFERIOR COLLICULUS; RESPONSE PROPERTIES; FUNCTIONAL DEGRADATION; EXTRASTRIATE CORTEX; NEURONAL RESPONSES; AUDITORY-CORTEX; RHESUS-MONKEYS	It is well established that multisensory integration is a functional characteristic of the superior colliculus that disambiguates external stimuli and therefore reduces the reaction times toward simple audiovisual targets in space. However, in a condition where a complex audiovisual stimulus is used, such as the optical flow in the presence of modulated audio signals, little is known about the processing of the multisensory integration in the superior colliculus. Furthermore, since visual and auditory deficits constitute hallmark signs during aging, we sought to gain some insight on whether audiovisual processes in the superior colliculus are altered with age. Extracellular single-unit recordings were conducted in the superior colliculus of anesthetized Sprague-Dawley adult (10-12 months) and aged (21-22 months) rats. Looming circular concentric sinusoidal (CCS) gratings were presented alone and in the presence of sinusoidally amplitude modulated white noise. In both groups of rats, two different audiovisual response interactions were encountered in the spatial domain: superadditive, and suppressive. In contrast, additive audiovisual interactions were found only in adult rats. Hence, superior colliculus audiovisual interactions were more numerous in adult rats (38%) than in aged rats (8%). These results suggest that intersensory interactions in the superior colliculus play an essential role in space processing toward audiovisual moving objects during self-motion. Moreover, aging has a deleterious effect on complex audiovisual interactions. (C) 2016 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, the underlying neural mechanisms of this high spatial frequency training improvement remain to be elucidated. In the present study, we examined four properties of neurons in primary visual cortex (area 17) of adult cats that exhibited significantly improved acuity after contrast sensitivity training with a high spatial frequency grating and those of untrained control cats. We found no difference in neuronal contrast sensitivity or tuning width (Width) between the trained and untrained cats. However, the trained cats showed a displacement of the cells' optimal spatial frequency (OSF) to higher spatial frequencies as well as a larger neuronal signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Furthermore, both the neuronal differences in OSF and SNR were significantly correlated with the improvement of acuity measured behaviorally. These results suggest that striate neurons might mediate the perceptual learning-induced improvement for high spatial frequency stimuli by an alteration in their spatial frequency representation and by an increased SNR.

Perceptual learning shapes multisensory causal inference via two distinct mechanisms	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							TEMPORAL BINDING WINDOW; MACAQUE MONKEY; INTEGRATION; ADAPTATION; CORTEX; SENSES	To accurately represent the environment, our brains must integrate sensory signals from a common source while segregating those from independent sources. A reasonable strategy for performing this task is to restrict integration to cues that coincide in space and time. However, because multisensory signals are subject to differential transmission and processing delays, the brain must retain a degree of tolerance for temporal discrepancies. Recent research suggests that the width of this 'temporal binding window' can be reduced through perceptual learning, however, little is known about the mechanisms underlying these experience-dependent effects. Here, in separate experiments, we measure the temporal and spatial binding windows of human participants before and after training on an audiovisual temporal discrimination task. We show that training leads to two distinct effects on multisensory integration in the form of (i) a specific narrowing of the temporal binding window that does not transfer to spatial binding and (ii) a general reduction in the magnitude of crossmodal interactions across all spatiotemporal disparities. These effects arise naturally from a Bayesian model of causal inference in which learning improves the precision of audiovisual timing estimation, whilst concomitantly decreasing the prior expectation that stimuli emanate from a common source.

Loss of health related quality of life following low-trauma fractures in the elderly	BMC GERIATRICS			English	Article						Frail elderly; Fractures; Health-related quality of life	OSTEOPOROSIS-RELATED FRACTURES; HIP FRACTURE; WOMEN; DIAGNOSIS; IMPACT; SWEDEN; CANADA; COSTS; RISK; MEN	Background: To estimate the long-term change in health related quality of life (HRQoL) following low-trauma fractures among individuals receiving home care (HC) services or living in long-term care (LTC) facilities using linked healthcare administrative data from Ontario, Canada. Methods: HRQoL was estimated using the Health Utility Index (HUI-2) with the InterRai Minimum Data Set (MDS), a mandatory questionnaire for LTC and HC in the province of Ontario (population 14 million). The HUI-2, a validated HRQoL instrument, allows the calculation of health utility where 0 represents death and 1 the best imaginable health state. For reference, the HUI-2 utility value for Canadians aged 80-84 years is 0.61 and the minimal clinically important difference is 0.03. The MDS was linked to Ontario acute care databases for fiscal years 2007-2011 to identify low-trauma fractures using ICD-10-CA codes. Regression models were used to identify predictors of change in HRQoL from pre-fracture levels to 3 years post fracture for several populations. Low-trauma fractures included hip, humerus, vertebral, wrist, multiple and other. Results: Twenty-three thousand six-hundred fifty-five unique patients with low-trauma fractures were identified with pre- and post-fracture HRQoL assessments, of which 5057 individuals had at least 3 years of follow-up. Compared to patients receiving HC services (N = 3303), individuals residing in LTC (N = 1754) were older, taking more medications, and had more comorbidities. LTC patients had more hip fractures (49 % of total versus 29 %). For all fracture types, HRQoL decreased immediately following fracture. Although levels rebounded after the first month, HRQoL up to 36 months never returned to pre-fracture levels even for non-hip fracture. For both HC and LTC cohorts, clinically important and statistically significant decreases in HUI-2 utility scores were observed 36 months post fracture. Of the 6 HUI-2 domains, mobility had the largest impact on change in HRQoL. Regression analysis indicated that living with a musculoskeletal disorder or a neurological condition and living in LTC were associated with greater decrements in utility following a fracture. Conclusions: Based on the analysis of one of the largest studies on HRQoL to date, among individuals living in LTC facilities or receiving HC services, fractures have a significant permanent impact on HRQoL up to 3 years following fracture.

High Resolution Dissection of Reactive Glial Nets in Alzheimer's Disease	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							BETA-AMYLOID PLAQUES; TRANSGENIC MICE; NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS; MICROGLIAL CELLS; TAU PATHOLOGY; MOUSE MODEL; ASTROCYTES; BRAIN; DEPOSITION; CYTOKINES	Fixed human brain samples in tissue repositories hold great potential for unlocking complexities of the brain and its alteration with disease. However, current methodology for simultaneously resolving complex three-dimensional (3D) cellular anatomy and organization, as well as, intricate details of human brain cells in tissue has been limited due to weak labeling characteristics of the tissue and high background levels. To expose the potential of these samples, we developed a method to overcome these major limitations. This approach offers an unprecedented view of cytoarchitecture and subcellular detail of human brain cells, from cellular networks to individual synapses. Applying the method to AD samples, we expose complex features of microglial cells and astrocytes in the disease. Through this methodology, we show that these cells form specialized 3D structures in AD that we refer to as reactive glial nets (RGNs). RGNs are areas of concentrated neuronal injury, inflammation, and tauopathy and display unique features around beta-amyloid plaque types. RGNs have conserved properties in an AD mouse model and display a developmental pattern coinciding with the progressive accumulation of neuropathology. The method provided here will help reveal novel features of the healthy and diseased human brain, and aid experimental design in translational brain research.

CAN-BIND Investigator Team	Discovering biomarkers for antidepressant response: protocol from the Canadian biomarker integration network in depression (CAN-BIND) and clinical characteristics of the first patient cohort	BMC PSYCHIATRY			English	Article							INTERNATIONAL NEUROPSYCHIATRIC INTERVIEW; RATING-SCALE; MAJOR DEPRESSION; DOUBLE-BLIND; DSM-IV; DISORDER; RELIABILITY; VALIDATION; QUESTIONNAIRE; VALIDITY	Background: Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is among the most prevalent and disabling medical conditions worldwide. Identification of clinical and biological markers ("biomarkers") of treatment response could personalize clinical decisions and lead to better outcomes. This paper describes the aims, design, and methods of a discovery study of biomarkers in antidepressant treatment response, conducted by the Canadian Biomarker Integration Network in Depression (CAN-BIND). The CAN-BIND research program investigates and identifies biomarkers that help to predict outcomes in patients with MDD treated with antidepressant medication. The primary objective of this initial study (known as CAN-BIND-1) is to identify individual and integrated neuroimaging, electrophysiological, molecular, and clinical predictors of response to sequential antidepressant monotherapy and adjunctive therapy in MDD. Methods: CAN-BIND-1 is a multisite initiative involving 6 academic health centres working collaboratively with other universities and research centres. In the 16-week protocol, patients with MDD are treated with a first-line antidepressant (escitalopram 10-20 mg/d) that, if clinically warranted after eight weeks, is augmented with an evidence-based, add-on medication (aripiprazole 2-10 mg/d). Comprehensive datasets are obtained using clinical rating scales; behavioural, dimensional, and functioning/quality of life measures; neurocognitive testing; genomic, genetic, and proteomic profiling from blood samples; combined structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging; and electroencephalography. De-identified data from all sites are aggregated within a secure neuroinformatics platform for data integration, management, storage, and analyses. Statistical analyses will include multivariate and machine-learning techniques to identify predictors, moderators, and mediators of treatment response. Discussion: From June 2013 to February 2015, a cohort of 134 participants (85 outpatients with MDD and 49 healthy participants) has been evaluated at baseline. The clinical characteristics of this cohort are similar to other studies of MDD. Recruitment at all sites is ongoing to a target sample of 290 participants. CAN-BIND will identify biomarkers of treatment response in MDD through extensive clinical, molecular, and imaging assessments, in order to improve treatment practice and clinical outcomes. It will also create an innovative, robust platform and database for future research.

In urochordate embryos, Cdx loss-of-function has been shown to impair axial elongation, neural tube (NT) closure and pigment cell development. Intriguingly, in contrast to axial elongation and NT closure, a Cdx role in neural crest (NC)-derived melanocyte/pigment cell development has not been reported in any other chordate species. To address this, we generated a new conditional pan-Cdx functional knockdown mouse model that circumvents Cdx functional redundancy as well as the early embryonic lethality of Cdx mutants. Through directed inhibition in the neuroectoderm, we provide in vivo evidence that murine Cdx proteins impact melanocyte and enteric nervous system development by, at least in part, directly controlling the expression of the key early regulators of NC ontogenesis Pax3, Msx1 and Foxd3. Our work thus reveals a novel role for Cdx proteins at the top of the trunk NC gene regulatory network in the mouse, which appears to have been inherited from their ancestral ortholog.

Among them, O-mannosylation is an unusual type of protein glycosylation that is largely restricted to the muscular and nerve system. Consistently, mutations in genes involved in the O-mannosylation pathway result in infantile-onset, severe developmental defects involving skeleton muscle, brain and eye, such as the muscle-eye-brain disease (MIM no. 253280). However, the functional importance of O-mannosylation in these tissues at later stages remains largely unknown. In our study, we have identified recessive mutations in POMGNT1, which encodes an essential component in O-mannosylation pathway, in three unrelated families with autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa (RP), but without extraocular involvement. Enzymatic assay of these mutant alleles demonstrate that they greatly reduce the POMGNT1 enzymatic activity and are likely to be hypomorphic. Immunohistochemistry shows that POMGNT1 is specifically expressed in photoreceptor basal body. Taken together, our work identifies a novel disease-causing gene for RP and indicates that proper protein O-mannosylation is not only essential for early organ development, but also important for maintaining survival and function of the highly specialized retinal cells at later stages.

BPD survivors typically suffer long-term injuries not only to the lungs, but also to the brain and retina. However, currently it is not clear whether the brain and retinal injuries in these newborns are related only to their prematurity, or also to BPD. We investigated whether the hyperoxia known to cause histologic changes in the lungs similar to BPD in an animal model also causes brain and retinal injuries. Sprague Dawley rat pups were exposed to hyperoxia (95% O-2, 'BPD' group) or room air (21% O-2, 'control' group) from postnatal day 4-14 (P4-14); the rat pups were housed in room air between P14 and P28. At P28, they were sacrificed, and their lungs, brain, and eyes were extracted. Hematoxylin and eosin staining was performed on lung and brain sections; retinas were stained with Toluidine Blue. Hyperoxia exposure resulted in an increased mean linear intercept in the lungs (P<0.0001). This increase was associated with a decrease in some brain structures [especially the whole-brain surface (P=0.02)], as well as a decrease in the thickness of the retinal layers [especially the total retina (P=0.0008)], compared to the room air control group. In addition, a significant negative relationship was observed between the lung structures and the brain (r=-0.49, P=0.02) and retina (r=-0.70, P=0.0008) structures. In conclusion, hyperoxia exposure impaired lung, brain, and retina structures. More severe lung injuries correlated with more severe brain and retinal injuries. This result suggests that the same animal model of chronic neonatal hyperoxia can be used to simultaneously study lung, brain and retinal injuries related to hyperoxia.
