The regulation of neuronal RNA-binding proteins is therefore currently receiving attention. Sam68 is a ubiquitous nuclear RNA-binding protein implicated in post-transcriptional processes such as signal-dependent splice site selection. We show that Sam68 undergoes activity-responsive translocation to the soma and dendrites of hippocampal neurons in primary culture. In unstimulated neurons transiently expressing a GFP-Sam68 fusion protein, 90% of the cells accumulated the protein exclusively in the nucleus, and 4% showed extension of GFP-Sam68 to the dendrites. This nuclear expression pattern required the integrity of the Sam68 N-terminus. When present, the dendritic GFP-Sam68 formed granules, 26% of which were colocalized with ethidium bromide-stained RNA clusters. Most of the GFP-Sam68 granules were completely stationary, but a few moved in either a retrograde or anterograde direction. Following depolarization by 25 mM KCl, 50% of neurons displayed dendritic GFP-Sam68. GFP-Sam68 invaded the dendrites after 2 hours with high KCl, and returned to the nucleus within 3 hours after termination of the KCl treatment. A control GFP fusion derived from the SC-35 splicing factor remained fully nuclear during depolarization. No significant change was observed in the phosphorylation of Sam68 after depolarization. Translocation of Sam68 to the distal dendrites was microtubule dependent. Blockade of calcium channels with nimodipine abolished the translocation. Furthermore, inhibition of CRM-1-mediated nuclear export by leptomycin B partially prevented the depolarization-induced nuclear efflux of GFP-Sam68. These results support the possible involvement of Sam68 in the activity-dependent regulation of dendritic mRNAs.

J	Kohler, S; Paus, T; Buckner, RL; Milner, B				Kohler, S; Paus, T; Buckner, RL; Milner, B			Effects of left inferior prefrontal stimulation on episodic memory formation: A two-stage fMRI-rTMS study	JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; FRONTAL-CORTEX; CORTICAL STIMULATION; BRAIN; TASK; CONNECTIVITY; ACTIVATION; ATTENTION; RETRIEVAL	Successful recovery of words from episodic memory relies strongly on semantic processes at the time of encoding. Evidence from several functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies has shown that changes in neural activity in the left inferior prefrontal cortex (LIPFC) during semantic encoding predict subsequent memory performance. This evidence has been taken to suggest that LIPFC plays a critical role in memory formation. Functional neuroimaging findings, however, do not establish a causal brain-behavior relationship. To determine whether there is a causal link between LIPFC involvement at encoding and subsequent success in memory performance, we conducted a two-part study in which we first used fMRI to localize encoding-related activation in LIPFC and then employed repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to manipulate neural processes in LIPFC during semantic encoding. To demonstrate the neuroanatomical specificity of any observed effect and to control for nonspecific rTMS side effects, we also stimulated neural processes in two control sites. Using frameless stereotaxy, we positioned the stimulation coil to target (1) the LIPF region that was activated during fMRI (mean xyz = -48 35 5); (2) the homologous right-hemisphere region; and (3) an additional left parietal control site. At each site, "stimulated" items (600 msec of 7-Hz rTMS with Cadwell Round Coil) were intermixed with items presented without concurrent stimulation. Subsequently, subjects performed a recognition memory task for the words encountered. We found support for the predicted causal brain-behavior relationship, which was specific to LIPFC. When comparing recognition scores for stimulated items, normalized for variations in performance on nonstimulated trials, we found that words encoded under LIPFC stimulation were subsequently recognized with higher accuracy than words encoded under stimulation in the two cortical control sites. By contrast, no performance difference emerged when the two control sites were compared with each other. Based on additional analyses of the rTMS effects observed directly at the time of encoding (i.e., on semantic-decision performance), we suggest that LIPFC stimulation may have produced its effect on recognition memory, at least in part, through the triggering of more extensive processing Of the stimulated items and an ensuing gain in item distinctiveness. Physiological processes of facilitation probably also contributed to the observed memory benefit. Together, these findings suggest that LIPFC does play a causal role in episodic memory formation.

Under general anesthesia, a homogenous suspension of UM-MB1 cells (10(5)/10 mul) were injected in the caudoputamen nuclei of the right cerebral hemisphere using a stereotaxic apparatus. The treatment group (n = 9) received 10 mul of a bFGF solution (20 mug/ml) at 3 and 6 days following the inoculation of the cells at the injection site using the same stereotaxic coordinates. The control group (n = 9) were injected intracranially with a phosphate-buffered saline vehicle using a similar protocol. Mice were sacrificed 3 weeks following the xenograft surgery and the brains were prepared for histological observations as well as tumor volume evaluations. The mean volume of bFGF-treated tumors (mean volume +/- SD = 50.0 +/- 32.9 mm(3)) was significantly smaller than for the non-treated xenografts (mean volume +/- SD = 199.0 +/- 42.1 mm(3)) (t-test, p < 0.001). Compared to non-treated tumor cells, bFGF-treated medulloblastoma cells had a greater cytoplasm volume and their nuclei contained more euchromatin suggesting that bFGF may initiate differentiation. In conclusion, our results suggest that bFGF may offer a new chemotherapeutic modality for the treatment of medulloblastoma.

To identify the basis of such a phenotype, we have examined the expression of the three recently identified vesicular glutamate transporters (VGLUT1-3) in postnatal rat dopamine neurons in culture. We found that the majority of isolated dopamine neurons express VGLUT2, but not VGLUT1 or 3. In comparison, serotonin neurons express only VGLUT3. Single-cell RT-PCR experiments confirmed the presence of VGLUT2 mRNA in dopamine neurons. Arguing for phenotypic heterogeneity among axon terminals, we find that only a proportion of terminals established by dopamine neurons are VGLUT2-positive. Taken together, our results provide a basis for the ability of dopamine neurons to release glutamate as a cotransmitter. A detailed analysis of the conditions under which DA neurons gain or loose a glutamatergic phenotype may provide novel insight into pathophysiological processes that underlie diseases such as schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease and drug dependence.

Samples derived from normal animals and those subjected to monocular enucleation (ME) were hybridized to human Affymetrix HG-U95Av(2) oligonucleotide microarrays (N = 12) and the results were independently validated by real-time quantitative RT-PCR. To identify genes exhibiting significant expression differences among our samples, the microarray hybridization data were processed with two software packages that use different analytical models (Affymetrix MicroArray Suite 5.0, dChip 1.2). We identified 108 transcripts within diverse functional categories that differed in their visual cortical expression at the height of the critical period when compared to adults. The expression levels of four transcripts were also globally modulated following ME during the critical period. These transcripts are particularly sensitive to ME during the critical period but are not significantly modulated in ME adults. Three of the ME-driven genes (NGFI-B, egr3, NARP) are known immediate-early genes (IEG) while the other (DUSP6) is a phosphatase that can regulate IEG expression. The putative biological significance of the ME-driven and developmentally regulated genes is discussed with respect to the critical period for activity-dependent visual cortical neuroplasticity.

In Experiment 1, 37 first language (L1) English speakers varying in second language (L2, French) proficiency made living/non-living judgments to English and French nouns in lists blocked by language. Sixty critical words were each presented twice, once primed by a semantic associate in the preceding trial (e.g. ADULT, CHILD) and once unprimed (e.g. RABBIT, CHILD). Measures of response time (RT) and intra-individual variability in response time (coefficient of variation, CV) were obtained. The CV provided an index of processing efficiency that has been related to automaticity. Participants performed faster and with lower CVs (i.e. with greater efficiency) in L1 than L2, and the more highly proficient bilinguals had lower CVs than the less proficient bilinguals. Experiment 2 replicated these results with 29 participants and provided an electrical brain activity measure of processing efficiency using the N400 ERP. The similar pattern of results obtained between the behavioural and N400 ERP CV measures supported the idea that the CV measure of electrical brain activity can provide useful information about the automaticity or efficiency of cognitive processing.

We demonstrate that enhanced expression of adhesion molecule ICAM-1 and production of chemokines CXCL10/IP-10, CCL2/MCP-1, and CXCL8/IL-8 by HBECs induced by supernatants derived from allogeneic or myelin basic protein-reactive Th1 cells is only partially reversed with anti-IFNgamma antibody. This effect is not reproduced with IFNgamma or TNFalpha alone, implicating the interaction of multiple factors in the overall functional response. Supernatants from Th2 cells neither suppressed nor amplified Th1-induced effects. Although both Th1 and Th2 supernatants modulated the expression and localization of tight junction molecules zonula occludens (ZO)-1 and ZO-2, neither supernatant altered the permeability of HBEC monolayers to albumin or increased subsequent T cell migration rates. Prior migration of Th1 or Th2 cells across HBECs did enhance subsequent passage of cells and soluble molecules. Our results suggest that initial infiltration of either Th1 or Th2 polarized lymphocytes across the BBB contributes to the continuation of an inflammatory response in the central nervous system.

The device was equipped with load cells to measure both the grip and lifting or load forces. On selected blocks of 20 - 30 trials, a downward force-pulse perturbation was applied to the object after 1.5 s of stationary holding. The animals were required to resist the perturbation to obtain a fruit juice reward. The perturbations invariably elicited a reflex-like, time-locked increase in grip force at latencies between 50 and 100 ms. In this study, we searched for single cells in the interpositus and dentate nuclei with activity related to grasping and lifting, and we tested 127/150 task-related cells for their responses to the perturbation. Of the 127 cells, reflex-like increases or decreases in discharge frequency occurred in 75 cells (59%) at a mean latency of 36 ms. Preparatory increases in grip force preceding the perturbation appeared gradually and increased in strength with repetition in 39/127 (31%) cells. These preparatory increases did not immediately disappear when the perturbations were withdrawn but decreased progressively over repeated trials. Although a few cells showed anticipatory activity without a reflex-like response (15/127 or 12%), the majority of these cells (24/39) displayed both anticipatory and reflex-like responses. From an examination of the histological sections, cells with both anticipatory and reflex-like responses appeared to be confined to the dorsal anterior interpositus, adjacent to, but not within, the dentate nucleus. These results confirm and extend the suggestion by Dugas and Smith that the cerebellum plays a major role in organizing anticipatory responses to predictable perturbations in a manner that medial and lateral premotor areas of the cerebral cortex do not.

Some aspects of this cognitive dysfunction are the result of abnormal characteristics in the semantic processes of patients. These abnormalities exist not only at the discourse production level, but at the discourse comprehension level as well. The recording and analysis of event-related potentials has greatly advanced the investigation of the processing of linguistic information. One particular component of event-related potentials, N400, indexes semantic processing. Whereas all meaningful words elicit an N400, the amplitude of this component is much greater in response to words that are unexpected in a given context. As such, it is thought to reflect processes involved in contextual integration, which is the key to correct comprehension. N400 has been found to be abnormal in patients with schizophrenia when compared with healthy controls and, thus, may point toward the underlying cause of semantic deficits of patients with thought disorder.

We also explored the ability of neuropsychological (delayed verbal memory), neuroanatomical (MRI-based hippocampal volume), and electrophysiological (memory search P300 amplitude) memory measures to distinguish between the three subject groups using discriminant function analyses. Fourteen patients with DAT, 16 with MCI, and 15 age- and education-matched controls were tested. P300 amplitude was reduced in DAT subjects at all levels of memory load; however, it did not differ between MCI and control subjects. Delayed verbal memory performance best discriminated DAT from MCI and control subjects, while delayed verbal memory and hippocampal volume best discriminated MCI subjects from controls. These results support the utility of neuropsychological and neuroanatomical measures in diagnosing dementia and do not support the notion that P300 amplitude is sensitive to mild memory dysfunction when measured using the current task.

In particular, the analysis of singing performance in brain-damaged patients provides key information regarding the autonomy of music processing relative to language processing. Here, we review the relevant literature, mostly on the perception and memory of text and tunes in songs, and we illustrate how lyrics can be distinguished from melody in singing, in the case of brain damage. We report a new case, G.D., who has a severe speech disorder, marked by phonemic errors and stuttering, without a concomitant musical production disorder. G.D. was found to produce as few intelligible words in speaking as in singing familiar songs. Singing "la, la, la" was intact and hence could not account for the speech deficit observed in singing. The results indicate that verbal production, be it sung or spoken, is mediated by the same (impaired) language output system and that this speech route is distinct from the (spared) melodic route. In sum, we provide here further evidence that the autonomy of music and language processing extends to production tasks.

At present, this kinetic modeling technique does not allow for the estimation of the errors on the parameters. These estimates are useful when performing subsequent statistical analysis, such as, inference across a group of subjects or when applying partial volume correction algorithms. The difficulty with calculating the error estimates is a consequence of using an overcomplete dictionary of kinetic basis functions. In this paper, a bootstrap approach for the estimation of parameter errors from dynamic PET data is presented. This paper shows that the bootstrap can be used successfully to compute parameter errors on a region of interest or parametric image basis. Validation studies evaluate the methods performance on simulated and measured PET data ([C-11]Diprenorphine-opiate receptor and [C-11]Raclopride-dopamine D-2 receptor). The method is presented in the context of PET neuroreceptor binding studies, however, it has general applicability to a wide range of PET/SPET radiotracers in neurology, oncology and cardiology.

In this review, the ISAT report was analyzed critically and the available literature was scrutinized stratifying the common criticisms as to the weak aspects of this study. The aim of ISAT was to compare the safety and efficacy of endovascular coiling with neurosurgical clipping for aneurysms, which were suitable for both treatments. The results showed a 22.5% relative and 6.9% absolute risk reduction at one year in the disability outcome of patients who were treated with coiling. However, long-term risk of re-bleeding from the treated aneurysms and the risk of repeat procedures was higher in this group also. Lack of angiographic data following the initial treatment and long-term follow-up represents one of the main flaws of this study. The outcome assessment scale, biases regarding patient selection and center participation criteria were further issues of criticism. The results of ISAT are not sufficient to provide a definitive answer as to the superiority of endovascular treatment over microsurgery, although coiling appears to produce less periprocedural morbidity in a selected group of patients. An optimum outcome assessment should include a universally accepted scale and a detailed long-term angiographic outcome.

Manganese compounds emitted from the tailpipe of vehicles using methylcyclopentadienyl manganese tricarbonyl (MMT) are primarily Mn phosphate, Mn sulfate, and Mn phosphate/ sulfate mixture. The purpose of this study is to compare the patterns of Mn distribution in various brain regions (olfactory bulb, frontal parietal cortex, globus pallidus, striatum and cerebellum) and other tissues (lung, liver kidney, testis) and the neurobehavioral damage following inhalation exposure of rats to three Mn species. Rats (n = 15 rats per Mn species) were exposed 6 h per day, 5 days per week for 13 consecutive weeks to metallic Mn, Mn phosphate or Mn phosphate/ sulfate mixture at about 3000 mug m(-3) and compared to controls. At the end of the exposure period, spontaneous motor activity was measured for 36 h using a computerized autotrack system. Mn in tissues was determined by instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA). The Mn concentrations in the brain were significantly higher in rats exposed to Mn phosphate and Mn phosphate/sulfate mixture than in control rats or rats exposed to metallic Mn. Exposure to Mn phosphate/sulfate mixture caused a decrease in the total ambulatory count related to locomotor activity. Our results confirm that Mn species and solubility have an influence on the brain distribution of Mn in rats. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Breathing pure oxygen (O-2) or carbogen is known to have differential effects on the retinal and choroidal blood flow. Our objective was to evaluate the effects these hemodynamic changes have on various retinal neurons receiving their vital nutrients from these two vascular beds. To that effect, we recorded the photopic flash electroretinogram (fERG) and oscillatory potentials (OP's) in man. Methods. Eighteen adults participated in two test sessions to examine the effects of breathing pure O-2 or carbogen on the fERG's and OP's. The retinal potentials were recorded at the end of each of the following breathing phases: (1) room air for 5 min, (2) pure O-2 or carbogen for 5 min, (3) immediately after the flow of gas was stopped, and (4) 10 min after the flow of gas was stopped. The heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation (Sao(2)), and end-tidal carbon dioxide (Etco(2)) were monitored. The blood pressure and intraocular pressure were measured to derive the ocular perfusion pressure. Results. Breathing pure O-2 increased Sao(2), decreased heart rate and Etco(2), but did not alter respiratory rate and ocular perfusion pressure. Breathing carbogen increased Sao(2), Etco(2), and ocular perfusion pressure, decreased respiratory rate but did not alter heart rate. The fERGs and OP's were not detrimentally affected by breathing either pure oxygen or carbogen. Only OP4 was delayed at the end of testing in the O-2 session. Conclusion. Our results show that the neural generators of the photopic fERG's and OP's in man are largely unaltered by the degree of systemic hyperoxia and hypercapnia induced and their reported effects on retinal and choroidal hemodynamics. These results, combined with earlier studies showing that some components of the scotopic fERG's and OP's were altered during similar testing conditions, suggest that the photopic system is more resistant than the scotopic system to altered ocular hemodynamics.

However, they seem unsatisfactory to target efficiently all children who will manifest long-term neurologic sequelae and eventually require rehabilitation services. The updated version of the Amiel-Tison's Neurological Assessment At Term (ATNAAT) is expected to allow a better prediction of the neurodevelopmental outcome in high-risk infants. The main objective of the present study, which was performed on 35 infants, was to analyze the interobserver reliability of the updated version of ATNAAT. The evaluator and the observer coded the items of the test simultaneously. Among the 35 items tested, 16 demonstrated an excellent reliability based on the kappa coefficient, 11 items yielded a fair to good reliability, whereas only two items produced an agreement below 0.40. The final synthesis, which was a global appreciation of the neurologic status based on the different findings, yielded a good reliability with a kappa coefficient of 0.76. Among the infants who had a nonoptimal outcome from the assessment, only 38.5% met the traditional criteria currently used for follow-up. It would be important to conduct further research on predictive validity to demonstrate the capacity of the ATNAAT to forecast the long-term neurologic outcome of infants at risk.

Seventy-two healthy subjects performed a forced-choice odor detection task in one of three conditions: after being told to imagine an odor (odor imagery), after being told to imagine an object (visual imagery), or without having received imagery instructions (no-imagery control). For the two imagery conditions, the presented and imagined stimuli were either the same (matched) or different (mismatched). There was a significant difference between detection in the matched and mismatched conditions for odor imagery, but not for visual imagery. We conclude that our paradigm does measure odor imagery and that the effect of imagery on detection is both content- and modality-specific. Further, the difference between conditions was due to lower detection with mismatched odor imagery than without imagery, indicating that interference underlies the effect.

Animal studies of short-term progesterone administration and withdrawal model the natural increase and abrupt decrease in progesterone levels which occur in the late luteal phase (LP) of the human menstrual cycle (MC). Previously, studies in animals have shown that abrupt cessation of chronic or short-term progesterone administration results in pharmacological changes at the GABA(A) receptor, resulting in altered sensitivity to GABA(A) receptor neuromodulators such as benzodiazepines and flumazenil, a GABA(A) receptor antagonist. Objectives. This study's goal was to compare the response to flumazenil in the follicular phase (FP) and late LP in female healthy controls (HCs). We postulated that HC females would exhibit a greater psychological and somatic response to flumazenil in the late LP, a period of progesterone withdrawal, compared to the FP. Methods. Twelve healthy females, without history of psychiatric disorder, were randomized to receive two injections of a 2 mg bolus injection of flumazenil (one in the late LP and one in the FP) and two injections of placebo (one in the late LP and one in the FP). Following injection, subjects were asked to rate the occurrence and intensity of panic symptoms on the panic symptom scale (PSS). Results. A main treatment effect was detected for the PSS score response after flumazenil injection (P=0.008). However, there was no significant treatment-by-phase interaction observed (P=0.449). Conclusions. These findings indicate that MC phase did not affect the response to flumazenil in HC females. This result is contrary to our hypothesis of altered sensitivity to flumazenil in the late LP.

We hypothesized that Alpha power decreases during both Stage 2 and REM sleep would index the presence of sleep mentation in these stages. Absolute power for six classical EEG bands and three Alpha subbands was calculated for Stage 2 and REM sleep awakenings both with and without mentation recall. In both stages, recall was associated with lower Alpha power, especially with middle Alpha power (9.5-11.5 Hz). Unexpectedly, a similar effect for Delta power (0.5-4.0 Hz) was also observed. The Alpha effect may reflect cognitive elaboration active in the minutes preceding awakening; however, attention and memory processes cannot be excluded. The Delta effect is consistent with prior observations of regular linkages between Alpha and Delta power during sleep.

J	Zwingmann, C; Chatauret, N; Rose, C; Leibfritz, D; Butterworth, RF				Zwingmann, C; Chatauret, N; Rose, C; Leibfritz, D; Butterworth, RF			Selective alterations of brain osmolytes in acute liver failure: protective effect of mild hypothermia	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						acute liver failure; brain edema; encephalopathy; glutamine; hypothermia; organic osmolyte	FULMINANT HEPATIC-FAILURE; AMINO-ACIDS; PORTACAVAL ANASTOMOSIS; MAGNETIC-RESONANCE; INTRACRANIAL HYPERTENSION; CELL-VOLUME; AMMONIA; EDEMA; GLUTAMINE; RATS	The principal cause of mortality in patients with acute liver failure (ALF) is brain herniation resulting from intracranial hypertension caused by a progressive increase of brain water. In the present study, ex vivo high-resolution H-1-NNM spectroscopy was used to investigate the effects of ALF, with or without superimposed hypothermia, on brain organic osmolyte concentrations in relation to the severity of encephalopathy and brain edema in rats with ALF due to hepatic devascularization. In normothermic ALF rats, glutamine concentrations in frontal cortex increased more than fourfold at precoma stages, i.e. prior to the onset of severe encephalopathy, but showed no further increase at coma stages. In parallel with glutamine accumulation, the brain organic osmolytes myo-inositol and taurine were significantly decreased in frontal cortex to 63% and 67% of control values, respectively, at precoma stages (p<0.01), and to 58% and 67%, respectively, at coma stages of encephalopathy (p<0.01). Hypothermia, which prevented brain edema and encephalopathy in ALF rats, significantly attenuated the depletion of myo-inositol and taurine. Brain glutamine concentrations, on the other hand, did not respond to hypothermia. These findings demonstrate that experimental ALF results in selective changes in brain organic osmolytes as a function of the degree of encephalopathy which are associated with brain edema, and provides a further rationale for the continued use of hypothermia in the management of this condition.

We report nuclear expression as a characteristic of these receptors, including a nuclear localization for the apelin receptor in brain and cerebellum-derived D283 Med cells and the AT(1) and bradykinin B-2 receptors in HEK-293T cells. Immunocytochemical analyses revealed the apelin receptor with localization in neuronal nuclei in cerebellum and hypothalamus, exhibiting expression in neuronal cytoplasm or in both nuclei and cytoplasm. Confocal microscopy of HEK-293T cells revealed the majority of transfected cells displayed constitutive nuclear localization of AT(1) and B-2 receptors, whereas apelin receptors did not show nuclear localization in these cells. The majority of apelin receptor-transfected cerebellum D283 Med cells showed receptor nuclear expression. Immunoblot analyses of subcellular-fractionated D283 Med cells demonstrated endogenous apelin receptor species in nuclear fractions. In addition, an identified nuclear localization signal motif in the third intracellular loop of the apelin receptor was disrupted by a substituted glutamine in place of lysine. This apelin receptor (K242Q) did not exhibit nuclear localization in D283 Med cells. These results demonstrate the following: (i) the apelin receptor exhibits nuclear localization in human brain; (ii) distinct cell-dependent mechanisms for the nuclear transport of apelin, AT(1), and B-2 receptors; and (iii) the disruption of a nuclear localization signal sequence disrupts the nuclear translocation of the apelin receptor. This discovery of apelin, AT(1), and B-2 receptors with agonist-independent nuclear translocation suggests major unanticipated roles for these receptors in cell signaling and function.

To investigate the potential role of amphiphysin II in cellular trafficking of G protein-coupled somatostatin (SRIF) receptors, we generated an AtT-20 cell line stably overexpressing amphiphysin IIb, a splice variant that does not bind clathrin. Endocytosis of I-125-[D-Trp(8)]SRIF was not affected by amphiphysin IIb overexpression. However, the maximal binding capacity (B-max) of the ligand on intact cells was significantly lower in amphiphysin IIb overexpressing than in non-transfected cells. This difference was no longer apparent when the experiments were performed on crude cell homogenates, suggesting that amphiphysin IIb overexpression interferes with SRIF receptor targeting to the cell surface and not with receptor synthesis. Accordingly, immunofluorescence experiments demonstrated that, in amphiphysin overexpressing cells, sst(2A) and sst(5) receptors were segregated in a juxtanuclear compartment identified as the trans-Golgi network. Amphiphysin IIb overexpression had no effect on corticotrophin-releasing factor 41-stimulated adrenocorticotropic hormone secretion, suggesting that it is not involved in the regulated secretory pathway. Taken together, these results suggest that amphiphysin II is not necessary for SRIF receptor endocytosis but is critical for its constitutive targeting to the plasma membrane. Therefore, amphiphysin IIb may be an important component of the constitutive secretory pathway.

Recent studies have reported that disruption of Exon IV produces a null mouse lacking all p75NTR gene products (p75NTR(ExonIV-/-)), whereas mice lacking p75NTR Exon III (p75NTR(ExonIII-/-)) maintain expression of an alternatively spliced form of p75NTR (s-p75NTR). Here, we report that p75NTR(ExonIV-/-) mice express a p75NTR gene product that encodes a truncated protein containing the extracellular stalk region together with the entire transmembrane and intracellular domains. The gene product is initiated from a cryptic Kozak consensus/initiator ATG sequence within a region of Exon IV located 3' to the pGK-Neo insertion site. Overexpression of this fragment in heterologous cells results in activation of Jun kinase and induces Pro-caspase- 3 cleavage, indicating that it activates p75NTR signaling cascades. These results indicate that aspects of the p75NTR(ExonIV-/-) phenotype may reflect a gain-of-function mutation rather than loss of p75NTR function.

Excitotoxic lesions of the prefrontal cortex were made by injecting bilaterally at three anterior-posterior placements 2 mug/mul of ibotenic acid. Ten days after surgery, locomotor responses to an intracerebroventricular injection of 0.18 or 18 nmol/10 mul Of D-Tyr[(11)]neurotensin, or vehicle-saline, were measured in different groups of lesioned and sham rats. Ambulatory, non-ambulatory and vertical movements were measured for 2 h in activity cages starting immediately after the injection. This training phase was repeated on four occasions, every second day. One week after the last day of the training phase (day 14), locomotor responses to a single injection of amphetamine (0.75 mg/kg, IP) were measured in all rats. Results show that D-Tyr[(11)]neurotensin produced in sham animals a dose-dependent initial suppression of locomotor activity followed by an augmentation. The latter behavioral effect tended to be smaller in the lesioned rats, but not statistically different than in sham, suggesting that prefrontal cortex neurons do not play a major role in the stimulant effect of neurotensin on locomotor activity. However, sham rats pre-exposed to the high dose Of D-Tyr[(11)]neurotensin showed stronger non-ambulatory and vertical movements than saline pre-exposed rats when tested with amphetamine; this sensitization effect was not observed in lesioned rats. The present results show that prefrontal cortex neurons are part of the neural circuitry involved in the development of amphetamine sensitization by repeated activation of central neurotensin receptors.

We demonstrate here that, when the inhibitory rho1/GABA and the excitatory P2X(2) receptor channels are co-expressed in Xenopus oocytes, activation of one channel reduces the currents mediated by the other one. This reciprocal inhibitory cross-talk is a receptor-mediated phenomenon independent of agonist cross-modulation, membrane potential, direction of ionic flux, or channel densities. Functional interaction is disrupted when the cytoplasmic C-terminal domain of P2X(2) is deleted or in competition experiments with minigenes coding for the C-terminal domain of P2X(2) or the main intracellular loop of rho1 subunits. We also show a physical interaction between P2X(2) and rho1 receptors expressed in oocytes and the co-clustering of these receptors in transfected hippocampal neurons. Co-expression with P2X(2) induces retargeting and recruitment of mainly intracellular rho1/ GABA receptors to surface clusters. Therefore, molecular and functional cross-talk between inhibitory and excitatory ligand-gated channels may regulate synaptic strength both by activity-dependent current occlusion and synaptic receptors co-trafficking.

Because neurotrophins are a family of growth factors that support neuronal survival, we hypothesized that quantitative and qualitative changes in neurotrophins or their receptors may take place early in ocular hypertension, preceding extensive cell death and clinical features of glaucoma. We present molecular, biochemical, and phenotypic evidence that significant neurotrophic changes occur in retina, which correlate temporally with retinal ganglion cell death. After 7 days of ocular hypertension there is a transient up-regulation of retinal NGF, while its receptor TrkA is up-regulated in a sustained fashion in retinal neurons. After 28 days of ocular hypertension there is sustained up-regulation of retinal BDNF, but its receptor TrkB remains unchanged. Throughout, NT-3 levels remain unchanged but there is an early and sustained increase of its receptor TrkC in Muller cells but not in retinal ganglion cells. These newly synthesized glial TrkC receptors are truncated, kinase-dead isoforms. Expression of retinal p75 also increases late at day 28. Asymmetric up-regulation of neurotrophins and neurotrophin receptors may preclude efficient neurotrophic rescue of RGCs from apoptosis. A possible rationale for therapeutic intervention with Trk receptor agonists and p75 receptor antagonists is proposed. (C) 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Neurobiol 58: 341-354, 2004.

Alterations in the noradrenergic system have been observed in postmortem brain studies of suicide victims when compared to controls. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that genetic variants of the alpha(2A) adrenergic receptor gene are implicated in suicide and/or have a modulatory effect on personality traits that are believed to mediate suicidal behavior. We studied a sample of suicides (N = 110) and control subjects (N = 130) for genetic variation at four loci, including three in the promoter region (g-1800t, c-1291 g and the g-261a) of the alpha(2A) adrenergic receptor gene, and a potentially functional locus, N251K, which leads to an amino acid change (asparagine to lysine). No significant differences were observed at the promoter loci in terms of allelic or genotypic distribution between suicides and controls. However, analysis of the functional polymorphism N251K revealed that the 251 K allele was only present among suicides, though only three suicide cases had this allele, two of which were homozygous. These results are preliminary. If confirmed, they suggest that variation at the alpha(2A) adrenergic receptor gene may play a role in a small proportion of suicide cases.

In the present study, we examined the i.c.v. cardiovascular effects of several tachykinin receptor antagonists in awake spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR, 15 weeks old). Results showed that two tachykinin NK3 receptor antagonists (R-820: 3-indolylcarbonyl-Hyp-Phg-N(Me)-Bzl and SB 222200: (S)-( -)-N-(alpha-ethylbenzyl)-3-methyl-2-phenylquinoline-4-carboxamide) caused a sustained and dose-dependent reduction of blood pressure when injected i.c.v. but not i.v. The stereoselective anti-hypertensive effect of SB 222200 peaked at 3 h and faded at 6 h post-injection (if injected at 07:00 h) or had a slower onset and peaked at 8 h post-injection (if injected at 13:00 h). The effect of R-820 was maximal at 24 h and lasted up to 48 h post-injection. Both antagonists failed to alter blood pressure in normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY) and heart rate was not affected in both strains. The anti-hypertensive effect of SB 222200 was not associated with changes in plasma levels of catecholamines and vasopressin and it remained unchanged in SHR subjected to acute bilateral nephrectomy. In contrast, blood pressure was not affected by tachykinin NK1 (RP 67580: (+/-) 7,7-diphenyl-2[1-imino-2(2-methoxy-phenyl)-ethyl]perhydroisoindol-4-one(3aR,7aR)) and NK2 (SR 48968: (S)-N-methyl-N[4-(4-acetylamino-4-phenylpiperidino)-2-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)butyl]benzamide) receptor antagonists. Data suggest that brain tachykinin NK3 receptorsare implicated in the maintenance of hypertension in SHR. Hence, these receptors may represent promising therapeutic target in the treatment of arterial hypertension. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All fights reserved.

In neurodegenerative disorders, its putative deregulation, featured by inflammation and activation of glial cells resulting from inherited mutations or viral/bacterial infections, likely contributes to neuronal death. However, it remains unclear to what extent environmental factors and innate immunity cooperate to modulate the interactions between the neuronal and non-neuronal elements in the perturbed CNS. In the present study, we addressed the effects of acute and chronic administration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a Gram-negative bacterial wall component, in a genetic model of neurodegeneration. Transgenic mice expressing a mutant form of the superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1(G37R)) linked to familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis were challenged intraperitoneally with a single nontoxic or repeated injections of LPS (1 mg/kg). At different ages, SOD1(G37R) mice responded normally to acute endotoxemia. Remarkably, only a chronic challenge with LPS in presymptomatic 6-month-old SOD1(G37R) mice exacerbated disease progression by 3 weeks and motor axon degeneration. Closely associated with the severity of disease is the stronger and restricted upregulation of the receptor of innate immunity Toll-like receptor 2 and proinflammatory cytokines in degenerating regions of the ventral spinal cord and efferent fiber tracts of the brain from the LPS-treated SOD1(G37R) mice. This robust immune response was not accompanied by the establishment of acquired immunity. Our results provide solid evidence that environmental factors and innate immunity can cooperate to influence the course of disease of an inherited neuropathology.

Timed-pregnant rats were given an intraperitoneal injection of 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU), a marker of cell proliferation, on designated days between embryonic day 12 (E12) and E21. CR-inummoreactive (-IR) neurons and BrdU-positive nuclei were labeled in the adult neostriatum by double inummohistochemistry, and:the proportion of double-labeled cells was quantified. CR-IR interneurons of the neostriatum show maximum birth rates (>10% double labeling) between E14 and E17, with a peak at E15. CR-IR interneurons occupying the lateral half of the neostriatum become postmitotic prior to medial neurons. In the precomissural neostriatum, the earliest-born neurons occupy the lateral quadrants and the latest-born neurons occupy the dorsomedial sector. No significant rostrocaudal neurogenesis gradient is observed. CR-IR neurons make up 0.5% of the striatal population and are localized in both the patch and the matrix compartments. CR-IR neurons of the patch compartment are born early (E13-15), with later-born neurons (E16-18) populating mainly the matrix compartment. CR-IR cells of the neostriatum are a distinct subclass of interneurons that are born at an intermediate time during striatal development and share common neurogenesis characteristics with other interneurons and projection neurons produced in the ventral telencephalon.

Evoked and spontaneous field potentials were recorded from the deep layers of neocortical slices during GABA(A) receptor blockade by bicuculline methiodide (BMI, 50 muM). The anticholinesterase eserine (10 muM) as well as the ACh-analog carbamylcholine chloride (CCh, 25 muM) decreased the amplitude and duration of evoked field potentials and in parallel, increased significantly the rate of occurrence of spontaneous discharges. These effects were reversed by the muscarinic antagonist atropine (2.5 muM, n = 20), but not by the nicotinic receptor antagonist hexamethonium (50 muM, n = 3). The M1 subtype-selective muscarinic antagonist pirenzepine (1 muM, n = 12) blocked spontaneous discharges in 8/12 slices, while muscarinic antagonists of the M2 (AFDX 116 n = 4), M3 (4-DAMP n = 4) and M4 (gallamine n = 5, tropicamide n = 6) type, all at 1 muM, only reduced their frequency. CCh-induced spontaneous discharges were blocked by the combination of the glutamate receptor antagonists AP5 and CNQX (both at 10 muM; n = 11). Gap junction blockers abolished them (halothane, n = 7) or reduced their frequency by 65% (carbenoxolone, n = 8). Inhibiting Ca2+ release from intracellular stores by dantrolene (100 muM, n = 5) or thapsigargin (1 muM, n = 5) also depressed their frequencies by 55 -65%. By contrast, their rates were not altered by perfusion with high Ca2+ (7 mM; n = 6) medium, a manipulation suppressing polysynaptic connections. These findings demonstrate that activation of muscarinic receptors, notably of the M1 type, in immature rat neocortex facilitates the generation of glutamatergic epileptiform discharges. These discharges are strongly inhibited by gap junction blockers, and are also partly mediated by the, presumably muscarinic receptor-dependent, mobilization of intracellular calcium.

Solid-phase syntheses of 1-3 were developed. The purities of the crude materials isolated from the resin tend to be highest for the S- and N-compounds 2 and 3 and better than in the corresponding syntheses of peptidomimetics A. The particular dipeptide units incorporated were chosen to correspond with the turn regions of the neurotrophins (e.g., nerve growth factor {NGF} and the neurotrophin factor-3 {NT-3}). Preliminary studies were performed to access the binding of these analogues to Trk receptors and their ability to induce cell survival (just as NGF and NT-3 do). Several active compounds were identified. However, poor water solubilities of some of the other compounds preclude reliable testing. Consequently, solid-phase modifications to the synthetic procedures were investigated to provide access to the derivatives 12-14 in which the aromatic nitro group is replaced by amine, guanidine, or sulfonamide functionalities. The latter are more acceptable pharmacophores than nitro groups and also tend to increase the water solubilities of the peptidomimetics.

Particularly, we focused on the influence of the valence dimension on the cognitive processing triggered by a non emotional oddball task. To this end, event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded from 25 sites during a visual oddball paradigm. Three sets of pictures (unpleasant, neutral and pleasant) with low arousal values served as rare target items. Subjects were simply asked to realize a standard/target categorization task, irrespective of the picture valence. A temporal principal component analysis allowed us to identify several evoked components (i.e. P1, P2, N2, P3a and P3b). Emotional effects observed on PI, P2 and P3b showed that the valence content of the stimulus modulates the cognitive processes at several points in the information processing stream.

Study design: This was a cohort study of women with epilepsy (n = 414 women) who were delivered in a tertiary referral center (1978-2000). Outcomes were compared with women who did not have epilepsy (n = 81,759 women) who were delivered during the same period, with the use of t tests or contingency table analyses. Results: Comparison showed increased rates of nonproteinuric hypertension (P<.05), induction of labor (P<.001), and fetal cardiovascular malformations (P<.001) among women with epilepsy. Rates of other antenatal, intrapartum, and neonatal complications and congenital malformations were similar to those of control subjects. There were fewer instrumental vaginal deliveries. There were no live births with neural tube defects. The occurrence of major antepartum seizures did not increase the rate of adverse outcomes significantly. Major congenital malformations increased in proportion to the number of anticonvulsants that were prescribed. Conclusion: Women with epilepsy are not at increased risk for obstetric complications, provided that appropriate care is available during preconception, pregnancy, labor, delivery, and after delivery.

Phonomyography (PMG) consists of recording low-frequency sounds created during muscle contraction. In this study, we compared and used both methods to determine neuromuscular blockade (NMB) at the adductor pollicis muscle. In 14 patients, PMG was recorded via a small condenser microphone taped to the thenar mass, and a standard mechanomyographic device was applied to the same arm. In another group of 14 patients, only PMG was measured. After induction of anesthesia, the ulnar nerve was stimulated supramaximally using single twitch stimulation (0.1 Hz) for onset and train-of-four (TOF) stimulation every 12 s during offset of NMB produced by mivacurium 0.1 mg/kg. Onset and recovery indices measured by the 2 methods were compared using Student's t-test (P < 0.05). Similar comparisons were made between the two PMG groups (with or without special board). Agreement between PMG and MMG was examined using a Bland-Altman test. Onset was 165 (68) s versus 172 (67) s [mean (SD)], and maximum blockade was 89 (10)% versus 90 (11)%, for PMG and MMG respectively (NS). Time to 25%, 75%, and 90% recovery was 16.5 (4.2) min, 22.1 (6.9) min, and 24.5 (8.2) min, respectively for PMG, not different from 16.7 (4) min, 22.8 (8.1) min, and 24.8 (8.8) min for MMG. Mean bias was 0% with limits of agreement of - 10 and + 10% of twitch height for all signals (MMG minus PMG). Time to TOF of 0.5, 0.7, 0.8, and 0.9, was 1 min faster with PMG than with MMG, with limits of agreement of -1.5 to 3.5 min. Pharmacodynamic data derived without or with special arm fixation were not significantly different. MMG and PMG can be used interchangeably to determine NMB at the adductor pollicis muscle. PMG is easier to apply, does not need a special monitoring board and could be a reliable monitor to determine NMB in daily routine.

Listening to music and therapeutic suggestions were also studied, but mostly in awake patients, and these have a positive effect on postoperative recovery and the need for analgesia. In this study, we evaluated the effect of listening to music under general anesthesia on the neurohormonal response to surgical stress as measured by epinephrine, norepinephrine, cortisol, and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) blood levels. Thirty female patients scheduled for abdominal gynecological procedures were enrolled and randomly divided into two groups: group NM (no music) and group M (music). In group M, music was played from after the induction of anesthesia until the end of surgery. In the NM group, the patients wore the headphones but no music was played. We established three sample times for hormonal dosage during the procedure and one in the recovery room. Hemodynamic data were recorded at all times, and postoperative consumption of morphine in the first 24 h was noted. There was no group difference at any sample time or in the postoperative period in terms of mean arterial blood pressure, heart rate, isoflurane end-tidal concentration, time of the day at which the surgery was performed, bispectral index (BIS) value, doses of fentanyl, or consumption of postoperative morphine. There was no difference between the two groups with regard to plasmatic levels of norepinephrine, epinephrine, cortisol, or ACTH at any sample time, although the blood level of these hormones significantly increased in each group with surgical stimulation. In conclusion, we could not demonstrate a significant effect of intraoperative music on surgical stress when used under general anesthesia.

Anatomic and physiologic data show that multiple regions of the forebrain are activated by pain. However, the effect of anesthetic level on nociceptive input to these regions is not well understood. dMethods: The authors used positron emission tomography to measure the effect of various concentrations of propofol on pain-evoked changes in regional cerebral blood flow. Fifteen volunteers were scanned while warm and painful heat stimuli were presented to the volar forearm using a contact thermode during administration of target propofol concentrations of 0.0 mug/ml (alert control), 0.5 mug/ml (mild sedation), 1.5 mug/ml (moderate sedation), and 3.5 mug/ml (unconsciousness). Results: During the 0.5-mug/ml target propofol concentration (mild sedation), the subjects' pain ratings increased relative to the alert control condition; correspondingly, pain-evoked regional cerebral blood flow increased in the thalamus and the anterior cingulate cortex. In contrast, when subjects lost consciousness (3.5 mug/ml), pain-evoked responses in the thalamus and the anterior cingulate cortex were no longer observed, whereas significant pain-evoked activation remained in the insular cortex. Conclusion: These data show that propofol has a dose-dependent effect on thalamocortical transfer of nociceptive information but that some pain-evoked cortical activity remains after loss of consciousness.

This ability provides an opportunity to deliver real time marketing or services that strengthen customer relationships. This also enables an organization to gather business intelligence about a customer that can be used for future planning and programs. This paper presents a new algorithm for extracting accurate and comprehensible rules from databases via trained artificial neural network ( ANN) using genetic algorithm (GA). The new algorithm does not depend on the ANN training algorithms also it does not modify the training results. The GA is used to find the optimal values of input attributes ( chromosome), X-m, which maximize the output function psi(k) of output node k. The function psi(k) = f(x(i), (WG1)(i,j,) (WG2)(j,k)) is nonlinear exponential function. Where (WG1)(i,j), (WG2) (j,k) are the weights groups between input and hidden nodes, and hidden and output nodes, respectively. The optimal chromosome is decoded and used to get a rule belongs to class(k). (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

There is growing evidence that fatigue in MS has a central nervous system component. We hypothesized that diffuse cerebral axonal damage could be associated with fatigue and used proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy to non-invasively measure axonal damage or loss in the brains of patients with MS. Objective: To assess the strength of the relationship between central brain N-acetylaspartate and fatigue. Design: Data from 73 patients who had undergone proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy imaging and completed the Fatigue Severity Scale questionnaire were analyzed. Results: The N-acetylaspartate-creatine ratio (NAA/Cr) was significantly lower in the high-fatigue group than the low-fatigue group (mean +/-SD, 2.69+/-0.29 and 2.99+/-0.33, respectively. P=.003). Independent of the Kurtzke Expanded Disability Status Scale, T2 lesion volume, age, and disease duration, NAA/Cr was significantly lower in the high-fatigue group as compared with the low-fatigue group. There was a statistically significant linear correlation between the Fatigue Severity Scale scores and NAA/Cr (Spearman rank p=-0.361, P=.02). Conclusions: The results of this study, combined with those of others, suggest that widespread axonal dysfunction is associated with fatigue in MS. Increased recruitment of cortical areas and pathways in response to brain injury may be responsible for the patient's sense that the effort required to perform actions is disproportionately high.

Design: Before-after trial. Setting: Laboratory of a university-affiliated research rehabilitation center. Participants: A sample of 12 patients with stroke and 14 age- and Render-matched healthy subjects. Intervention: In a single session, patients were trained with combined mental and physical practice to increase the loading on the affected leg while standing up and sitting down. Main Outcome Measures: Motor improvement as measured by the percentage change in limb loading on the affected limb after training, and 24 hours later (follow-up), and the relationship between working memory and percentage motor improvement. Results: The loading on the affected leg was improved after training (P<.01) and at follow-up (P<.05), and working memory scores at follow-up correlated significantly (P<.004 to P<.007) with the level of improvement. The visuospatial domain yielded the strongest correlation (r=.83), followed by the verbal (r=.62) and kinesthetic (r=.59) domains. Conclusions: These results suggest that the outcome (improved limb loading) of mental rehearsal with motor imagery depends on the ability to maintain and manipulate information T in working memory.

Elevated levels of freezing in and active avoidance of the shock-paired compartment were observed, and memory for the appetitive task was improved when tested 24 hr later. Intra-amygdala muscimol injected before the posttraining exposure eliminated freezing, avoidance, and memory modulation. The blockade of both freezing and active avoidance, which involve competing behavioral tendencies, makes it unlikely that the amygdala itself generates either behavior. The elimination of conditioned memory modulation suggests that conditioned neurohormonal responses were blocked. These conditioned internal responses may comprise the intervening variable of "conditioned fear" and may promote observable behaviors, the form of which is determined by the environment in which they occur.

We hypothesized that individuals with low plasma GABA levels may be more prone to develop posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in the aftermath of trauma exposure. Methods: To test this hypothesis, we measured plasma GABA levels in a population of 108 road traffic accident victims on arrival at a traumatology department and assessed them for PTSD 6 weeks later. Results. The mean GABA level (nmol/mL) in the PTSD group (n = 55; M = .20; SD = .08) was significantly lower compared with members of the trauma-exposed group who did not develop PTSD [n = 17; M = .30; SD = .09), t(70) = 3.94, p = .0002]. Conclusions. Provided that GABA levels in the brain are genetically predetermined, our results would suggest that individuals with low plasma GABA levels are premorbidly more vulnerable to stress-related disorders such as acute PTSD. If replicated, plasma GABA levels measured in the aftermath of trauma exposure might help to identify individuals at high risk for developing PTSD.

The BCNs secrete a large amount of egg-laying hormone (ELH) in response to an electrical afterdischarge. The afterdischarge also triggers cellular and molecular events leading to upregulation of ELH biosynthesis to replenish the supply of releasable hormone that was lost because of secretion. in the present review, we discuss signal-transduction events that link membrane excitability to ELH biosynthesis. We present evidence that the afterdischarge stimulates ELH synthesis by upregulating translation of ELH mRNA rather than by activating ELH gene transcription. This increase in ELH synthesis is accompanied by a decrease in total protein synthesis, suggesting that the synthetic machinery is being funneled selectively toward ELH. We also discuss work showing that afterdischarge-induced ELH synthesis uses a novel mechanism of translation initiation, one involving a switch from cap-dependent to cap-independent translation initiation that activates an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) located in the 5'-untranslated region of ELH mRNA. The IRES-regulated translation provides a unique cellular mechanism to selectively upregulate synthesis of a critical reproductive hormone at the expense of nonessential proteins.

In this study, balloon pressure mechanomyography, a novel method to measure the force of contraction via pressure changes in an air-filled balloon, was compared with phonomyography to determine neuromuscular blockade at the corrugator supercilii muscle. Method: After approval of the Ethics Committee and informed consent, 15 patients were studied. A small condenser microphone was taped to the area just above the eyebrow for phonomyography; an air-filled balloon was taped to the area just above the opposite eyebrow. After induction of anesthesia using remifentanil and propofol, a laryngeal mask airway was inserted without the aid of neuromuscular blocking agents. The facial nerve was stimulated supramaximally with single-twitch stimulation (0.1 Hz) using superficial electrodes placed on both temporal areas for onset and train-of-four stimulation every 12 sec during offset of neuromuscular blockade produced by mivacurium 0.1 mg.kg(-1). Onset and recovery measured by the two methods were compared using the t test and agreement between phonomyography and balloon pressure mechanomyography was examined using the Bland-Altman method. Results: Onset, peak effect, and time to reach 25%, 75%, and 90% of control twitch response for phonomyography vs balloon pressure method were 83+/-16 sec vs 81+/-15 sec, 80+/-15% vs 82+/-17%, 7.7+/-2.3 min vs 7.5+/-2.4 min, 9.9+/-4.1 min vs 10.5+/-4 min, and 12.6+/-4.3 min vs 13.1+/-4.5 min respectively without being significantly different. Mean bias was 1% with limits of agreement of -9 and +9% of twitch height (TI). Conclusion: We applied a balloon pressure method to measure the force at the corrugator supercilii. Phonomyography at the corrugator supercilii shows good agreement with this modified version of mechanomyography.

Male hemizygotes are generally more severely affected than heterozygote females. Clinical disease in females is thought to be due to unequal X chromosome inactivation. Case: A 19-year-old woman, who was previously well, presented with neurological deficits secondary to basal ganglia and pontine infarction. Extensive cardiac, arterial and hematologic investigations did not identify the etiology of her stroke. Muscle biopsy revealed endothelial lysosomal aggregates most consistent with a diagnosis of Fabry's disease. The diagnosis was confirmed on the basis of molecular genotype analysis. Discussion: Inherited causes of stroke such as Fabry's disease should be considered in young patients with stroke if an etiologic diagnosis is not reached after complete investigations. Muscle biopsy can assist with the diagnosis and guide further investigations. This report summarizes the biochemical and histological features of Fabry's disease and the associated genetic abnormalities.

Results: Despite radiologic, intraoperative gross features, and frozen pathology all consistent with meningioma, the final pathology revealed metastatic renal cell carcinoma. Conclusion: Renal cell carcinoma metastatic to the choroid plexus can mimic intraventricular meningioma. We present a review of the literature and comparison of the radiological features of meningiomas and metastatic renal cell carcinoma. We also discuss the use of an under-utilized technique, the contralateral transcallosal approach, in the surgical treatment of this intraventricular lesion.

The present study provides functional evidence supporting this hypothesis by examining the effects of lesions to these structures on copulation, noncontact erection and receptive female preference. Sexually naive male Long-Evans rats received either bilateral 1.0-muL injections of NMDA (10 mug/muL/side) or vehicle (shams) into either the aLHA or the NAc. During repeated tests of copulation most of the sham-lesioned males, but few of the aLHA-lesioned and NAc-lesioned males, copulated to ejaculation. Most of the NAc-lesioned males also failed to intromit, whereas the majority of the aLHA-lesioned males intromitted repeatedly. During exposure to an inaccessible receptive female behind a wire-mesh screen, aLHA-lesioned males displayed facilitation of noncontact erections, whereas NAc-lesioned males displayed impaired noncontact erections. Conversely, during simultaneous exposure to inaccessible receptive and nonreceptive females in different compartments, all males spent more time in the proximity of the receptive female. These findings indicate that the aLHA plays an inhibitory role in the regulation of sexual arousal and an excitatory role in the regulation of ejaculation. Conversely, the NAc plays an excitatory role in the regulation in sexual arousal.

However, the tremor detected during SAM did not influence the accuracy of patients because of its relatively low amplitude. These results imply that the presence of tremor during movement is not restricted to advanced PD, but can also be detected in patients with early PD having relatively low amplitude tremor. Evidence that the tremor detected at rest, during posture and during voluntary movement share similar or overlapping neural substrates is also presented.

J	Camborde, ML; Thompson, CJ; Togane, D; Zhang, N; Reader, A				Camborde, ML; Thompson, CJ; Togane, D; Zhang, N; Reader, A			A positron-decay triggered transmission source for positron emission tomography	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NUCLEAR SCIENCE			English	Article						attenuation correction; plastic scintillator; positron decay; positron emission tomography (PET)	PET; CS-137	Attenuation of gamma rays is the most important correction required to provide artefact-free quantitative images in positron emission tomography (PET). We have tested a new technique, which allows multiple sources to be used for transmission scans. Each point source is surrounded by plastic scintillator, and the energy the positron must lose before annihilation is collected in the plastic scintillator coupled to a miniature photo-multiplier tube (PMT). The fast trigger from the PMT signals that positron decay has occurred, and arms a circuit to anticipate the arrival of one of the annihilation gamma rays in one of the scanner's conventional detectors. When this occurs, a line of response joining the current source position and detector position is identified. This technique has been tested using four Ge-68 sources imbedded in 5 mm diameter plastic cylinders coupled to miniature PMTs on the "ANIPET" small animal PET scanner at the Montreal Neurological Institute. Cross-talk (one plastic scintillator recording a gamma ray from any adjacent source instead of a positron from its own source) was 0.5%, and the count rate in one channel was 198 kcps implying a positron detection efficiency of 44%. Finally, preliminary images were obtained of the feasibility of using positron-decay as a transmission source.

J	Petit, Y; Aubin, CE; Labelle, H				Petit, Y; Aubin, CE; Labelle, H			Spinal shape changes resulting from scoliotic spine surgical instrumentation expressed as intervertebral rotations and centers of rotation	JOURNAL OF BIOMECHANICS			English	Article						spine; joint kinematics; center of rotation; intervertebral rotation; scoliosis surgery	ADOLESCENT IDIOPATHIC SCOLIOSIS; COTREL-DUBOUSSET; KINEMATIC ANALYSIS; VERTEBRAL MOTION; STATIC LOAD; RECONSTRUCTION; SIMULATION; AXIS	This paper reports the changes in spinal shape resulting from scoliotic spine surgical instrumentation expressed as intervertebral rotations and centers of rotation. The objective is to test the hypothesis that the type of spinal instrumentation system (Cotrel-Dubousset versus Colorado) does not influence these motion parameters. Intervertebral rotations and centers of rotation of the scoliotic spines were computed from the pre- and post-operative radiographs of 82 patients undergoing spinal correction. The three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of six anatomical landmarks was achieved for each of the thoracic and lumbar vertebrae. A least-squares approach based on singular value decomposition was used to calculate the rigid body transformation parameters. Average centers of rotation for all intervertebral levels are located in the neural canal at the mid-sagittal plane and approximately at the superior endplate level of the inferior vertebra. Intervertebral rotations have components in all planes: 6.7degrees (frontal), 5.5degrees (sagittal) and 4.5degrees (transverse) RMS for all intervertebral levels. Nearly all intervertebral rotations and centers of rotation are not significantly different for the two instrumentation systems. Various intervertebral rotations and 3D reconstruction errors were simulated on a theoretical model of a lumbar functional unit to assess the proposed method. Intervertebral rotation errors were 1.7degrees when simulating 3D errors of 3 mm on the position of the landmarks. Maximum errors for the position of centers of rotation were below 1 cm in the case of intervertebral rotations larger than 2.5degrees (most cases), but were larger (38 mm) for small intervertebral rotations (< 1 degrees). The type of instrumentation system did not influence intervertebral rotations and centers of rotation. These results provide valuable data for the development and validation of simulation models for surgical instrumentation of idiopathic scoliosis. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The P300 response was recorded from 28 electrodes during a modified visual oddball paradigm. Participants were instructed to press a key upon the appearance of the frequent stimuli as well as when a rare nontarget stimulus followed the frequent one. The other key was to be pressed when the subsequent rare stimuli (rare target) appeared until a frequent one reappeared. The symptomatic athletes displayed longer reaction times than the other two groups of athletes. The P300 amplitude to the rare target stimuli was significantly more attenuated in the symptomatic athletes than in the other two groups. Moreover, the P300 amplitude varied inversely with the severity of postconcussion symptoms but was not influenced by time elapsed since injury. Although the clinical significance of the P300 differences shown by the symptomatic athletes is still uncertain, the results do indicate that symptom severity may be a crucial indicator of functional impairments following mild traumatic brain injury.

Method: Twelve patients with OCD (per ICD-10 and DSM-IV criteria), aged 18 to 65 years, were assessed using MEG. Patients' classification according to the Yale Brown OCD Scale was as follows: severe = 8, moderate = 3, and mild = 1. MEG findings were compared with those of 12 age- and sex-matched healthy subjects (control group) with no previous history of psychiatric or neurologic disorders. All study participants underwent neurologic and basic medical examinations, including magnetic resonance imaging, electrocardiograms (EEGs), and electrooculograms. The study was conducted between January 2001 and January 2002. Results: Two types of MEG activity were observed in patients with OCD: (1) frontotemporal paroxysmal rhythmic activity with low-amplitude spikes (< 1 picoTesla) in 92% (11/12) of patients and (2) intermittent isolated spikes and sharp waves in all patients (12/12). The OCD group had paroxysmal rhythmic MEG activity in the cingulate cortex (12/12), insula (10/12), hippocampus (9/12), temporal superior gyrus and angular and supramarginal gyri (9/12), precentral and postcentral gyri (8/12), orbitofrontal cortex (5/12), and parietal lobes (5/12). MEG recordings were normal in the control group, and EEG findings were normal in both the OCD and control groups. Conclusions: Frontotemporal paroxysmal rhythmic activity with a preferential limbic distribution is a sensitive MEG finding in patients with OCD. Although the pathophysiology of this abnormality remains unknown, a corticostriatal network dysfunction was hypothesized.

Although this technique is becoming widely used, its reliability has yet to be established. Objective: To determine the reliability of MEPs and evaluate their stability. Design: Subjects received magnetic stimulation at 3 different sites: cranial, cervical, and peripheral. Three stimulations were given at each site. Stimulations were given under 4 conditions: eyes open or closed and with or without controlled mental activity. Setting: The study was performed in a research laboratory setting. Participants: Nine healthy subjects (mean age = 21 years +/- 0.9), asymptomatic of any neural or musculoskeletal dysfunctions. Main Outcome Measures: Normalized peak-to-peak amplitude of MEPs at the opponens pollicis muscle. Results: Intraclass correlations were high for all conditions (R > 0.90). The amplitude of the MEPs elicited from the transcranial site during the controlled mental activity condition was increased by 26.6% (P = .017). No other significant differences (P > .05) were obtained among the other conditions. Conclusion: Intraclass correlation results reveal that MEP measurements are highly reliable in a controlled environment. The increase of MEPs during the controlled mental activity condition could be attributed to an elevation of neural activity of different nonmotor areas of the brain increasing corticospinal excitability.

Although adverse effects are infrequent, some behavioural disturbances have been reported. Objective: To investigate the consequences of STN stimulation on emotional information processing in Parkinson's disease by assessing the performance of an emotional facial expression (EFE) decoding task in a group of patients before and after surgery. Methods: 12 non-demented patients with Parkinson's disease were studied. They were assessed one month before surgery and three months after. Their ability to decode EFEs was assessed using a standardised quantitative task. Overall cognitive function, executive function, visuospatial perception, depression, and anxiety were also measured. Twelve healthy controls were matched for age, sex, and duration of education. Results: Before surgery, the patients showed no impairment in EFE decoding compared with the controls. Their overall cognitive status was preserved but they had a moderate dysexecutive syndrome. Three months after surgery, they had significant impairment of EFE decoding. This was not related to their overall cognitive status or to depression/anxiety scores. Visuospatial perception was not impaired. There was no change in the extent of the dysexecutive syndrome except for a reduction in phonemic word fluency. Conclusions: Bilateral STN stimulation disturbs negative emotional information processing in Parkinson's disease. The impairment appears specific and unrelated to certain secondary variables. This behavioural complication of STN may have implications for the patient's social life.

Although most of the time unconscious, the programming of each saccade implies a complex decision which depends upon both the perceptual context and the intentions of the subject. The cerebral cortex is critically involved in deciding where, when and in which sequence we move the eyes. Using sophisticated experimental designs, such as the learning of sequences of saccades, has revealed that besides a core fronto-parietal circuit, prefrontal, cingulate, and mediotemporal regions seem critically involved in higher level oculomotor control. Understanding precisely the cortical networks associated to different components of ocular movements can certainly be very useful to characterize, test, and eventually detect various kinds of neurological pathology.

Regions were identified on high-resolution anatomical scans using a combination of manual and automatic methods. Only voxels identified as pure tissue at the resolution of the quantitative scans were considered for analysis. While no left/right differences were observed, significant differences were found among white-matter regions and gray-matter regions. These regional differences were compared with existing cytoarchitectural data. In addition, the pattern and magnitude of the regional differences observed in white matter was found to be different from that reported previously for an alternative putative MRI measure of myelination, the 10-50-ms T-2 component described as myelin water.

To understand the genetic basis of this syndrome in Portuguese Island populations, we performed a genome-wide scan of 29 families with schizophrenia, which identified a single region on 5q31 - 5q35 with strong linkage (NPL = 3.09, P = 0.0012 at D5S820). Empirical simulations set a genome-wide threshold of NPL = 3.10 for significant linkage. Additional support for this locus in schizophrenia comes from higher-density mapping and mapping of 11 additional families. The combined set of 40 families had a peak NPL = 3.28 ( P = 0.00066) at markers D5S2112 D5S820. These data and previous linkage findings from other investigators provide strong and consistent evidence for this genomic region as a susceptibility locus for schizophrenia. Exploratory analyses of a novel phenotype, psychosis, in families with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder detected evidence for linkage to the same markers as found in schizophrenia ( peak NPL = 3.03, P = 0.0012 at D5S820), suggesting that this locus may be responsible for the psychotic symptoms observed in both diseases.

We examined the electrophysiological properties of rat lumbar motoneurons following spinal cord transection, and the effects of two interventions shown previously to significantly attenuate the associated hindlimb muscle atrophy. Adult rats receiving a complete thoracic spinal cord transection (T-10) were divided into three groups receiving: (1) no further treatment; (2) passive cycling exercise for 5 days/week; or (3) acute transplantation of fetal spinal cord tissue. Intracellular recording of motoneurons was carried out 4-5 weeks following transection. Transection led to a significant change in the rhythmic firing patterns of motoneurons in response to injected currents, as well as a decrease in the resting membrane potential and spike trigger level. Transplants of fetal tissue and cycling exercise each attenuated these changes, the latter having a stronger effect on maintenance of motoneuron properties, coinciding with the reported maintenance of structural and biochemical features of hindlimb muscles. The mechanisms by which these distinct treatments affect motoneuron properties remain to be uncovered, but these changes in motoneuron excitability are consistent with influences on ion conductances at or near the initial segment. The results may support a therapeutic role for passive limb manipulation and transplant of stem cells in slowing the deleterious responses of motoneurons to spinal cord injury, such that they remain more viable for subsequent alternative strategies.

Ten monolingual English-speaking subjects were scanned while performing an identification task both before and after five sessions of training with a Hindi dental-retroflex nonnative contrast. Behaviorally, training resulted in an improvement in the ability to identify the nonnative contrast. Imaging results suggest that the successful learning of a nonnative phonetic contrast results in the recruitment of the same areas that are involved during the processing of native contrasts, including the left superior temporal gyrus, insula-frontal operculum, and inferior frontal gyrus. Additionally, results of correlational analyses between behavioral improvement and the blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) signal obtained during the posttraining Hindi task suggest that the degree of success in learning is accompanied by more efficient neural processing in classical frontal speech regions, and by a reduction of deactivation relative to a noise baseline condition in left parietotemporal speech regions.

Validation studies in animals are encouraging, but direct evidence in human brain is lacking, In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that APTD would reduce stimulated dopamine (DA) release, as assessed by positron emission tomography (PET) and changes in [C-11]raclopride binding potential (BP), a measure of DA D2/D3 receptor availability. Eight healthy men received two PET scans, both following d-amphetamine, 03 mg/kg, p.o., an oral dose known to decrease [C-11]raclopride BP in ventral striatum. On the morning before each scan, subjects ingested, in counter-balanced order, an amino-acid mixture deficient in the catecholamine precursors, phenylalanine, and tyrosine, or a nutritionally balanced mixture. Brain parametric images were generated by calculating [C-11]raclopride BP at each voxel. BP values were extracted from the t-map (threshold: t = 4.2, equivalent to p < 0.05, Bonferroni corrected) and a priori identified regions of interest from each individual's coregistered magnetic resonance images, Both receptor parametric mapping and region of interest analyses indicated that [C-11]raclopride binding was significantly different on the two test days in the ventral striatum (peak t = 6.31; x = -25, y = -8, and z = 0.1). In the t-map defined cluster, [C-11]raclopride BP values were 11.8 +/- 11.9% higher during the APTD session (p < 0.05), The reduction in d-amphetamine-induced DA release exhibited a linear association with the reduction in plasma tyrosine levels (r = -0.82, p < 0.05). Together, the results provide the first direct evidence that APTD decreases stimulated DA release in human brain. APTD may be a suitable new tool for human neuropsychopharmacology research.

At any given time, motorneurons exhibit one of two alternating states so that, on one side of the animal, the heart beats in a rear-to-front fashion (peristaltic), while on the other side the heart beats synchronously. Every 20 heartbeats, approximately, the two sides switch modes. It is known that the heartbeat rhythm is generated through burst of oscillatory activity produced by a central pattern generator (CPG) network of neurons. However, to the best of our knowledge, how the CPG activity is translated into peristaltic and synchronous rhythms in the motoneurons is yet unknown. In this work, we use symmetric systems of differential equations, accompanied with computational simulations, to investigate possible mechanisms for generating the motoneuron activity that characterizes the heartbeat of leeches and in particular the switching scenario.

In this study we have explored the possibility that progesterone, metabolites may be involved. Plasma levels of the progesterone precursor pregnenolone, progesterone itself, and five ring A-reduced metabolites of progesterone were measured in 20 women with CFS and in 13 age-matched controls. To minimize the contribution of the ovary, women were either post-menopausal or in the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle (day 4-8), and progesterone levels were all well within the expected range (less than or equal to3.5 nmol/l). Mean values for progesterone and all of its metabolites were higher in CFS patients, the most marked being a 2.3-fold elevation in isopregnanolone (3beta,5alpha-tetrahydroprogesterone; p less than or equal to 0.001). Progesterone levels were correlated with those of its metabolites, but even after controlling for progesterone by ANCOVA, isopregnanolone levels were still elevated (p less than or equal to 0.001). These elevated levels of isopregnanolone could not be attributed to medications (antidepressants and anxiolytics). When the CFS patients were divided into two groups according to their Hamilton depression scale ratings, mean (+/-SD) isopregnanolone levels were higher (274 +/- 160 vs 197 +/- 119 pmol/l) in the less depressed group (ratings 2-14) than in the more depressed group (ratings 17-28), although this difference did not reach significance. Progesterone levels were negatively correlated with Hamilton depression rating scores (r = -0.56; p < 0.01). These results suggest that increases in ring A-reduced progesterone metabolites, particularly isopregnanolone, are associated with CFS, and that the pathophysiology of CFS is unlikely to be due to depression.

The study also investigated the effect of propofol on central muscarinic receptor availability during general anesthesia. Six volunteers were scanned three times, once for baseline while awake, once during unconsciousness, and once after recovery to conscious level. An irreversible two-tissue compartment model was used to estimate the [N-C-11-methyl]-benztropine specific binding rate constant k(3), a measure of muscarinic receptor availability. Two different estimation methods were used: 1) optimization with positivity constraints on all the parameters; 2) optimization with additional constraints determined from a one-tissue compartment fit to the cerebellum. In regions with low to middle muscarinic receptor density, the k(3) values from method (2) had lower standard errors than that for method (1) and gave a higher correlation with the density of muscarinic receptors measured in human tissue by in vitro studies (r(2) of 0.98 for Method 2 and r(2) of 0.72 for Method 1). But the k(3) values determined by Method 2 had higher errors for regions with high muscarinic receptor density compared to Method 1. For both methods the mean k(3) values during unconsciousness were generally lower than those during awake for most regions evaluated. Therefore, the method with additional constraints derived from the cerebellum (Method 2) was deemed superior for regions with low to middle muscarinic receptor density, while the method with positivity constraint is the better choice in the regions with high muscarinic receptor density. Our results also suggest the existence of propofol-related reductions in muscarinic receptor availability. (C) 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Disruption of these behaviors is thought to support drug addictions and psychoses. The plasticity of dopamine-mediated behaviors, for example, habituation and sensitization, are not well understood at the molecular level. We show that in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, a D1-like dopamine receptor gene (dop-1) modulates the plasticity of mechanosensory behaviors in which dopamine had not been implicated previously. A mutant of dop-1 displayed faster habituation to nonlocalized mechanical stimulation. This phenotype was rescued by the introduction of a wild-type copy of the gene. The dop-1 gene is expressed in mechanosensory neurons, particularly the ALM and PLM neurons. Selective expression of the dop-1 gene in mechanosensory neurons using the mec-7 promoter rescues the mechanosensory deficit in dop-1 mutant animals. The tyrosine hydroxylase-deficient C. elegans mutant (cat-2) also displays these specific behavioral deficits. These observations provide genetic evidence that dopamine signaling modulates behavioral plasticity in C. elegans.

Here we show that the oval nucleus of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST-OV) exhibits a robust circadian rhythm in expression of the Period2 (PER2) clock protein. PER2 expression is rhythmic in the BNST-OV in rats housed under a light/dark cycle or in constant darkness, in blind rats, and in mice, and is in perfect synchrony with the PER2 rhythm of the SCN. Constant light or bilateral SCN lesions abolish the rhythm of PER2 in the BNST-OV. Large abrupt shifts in the light schedule transiently uncouple the BNST-OV rhythm from that of the SCN. Re-entrainment of the PER2 rhythm is faster in the SCN than in the BNST-OV, and it is faster after a delay than an advance shift. Bilateral adrenalectomy blunts the PER2 rhythm in the BNST-OV. Thus, the BNST-OV contains circadian clock cells that normally oscillate in synchrony with the SCN, but these cells appear to require both input from the SCN and circulating glucocorticoids to maintain their circadian oscillation. Taken together with what is known about the functional organization of the connections of the BNST-OV with systems of the brain involved in stress and motivational processes, these findings place BNST-OV oscillators in a position to influence specific physiological and behavioral rhythms downstream from the SCN clock.

This study investigates the effect of peripheral interleukin-6 on nociceptive transmission in naive and neuropathic states. Using an in vitro rat skin-nerve preparation, 50 ng interleukin-6 inhibited responses of single nociceptive fibers to noxious heat. A 20-ng sample of interleukin-6 only inhibited heat responses in the presence of soluble interleukin-6 receptors. To examine in vivo effects of peripheral interleukin-6, extracellular recordings from dorsal horn neurons were made in anaesthetised naive, sham-operated and neuropathic (spinal nerve ligated) rats. Peripheral interleukin-6 (40-100 ng) markedly inhibited all naturally evoked neuronal responses in naive rats, yet only neuronal responses to heat in neuropathic rats. Behaviourally, intraplantar administration of interleukin-6 (0.01-1 mug) elicited ipsilateral thermal hypoalgesia in naive rats. Thus, interleukin-6 inhibits normal peripheral nociceptive transmission, yet such anti-nociceptive effects are attenuated following nerve injury in a modality-specific manner. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

In the skin of the rat lower lip (hairy skin), sympathetic and parasympathetic fibers normally innervate the same blood vessels in the lower dermis but do not occur in the upper dermis. However, we have shown that sympathetic fiber migration into the upper dermis occurs following mental nerve lesions (Ruocco et al. [2000] J. Comp. Neurol. 422:287-296). As sensory denervation has a dramatic effect on sympathetic fiber innervation patterns in the rat lower lip skin, we decided to investigate the possible changes in the other autonomic fiber type in the skin-the parasympathetic fiber. Sensory denervation of the rat lower lip was achieved by bilateral transection of the mental nerve, and animals were allowed to recover for 1-8 weeks. Lower lip tissue was processed for double-labeling light microscopic immunocytochemistry (ICC), using antibodies against substance P (SP), which labels a subpopulation of peptidergic sensory fibers, and against the vesicular acetycholine transporter (VAChT), as a marker for parasympathetic fibers. In sham-operated rats, SP-immunoreactive (IR) sensory fibers were found in the epidermis and upper and lower dermal regions, whereas VAChT-IR fibers were confined to the lower dermis. Mental nerve lesions induced the gradual disappearance of SP-IR fibers from all skin layers accompanied by the progressive migration of VAChT-IR fibers into the upper dermis. Cholinergic fiber migration was evident by the second week post surgery, and the ectopic innervation of the upper dermis by these fibers persisted even at the last time point studied (8 weeks) when SP-IR fibers have completely regrown. VAChT-IR fibers were observed in the upper dermis, well above the opening of the sebaceous glands into the hair follicles. These results show that considerable changes occur in the innervation patterns of parasympathetic fibers following mental nerve lesions.

II: studies during treadmill locomotion	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						antidromic discharge; dorsal roots afferent; cat; locomotion; presynaptic inhibition	PRESYNAPTIC INHIBITION; FICTIVE LOCOMOTION; PRIMARY AFFERENTS; SPINAL-CORD; EXCITATORY RESPONSES; MUSCLE AFFERENTS; NEONATAL-RAT; REFLEXES; POTENTIALS; VOLLEYS	In a previous companion paper [Brain Res. 846 (1999) 87-105] we have shown that the dorsal root activity of a decerebrate cat is composed of both orthodromic and antidromic discharges as determined by spike triggered averaging (STA). Furthermore we have shown that, during fictive locomotion in decerebrate and paralyzed cats, antidromic discharges peak in different parts of locomotion cycle but mainly in the flexion phase. In the present study, we have recorded unit potentials from dorsal rootlets during treadmill locomotion in order to understand better the role of movement-related feedback in the generation of antidromic potentials. The unitary activity of 92 antidromically discharging units was recorded in proximal stumps of cut dorsal roots, and that of 20 such units was recorded in uncut roots using two bipolar Ag/AgCl electrodes in both cases. The activity of 80% (74/92) units in cut filaments and of 70% (14/20) units in uncut ones was phasewise related to stepping movements. The peaks of activity of different units occurred during different phases of the step cycle both in cut and uncut filaments. In most cases, the peak of activity was superimposed upon a background of sustained discharge. After blocking the orthodromic flow in a filament (local anesthesia or distal section), the antidromic discharges continued to peak during the same phase but the rate of the discharges increased. We conclude that movement-related afferent feedback significantly modulates the antidromic discharges in dorsal roots during treadmill locomotion. We suggest that these antidromic discharges have a role in controlling afferent feedback during movement. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The physiological origins of these cognitive deficits are not well documented. Two mechanisms have been proposed: disruptions in corticostriatal circuits or a deficiency in frontal dopamine. We previously used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in young healthy subjects to separate patterns of PFC and striatum activity during distinct phases of performance of the Wisconsin Card Sorting Task, a set-shifting task that reveals deficits in patients with PD. Here, the same fMRI protocol was used in PD patients and matched controls. Decreased activation was observed in the PD group compared with the matched control group in the ventrolateral PFC when receiving negative feedback and the posterior PFC when matching after negative feedback. In controls, these prefrontal regions specifically coactivated with the striatum during those stages of task performance. In contrast, greater activation was found in the PD group compared with the matched control group in prefrontal regions, such as the posterior and the dorsolateral PFC when receiving positive or negative feedback, that were not coactivated with the striatum in controls. These results suggest that both nigrostriatal dopamine depletion and intracortical dopamine deficiency may play a role in cognitive deficits in PD, depending on the involvement of the striatum in the task at hand.

This procedure is based on a fuzzy scoring function for choosing a subset of prototypes, which represent the closest resemblance with an object to be assigned. It then applies the majority-voting rule to assign an object to a class. We also present a medical application of this procedure as an aid to assist the diagnosis of central nervous system tumours. The results are compared with those obtained by other classification methods, reported on the same data set, including decision tree, production rules, neural network, k nearest neighbor, multilayer perceptron and logistic regression. Our results are very encouraging and show that the multicriteria decision analysis approach can be successfully used to help medical diagnosis. Crown Copyright (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier B.V.

In rats, this octameric protein is localized on the Golgi apparatus and binds brain microtubules (MTs) and vimentin. Subcellular localization of human formiminotransferase-cyclodeaminase and its implication in the pathogenesis of autoimmune hepatitis are unknown. Localization of the human formiminotransferase-cyclodeaminase in human hepatocytes was done using indirect immunofluorescence and subcellular fractionations followed by in vitro binding techniques. The formiminotransferase-cyclodeaminase antigen at two distinct locations in hepatocytes, free in the cytosol and associated with the Golgi membranes are recognized by anti-liver cytosol type 1 autoantibodies. The human formiminotransferase-cyclodeaminase binds reversibly to the Golgi membranes and this complex formation is increased by anti-liver cytosol type 1 autoantibodies. Finally, human formiminotransferase-cyclodeaminase does not interact with liver-specific cytoskeleton proteins. Anti-liver cytosol type 1 autoantibodies are directed against the mature high molecular form of human formiminotransferase-cyclodeaminase. Therefore, the subcellular location of the protein may influence the production of autoantibodies and their role in the pathogenesis of type 2 autoinumme hepatitis. This antigen-driven response does not appear to be facilitated or enhanced by a possible interaction between human formiminotransferase-cyclodeaminase and hepatocyte cytoskeleton proteins.

Four different F-2-lsoP regioisomers (5-, 8-, 12-, and 15-series), each comprising eight racemic diastereomers, total 64 compounds. Information regarding the biological activity of IsoP's is largely limited to 15-F-2t- IsoP (8-iso-PGF(2alpha)). We recently demonstrated that 15-F-2t-IsoP and its metabolite, 2,3-dinor-5,6-dihydro-15-F(2)t-IsoP, evoked vasoconstriction and TXA(2) generation in retina and brain microvasculature. We have now examined and compared the biological activities of a series of recently synthesized new 5-, 12-, and 15-series F-2-IsoP isomers in pig retinal and brain microvasculature. We hereby show that other 15-series F-2-IsoP isomers, 15-epi-15-F(2)t-IsoP, ent-15-F(2)t-IsoP, and ent-15-epi-15-F(2)t-IsoP, are also potent vasoconstrictors. The 12-series isomers tested, 12-F-2t-IsoP and 12-epi-12-F-2t-IsoP, also caused marked vasoconstriction. Of the 5-series isomers tested, 5-F-2t-IsoP and 5-epi-5-F(2-)IsoP possessed no vasomotor properties, whereas ent-5-F-2t-IsoP caused modest vasoconstriction. The vasoconstriction of ent-5-F-2t-IsoP, 12-F-2t-IsoP, and 12-epi-12-F-2t-IsoP was abolished by removal of the endothelium, by TXA(2) synthase and receptor inhibitor (CGS12970, L670,596), and by receptor-mediated Ca2+ channel blockade (SKF96365); correspondingly, these isomers increased TXB2 formation by activating Ca2+ influx (detected with fura 2-AM) through non-voltage-dependent receptor-mediated Ca2+ entry (SK&F96365 sensitive) in endothelial cells. In conclusion, as seen with 15-F-2t-IsoP, ent-5-F-2t-IsoP, 12-F-2t-IsoP, and 12-epi-12-F-2t-IsoP constricted both retinal and brain microvessels by inducing endothelium-dependent TXA(2) synthesis. These new findings broaden the scope of our understanding regarding the potential involvement of F-2-IsoP's as mediators of oxidant injury. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

However, the normal PrP may play an important role in cellular function in the central nervous system, since PrP is highly expressed in neurons and motifs in the sequence of PrP are conserved in evolution. The finding that prion null mice do not have a significant overt phenotype suggests that the normal function of PrP is of minor importance. However, the absence of PrP in cells or in vivo contributes to an increased susceptibility to oxidative stress or apoptosis-inducing insults. An alternative explanation is that the PrP normal function is so important that it is redundant. Probing into the characteristics of PrP has revealed a number of features that could mediate important cellular functions. The neuroprotective actions so far identified with PrP are initiated through cell surface signaling, antioxidant activity, or anti-Bax function. Here, we review the characteristics of the PrP and the evidence that PrP protects against neurodegeneration and neuronal cell death. (C) 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

An element of the malignant brain tumors' aggressive behavior is the fact that GB are among the most densely vascularized tumors. To determine some of the molecular regulations occuring at the brain tumor endothelium level during tumoral progression would be an asset in understanding brain tumor biology. Caveolin-1 is an essential structural constituent of caveolae that has been implicated in mitogenic signaling, oncogenesis, and angiogenesis. In this work we investigated regulation of caveolin-1 expression in brain endothelial cells (ECs) under angiogenic conditions. In vitro, brain EC caveolin-1 is down-regulated by angiogenic factors treament and by hypoxia. Coculture of brain ECs with tumoral cells induced a similar down-regulation. In addition, activation of the p42/44 MAP kinase is demonstrated. By using an in vivo brain tumor model, we purified ECs from gliomas as well as from normal brain to investigate possible regulation of caveolin-1 expression in tumoral brain vasculature. We show that caveolin-1 expression is strikingly down-regulated in glioma ECs, whereas an increase of phosphorylated caveolin-1 is observed. Whole-brain radiation treatment, a classical way in which GB is currently being treated, resulted in increased caveolin-1 expression in tumor isolated ECs. The level of tumor cells spreading around newly formed blood vessels was also elevated. The regulation of caveolin-1 expression in tumoral ECs may reflect the tumoral vasculature state and correlates with angiogenesis kinetics. (C) 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to elucidate and characterize the neural architecture underlying lexico-semantic processes in criminal psychopathic individuals and in a group of matched control participants. Participants performed a lexical decision task in which blocks of linguistic stimuli alternated with a resting baseline condition. In each lexical decision block, the stimuli were either concrete words and pseudowords or abstract words and pseudowords. Consistent with our hypothesis, psychopathic individuals, relative to controls, showed poorer behavioral performance for processing abstract words. Analysis of the fMRI data for both groups indicated that processing of word stimuli, compared with the resting baseline condition, was associated with neural activation in bilateral fusiform gyrus, anterior cingulate, left middle temporal gyrus, right posterior superior temporal gyrus, and left and right inferior frontal gyrus. Analyses confirmed our prediction that psychopathic individuals would fail to show the appropriate neural differentiation between abstract and concrete stimuli in the right anterior temporal gyrus and surrounding cortex. The results are consistent with other studies of semantic processing in psychopathy and support the theory that psychopathy is associated with right hemisphere abnormalities for processing conceptually abstract material.

J	Lalonde, J; Lachance, PED; Chaudhuri, A				Lalonde, J; Lachance, PED; Chaudhuri, A			Monocular enucleation induces nuclear localization of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV in cortical interneurons of adult monkey area V1	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV; primary visual cortex; primate; neuroplasticity; neuroprotection; monocular deprivation; activity-dependent regulation	PRIMARY VISUAL-CORTEX; STRIATE CORTEX; MEDIATED TRANSCRIPTION; SYNAPTIC PLASTICITY; NEURAL ACTIVITY; CALCIUM; NEURONS; EXPRESSION; ACTIVATION; ANTIBODIES	Elevation of intracellular Ca2+ levels activates calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMK) IV, which in turn plays an important role in neuroprotection and neuroplasticity. The possibility that CaMKIV is similarly involved in neocortical tissue has not been examined previously, especially with regard to the plastic nature of ocular dominance features in the primary visual cortex (area V1). We addressed this question by way of monocular enucleation (ME) to disrupt sensory input and examine CaMKIV expression changes in monkey area V1. Immunohistochemical staining of area V1 in normal infants showed a nuclear presence of CaMKIV, which did not changed after ME. However, a striking set of layer- and time-dependent changes in nuclear CaMKIV expression was observed in adult area V1 after ME. A strong increase in nuclear CaMKIV levels was evident in cortical layers II/III and VI after 1 d of ME and in layer IVC after 5 d of ME. These specific laminar changes persisted after 30 d of ME and, most notably, showed a columnar profile in which CaMKIV expression was linked to open-eye columns. Real-time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR and Western blot analysis showed that total amounts of CaMKIV mRNA and protein remained unchanged after ME, suggesting that a nuclear translocation may occur from the cytoplasm. Finally, double-label immunohistochemical staining with a pyramidal cell marker (SMI-32) showed that CaMKIV was absent in this subtype, whereas coincidental expression with GABA, parvalbumin, and calretinin, but not calbindin, showed its clear presence in a subset of interneurons. We propose that CaMKIV activity within diverse groups of cortical interneurons may play an important role in adaptive plastic reorganization of adult neocortical tissue.

Methods: Clinical and polygraphic information on the severity of the condition was obtained on 236 well-defined narcolepsy-cataplexy-human leukocyte antigen DR2-positive patients from Montpellier (France) and on 147 similar patients from Montreal (Canada). Results: The results show a progressive decrease in the number of SOREMP with age and a progressive increase in the mean sleep latency on the MSLT as a function of age. This finding is also related to the severity of cataplexy as assessed from the clinical history with a progressive decrease in the frequency of cataplexy attacks with age. These results may reflect the progressive increase in sleep latency seen in normal aging and suggest that clinical improvement might be due to changes in the neural mechanisms responsible for SOREMP, which may weaken with age. Conclusions: The progressive decrease in the number of SOREMP and increase in the mean sleep latency on the MSLT as a function of age suggest that the current criteria used for diagnosis may be too stringent in older patients. The major influence of age on MSLT results should therefore be taken into account when diagnosing a narcoleptic patient.

Reciprocally, transmitters used by these systems, including acetylcholine (ACh) and noradrenaline (NA), exert an inhibitory action on the VLPO neurons. Because nicotine, an agonist of ACh, acts as a potent stimulant, we queried whether it might participate in the cholinergic inhibition of these sleep-promoting cells. Indeed, we found that ACh inhibits the VLPO neurons through a nicotinic, as well as a muscarinic, action. As evident in the presence of atropine, the non-muscarinic component was mimicked by epibatidine, a nonselective nicotinic ACh receptor ( nAChR) agonist and was blocked by dihydro-beta-erythroidine, a nonselective nAChR antagonist. It was not, however, blocked by methyllycaconitine, a selective antagonist of the alpha7 subtype, indicating that the action was mediated by non-alpha7 nAChRs. The nicotinic inhibition was attributed to a presynaptic facilitation of NA release because it persisted in the presence of tetrodotoxin and was blocked by yohimbine and RS 79948, which are both selective antagonists of alpha2 adrenergic receptors. Sleep-promoting VLPO neurons are thus dually inhibited by ACh through a muscarinic postsynaptic action and a nicotinic presynaptic action on noradrenergic terminals. Such dual complementary actions allow ACh and nicotine to enhance wakefulness by inhibiting sleep-promoting systems while facilitating other wake-promoting systems.

This study assesses the effect of the caveolin-1 scaffolding domain (CSD) on the activity of the regulatory enzyme PLA(2). Caveolin-1 is a 22-kDa cholesterol-binding membrane protein known to inhibit the activity of most of its interacting partners. Our results show that the calcium-dependent cytosolic form of PLA(2) (cPLA(2)) and caveolin-1 co-localized in mouse primary hippocampal neuron cultures and that they were co-immunoprecipitated from mouse hippocampal homogenates. A peptide corresponding to the scaffolding domain of caveolin-1 (Cav-(82-101)) dramatically inhibited cPLA(2) activity in purified hippocampal synaptoneurosomes. Activation of endogenous PLA(2) activity with KCl or melittin increased the binding of [H-3] AMPA to its receptor. This effect was almost completely abolished by the addition of the CSD peptide to these preparations. Moreover, we demonstrated that the inhibitory action of the CSD peptide on AMPA receptor binding properties is specific (because a scrambled version of this peptide failed to have any effect) and that it is mediated by an inhibition of PLA(2) enzymatic activity (because the CSD peptide failed to have an effect in membrane preparations lacking endogenous PLA(2) activity). These results raised the possibility that caveolin-1, via the inhibition of cPLA(2) enzymatic activity, may interfere with synaptic facilitation and long term potentiation formation in the hippocampus.

The performance of the fuzzy controller depends on the choice of membership function and the inference of fuzzy rules that does not require an accurate mathematical model of power converter. The objective of this paper is to design a fuzzy controller using a Sugeno method, then optimizing it using an adaptative Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) and thereafter compare the simulation results with a proportional integral controler (PI). The output of these controllers is used to calculate the peak supply current. Simulation results are presented using Matlab. It is demonstrated that the fuzzy logic controller improves the performance of the active filter.

Combining the information from multiple subjects allows us to look for congruence or divergence of such patterns in the fMRI data across individuals. Inter-subject commonalities and differences in the connectivity pattern are seldom investigated in effective connectivity studies. In this paper, we propose a state-space modeling framework to study the dynamic relationship between multiple brain regions and also account for the individual variability in effective connectivity analysis. Our approach decomposes the observed multiple time series into measurement error and the BOLD signals. The proposed model consists of the activation and connectivity equations. In the activation equation, we model the observed signals at each brain region as a function of the BOLD signal. One special feature of our model for capturing the complexities of the dynamic processes in the brain is that the region-specific time-varying coefficients in the activation equation are subsequently modelled, in the connectivity equation, as a function of the BOLD signals at other brain regions. Because our model has a state-space representation, the parameters are readily estimated by maximum likelihood method.

In an in-building environment, the multipath caused by reflection and diffraction, and the obstruction and/or the blockage of the shortest path between transmitter and receiver are the main sources of range measurement errors. Due to the harsh indoor environment, unreliable measurements of location metrics such as received signal strength (RSS), angle of arrival (AOA) and time or time difference of arrival TOA/TDOA result in the deterioration of the positioning performance. Hence, alternatives to the traditional parametric geolocation techniques have to be considered. In this paper, we present a method for mobile robot location using WLAN ' s received power (RSS) data applied to an artificial neural network (ANN). The proposed system learns off-line the location RSS ' signatures ' for line of sight (LOS) and non-line of sight (NLOS) situations. It then matches on-line the observation received from a mobile robot against the learned set of ' signatures ' to accurately locate its position. The location precision of the proposed system, applied in an in-building environment, has been found to be 0.5 meter for 90% of trained data and about 5 meters for 58 % of untrained data.

Rule-based Cascade-correlation (RBCC) then grows its architecture by a competitive process where these rule-based networks strive at capturing as much of the error as possible. A pruning technique for RBCC is also introduced, and the performance of the algorithm is assessed both on a simple artificial problem and on a real-world task of DNA splice-junction determination. Results of the real-world problem demonstrate the advantages of RBCC over other related algorithms in terms of processing time and accuracy.

Each channel is composed of a Chopper stabilized (CHS) low-power front-end to remove the 1/f noise, and a mixed-signal compression module using an analog wavelet transform (WT) processor that covers the entire neural signals bandwidth. The proposed front-end is based on a new rail-to-rail preamplifier topology and its circuit simulation under 0.18 mum CMOS process demonstrates a power dissipation less than 25muW per channel. The main application of this medical device is to record action potentials evoked by visual stimuli, but it can be useful for several other cortical recording purposes.

To increase sensitivity while maintaining spatial resolution, we designed and constructed a multi-pinhole collimator array to replace the parallel hole collimators of a Ceraspect (TM) human SPECT brain scanner. The Ceraspect scanner is comprised of an annular NaI(TI) crystal within which the eight pinhole collimators (1 mm diameter holes) rotate while projecting non-overlapping images of the object onto the stationary annular crystal. In this manner, only 1/8(th) of a collimator rotation is required to acquire a complete tomographic data set. The imaging field of view (FOV) is 2.56 cm, which is sufficient to encompass a mouse. Data is currently acquired in step-and-shoot mode, however the system is capable of list mode acquisition with the collimator continuously rotating. Images are reconstructed using a cone-beam OSEM method. The reconstructed spatial resolution of the system is 1.7 mm and the sensitivity at the centre of the FOV is 13.8 cps/microCi. A whole-body bone scan of a mouse injected with Tc-99m MDP clearly revealed skeletal structures such as the ribs and vertebral bodies. These preliminary results suggest that this approach is a good tradeoff between resolution and sensitivity and, with further refinement, may permit dynamic imaging in living animals.

One of the most striking evolvements is the technology, of which FBG (Fiber Bragg Grating) sensor systems are embedded in fiber reinforced composite materials, so that any ambience induced responses of the host structures can be monitored in real time, consequently proper actuations are initiated. Thus a neural system is realized. This work reports an entire optimization process of the FBG sensors embedded in Graphite/Epoxy composite material. Moreover, performance of the sensor system was observed and the applicability is discussed. Due to the mechanically orthotropic characteristics of the Graphite/Epoxy composite material, two FBG sensors were orthogonally embedded along the two principle axes in mid-plane of the specimen. When strain load was applied along one of the axes, longitudinal and shear responses of the structure were simultaneously monitored, hence its orthotropic properties were determined. Further, any randomly oriented strain applied to the specimen will be analytically quantified along the two sensors. Recurring to surface mounted resistance strain gage concept, the embedded FBG strain gage array was recalibrated and its sensing alterability is quantified. This work tends to provide a quantitative discussion on FBG sensors' residual erroneousness after an optimized embedment, the conclusion may give designers a reference to properly interpret FBG sensors' performances, in case they are used as an embedded strain gage.

Cholinergic neurons form an important contingent of this relay, yet represent only a portion of the cortically projecting and other basal forebrain neurons, which include GABAergic neurons. By recording, labeling and identifying neurons by their neurotransmitter first in vitro and then in vivo, we have determined that the cholinergic neurons have different physiological and pharmacological properties than other codistributed neurons. Cholinergic neurons discharge at higher rates during cortical activation than during cortical slow wave activity, and are excited by transmitters released from brainstem afferent neurons, including glutamate from reticular formation, noradrenaline (NA) from locus coeruleus, and orexin and histamine from posterior hypothalamus. In contrast, particular GABAergic neurons discharge at higher rates during cortical slow wave activity and are inhibited by NA. When NA is administered into the basal forebrain in naturally sleeping-waking rats, it elicits an increase in fast gamma EEG activity and diminution of slow delta EEG activity while promoting waking and eliminating slow wave sleep (SWS). Cholinergic neurons also have the capacity to discharge in rhythmic bursts when activated by particular agonists, notably neurotensin (NT). When NT is administered into the basal forebrain, it stimulates theta activity in addition to gamma while promoting waking and paradoxical sleep (PS). By increasing discharge and firing in rhythmic bursts in response to transmitters of the activating systems, cholinergic neurons can thus stimulate cortical activation with gamma and theta activity along with the states of waking and PS. Colocalized GABAergic basal forebrain neurons which are inhibited by transmitters of the arousal systems can oppose these actions and promote delta activity and SWS.

In H. aspersa, the intestinal nerve branches profusely within the ovotestis and terminates in the walls of the acini and in the sheath surrounding the early portion of the hermaphroditic duct. We found both sensory and motor functions for this innervation. Significantly, there is a tonic sensory discharge generated by the mechanical pressure of growing oocytes, and the level of tonic afferent activity is strongly correlated with the number of ripe oocytes; this is probably a permissive signal that gates ovulation. Tactile stimulation of the ovotestis causes a phasic sensory discharge and a pronounced cardio activation. Also, an efferent discharge is elicited in the ovotestis branch of the intestinal nerve. To study the motor consequences of efferent activity, the ovotestis branch was electrically stimulated. We found that such stimulation evokes peristaltic contractions of the initial portion of the hermaphroditic duct and increases beat frequencies of the cilia that line the interior of the duct. These effects could facilitate the transport of oocytes down the duct. Still other functions of afferent activity are implied by changes in the spontaneous activity of mesocerebral cells following nerve stimulation. Putative sensory neurons and putative motoneurons have been identified in the visceral and right parietal ganglia.

In this paper, GA was used to select a subset of the suitable features at each node in the binary decision tree. The feature subset with maximum fitness is chosen and the patterns are divided into two classes using a linear decision function. In this way, the classifier using the binary decision tree can be constructed automatically, and the final recognizer is implemented by a neural network trained by standard patterns at each node. Experimental results are given to demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed scheme.

The purpose of this study was to assess the utility of a current concussion management guideline in classifying and managing mild concussion. Hypothesis: High school athletes diagnosed with a grade 1 concussion will demonstrate measurable decline in neuropsychological functioning that persists during the 1st week of recovery. Study Design: Prospective study designed to evaluate neuropsychological functioning both prior to and following concussion. Methods: Forty-three high school athletes completed neuropsychological test performance and symptom ratings prior to the season and at two times during the 1 st week following mild concussion. Results: Thirty-six hours after injury, mildly concussed high school athletes demonstrated a decline in memory (P < 0.003) and a dramatic increase in self-reported symptoms (P < 0.00001) compared to baseline performance. Conclusions: Athletes with grade 1 concussion demonstrated memory deficits and symptoms that persisted beyond the context in which they were injured. These data suggest that current grade 1 return-to-play recommendations that allow for immediate return to play may be too liberal. Clinical Relevance: A reconsideration of current concussion grading systems appears to be warranted.

However, the diagnostic specificity and the relationship of these changes to drug treatment and cognitive functioning remain unclear. We performed a comparative prospective brain MRI study in patients with COS and pediatric patients with transient psychosis with behavior problems (psychosis not otherwise specified) provisionally considered multidimensionally impaired (MDI). We hypothesized that cortical GM loss would occur in patients with COS but not in adolescents with atypical psychoses. Methods: Anatomical brain MRI was performed at baseline and follow-up in 19 patients in the MDl group (mean [SD] age of 13.3 [3.1] years); in 23 patients with COS matched for age, sex, IQ score, and drug treatment (mean [SDI age of 13.9 [2.5] years); and 38 healthy control subjects matched for age and sex (mean [SD] age of 13.3 [3.1] years). The mean (SD) follow-up was 2.5 (0.8) years. Volumes of the cerebrum and total and regional GM were obtained by using automated analysis, and percent change in volume across time was calculated. One-way analyses. of variance with post hoc Tukey Honestly Significantly Different comparisons were performed to examine group differences in the percent change in GM across follow-up. Results: The COS group had significantly greater total, frontal, temporal, and parietal GM loss than did the MDI or healthy control groups; analysis of variance post hoc P values ranged from .03 to .001. The MDI and control groups did not differ significantly from each other. Conclusions: The cortical GM volume loss in COS appears diagnostically specific; it was not seen in children and adolescents with atypical psychosis. Because both patient groups had similar early developmental patterns, cognitive functioning, medications, and hospitalizations, this progressive loss appears to be intrinsic to COS. An ongoing neurodevelopmental process and/or brain response specific to the illness could account for these changes.

These effects are associated with altered expression of genes in brain regions, such as the amygdala, hippocampus, and hypothalamus, that regulate the expression of stress responses. Studies from evolutionary biology suggest that such "maternal effects" are common and often associated with variations in the quality of the maternal environment. Together these findings suggest an epigenetic process whereby the experience of the mother alters the nature of the parent-offspring interactions and thus the phenotype of the offspring.

Endocrinological studies in humans have demonstrated the effects of self-esteem on basal regulation and reactivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis. To investigate the effects of differences in self-esteem on age-related changes in cognitive performance and HPA regulation, we investigated 20 healthy elderly subjects (age range 60-84, mean age 69.8 y). We assessed salivary cortisol levels together with neuropsychological assessment, and psychological assessment for self-esteem and locus of control. Across the study sample, age was significantly associated with reductions in cognitive performance and changes in basal cortisol regulation. Self-esteem appeared independent of age. Defining two groups of subjects with high and low self-esteem, age-related changes in cognitive and endocrinological variables became more prominent in the low self-esteem group, whereas age no longer had a significant impact on the variables in the high self-esteem group. These data suggest an effect of self-esteem on cognitive decline with aging. It further suggests an effect on age-related endocrine changes in humans. These results are discussed with regard to potential mechanisms by which the reported association between self-esteem and aging could be mediated.

We previously demonstrated that normal aging and pharmacological ( oxidative) stressors promote the transformation of astroglial mitochondria to iron-laden, diaminobenzidine (DAB)-positive cytoplasmic inclusions in sub-cortical regions of the rat brain. In the current study, we demonstrate that ( 1) numbers of DAB-positive glial granules in the rat dorsal hippocampus, an area implicated in learning and memory, progressively increase between 3, 12 and 22 months of age; ( 2) dietary restriction (40%), a manipulation that attenuates many mammalian aging processes, has no effect on the age-related accumulation of these gliosomes in the rat hippocampus; and ( 3) the latter can be accelerated by dietary supplementation of iron and copper. Our data support the view that dietary exposure to iron and/or copper in adult life can impact the sequestration of redox-active metals in aging hippocampal astroglia.

Modeling was modular and easily extendable to the systems with greater number of vesicular pools, parallel input, or time-varying parameters. Given an input (short or long tetanic trains, patterned or random stimulation) and the storage model, the vesicular release, the replenishment of various vesicular pools, and the vesicular content of all pools could be simulated for the time-invariant and time-varying storage systems. From the input stimuli and either a noiseless or a noisy output, the parameters of such storage systems could also be estimated using the optimization technique that minimizes in the least square sense the error between the observed release and the predicted release. All parameters of the storage model could be evaluated with sufficiently long input-output data pairs. Not surprisingly, the parameters characterizing the processes near the release locus, such as the fractional release and the size of the immediately available pool and its coupling to the small store, as well as the state variables associated with the immediately available pool, such as its vesicular content and replenishment, could be determined with fewer stimuli. The possibility of estimating parameters with random inputs extends the applicability of the method to in vivo synapses with the physiological inputs. The parameter estimation was also possible under the time-variant, but slowly changing, conditions as well as for open systems that are part of larger vesicular storage systems but whose parameters can either not be reliably determined or are of no interest. The quality of parameter estimation was monitored continuously by comparing the observed and predicted output and/or estimated parameters with the true values. Finally, the method was tested experimentally using the rat phrenic-diaphragm neuromuscular junction.

Here, we provide additional evidence on-the protective role of these polymorphisms in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), the most common pediatric cancer. A case-control study was conducted in 270 ALL patients and 300 healthy controls of French-Canadian origin. The TT677/AA1298 and CC677/CC1298 individuals were associated with reduced risk of ALL (crude odds ratio [OR] = 0.4; 95% confidence interval [Cl], 0.2-0.9; and OR = 0.3; 95% Cl, 0.1-0.6; respectively). Further stratification in patients born before and after January 1996 (approximate time of Health Canada recommendation for folic acid supplement in pregnancy) revealed that the protective effect of MTHFR variants is accentuated and present only in children born before 1996. Similar results were obtained when a transmission disequillbrium test was performed on a subset of children (n = 95) in a family-based study. This finding suggests gene-environment interaction and its role in the susceptibility to childhood ALL, which is consistent with previous findings associating either folate deficiency or MTHFR polymorphisms with risk of leukemia.

J	Giraldeau, LA				Giraldeau, LA			Introduction: Ecology and the central nervous system	BRAIN BEHAVIOR AND EVOLUTION			English	Editorial Material						cognition; behavioral ecology; ethology; central nervous system	COGNITION; BEHAVIOR	Behavioral ecology, the study of the survival value or function of behavior, has developed for a time by confining cognition to convenient black boxes that were assumed to be rigged by natural selection to direct an animal to the right decision for a given set of circumstances. However, the interpretation of test results concerning functional hypotheses about behavior depends crucially on assumptions made about their ability to collect and process information: cognition. Clearly, progress in behavioral ecology requires that the cognitive black boxes be opened and studied. This need coincides with an explosive growth of interest in animal cognition that has promoted and enhanced the level of interaction between behavioral ecologists and animal cognition scientists. The result promises to be profitable to the extent that it will raise interest and research in a number of new areas such as the costs in terms of survival value of evolving increased cognitive capacity or even the possibility of exploring brain morphology using a functional approach.

We review one of these programs, a program that uses the reported frequency of behavioral innovation as an operational measure of cognition. In both birds and primates, innovation rate is positively correlated with the relative size of association areas in the brain, the hyperstriatum ventrale and neostriatum in birds and the isocortex and striatum in primates. Innovation rate is also positively correlated with the taxonomic distribution of tool use, as well as interspecific differences in learning. Some features of cognition have thus evolved in a remarkably similar way in primates and at least six phyletically-independent avian lineages. In birds, innovation rate is associated with the ability of species to deal with seasonal changes in the environment and to establish themselves in new regions, and it also appears to be related to the rate at which lineages diversify. Innovation rate provides a useful tool to quantify inter-taxon differences in cognition and to test classic hypotheses regarding the evolution of the brain. Copyright (C) 2004 S. Karger AG, Basel.

In the present study, it is shown that serotonin (5-HT), as well as the selective 5-HT1A receptor agonist R-DPAT, increase cell survival and S phase transition in mouse splenocytes stimulated by T or B cell mitogens. Further examination of the mechanisms underlying increased cell survival revealed that 5-HT and R-DPAT inhibited apoptotic cell death, assessed both by soluble DNA content, internucleosomal DNA cleavage, and hypodiploid DNA content. Additionally, 5-HT and R-DPAT treatment increased intranuclear levels of the p50 and p65 subunits of NF-kappaB. Potentiation by 5-HT and R-DPAT of mitogen-activated cell survival, S phase transition, and nuclear localization of NF-kappaB, as well as inhibition of apoptosis, were all reversed by the selective 5-HT1A receptor antagonist WAY-100635. These results indicate that 5-HT1A-mediated promotion of cell survival and proliferation of mitogen-activated T and B lymphocytes is associated with increased translocation of NF-kappaB in the nucleus.

The main focus is on intrinsic properties of individual MNs that can be controlled by neuromodulators. These include: (1) amplification of the synaptic input at the cell's dendritic level by voltage-gated, persistent inward currents (plateau potentials); and (2) transduction of the net synaptic excitation into a frequency code (the MN's stimulus current-spike frequency relation) at the cell's soma/initial segment. Two other aspects of the synaptic control of MNs, which may affect their input-output gain, are also discussed. They include the hypotheses that: (1) a non-uniform distribution of synaptic effects to low- and high-threshold motor units causes a change in recruitment gain; and (2) recurrent inhibition, via motor axon collaterals and Renshaw cells, functions as a variable gain regulator of MN discharge.

This chapter summarizes some of the determinants of such a dramatic recovery of motor function. Fundamental to this recovery is undoubtedly the genetically based spinal locomotor generator, which provides an essential rhythmicity to spinal motoneurons and hence the musculature. Other factors are also important, however. Sensory feedback is essential for the correct expression of spinal locomotion because spinal cats, devoid Of Cutaneous feedback from the hindfeet, are incapable of plantar foot placement. The neurochemical environment also adapts to spinalization, i.e., the loss of all modulation by descending monoaminergic pathways. Post-transection spinal rhythmicity then becomes more dependent on glutamatergic mechanisms. Finally, we argue that the mid-lumbar spinal segments evolve to play a crucial role in the elaboration of spinal locomotion as their inactivation abolishes spinal locomotion. In Summary, the above findings suggest that the recovery of spinal locomotion is determined by a number of factors, each of which must now be more fully understood in the ever-continuing effort to improve the rehabilitation of spinal-cord-injured subjects.

Such morphology suggests that this pathway and its target spinal interneurons comprise varying types of functional subunits, which have a wide variety of functional roles, as dictated by command signals from the higher motor centers. Cortico reticular fibers are one of the major output pathways from the motor cortex to the brainstem. They project widely and diffusely within the pontomedullary reticular formation. Such a diffuse projection pattern seems well suited to combining and integrating the function of the various types of reticulospinal neurons, which are widely scattered throughout the pontomedullary reticular formation. The corticoreticular-reticulospinal-spinal interneuronal connections appear to operate as a cohesive, yet flexible, control system for the elaboration of a wide variety of movements, including those that combine goal-directed locomotion with other motor actions.

Neurons in the motor cortex command the changes in muscle activity required to modify limb trajectory when stepping over obstacles. Simultaneously, neurons in the brainstem reticular formation ensure that these modifications are superimposed on an appropriate base of postural support. Recent experiments suggest that the same neurons in the same structures also provide similar information during reaching movements. It is suggested that, during both locomotion and reaching movements, the final expression of descending signals is influenced by the state and excitability of the spinal circuits upon which they impinge.

Besides its well-recognized function in cellular eletrophysiology, HERG channels have also been implicated in neuronal differentiation and cell cycle regulation. We have recently found that HERG regulated apoptosis. To elucidate the signaling pathways, we performed studies in HEK293 cells stably expressing HERG channels. ELISA was used to quantify DNA fragmentation, a biochemical hallmark of apoptosis. In HERG-transfected HEK cells, the degree of DNA fragmentation was found consistently higher (similar to4-times) than in non-transfected cells. Correspondingly, remarkable activation of caspase 3, caspase 9 and cleavage of PARP were seen in HERG-expressing cells, which were otherwise minimal in non-transfected cells. Exposure of cells to H2O2 (10 hrs) at concentrations up to 1 mM, which is known to induce apoptosis in a variety of cells, caused minimal DNA fragmentation in non-transfected cells. HERG expression facilitates DNA fragmentation induced by H2O2 at a concentration-dependent fashion, starting at 200 muM and reaching maximum at 1 mM. Selective HERG channel inhibitors, dofetilide or E-4031 (5 muM) prevented DNA fragmentation. Inhibition of p38 by SB-2083580 alleviated DNA-F and PD-98059, which inhibited activation of ERKs, nearly abolished DNA-F. Immunoblotting analysis demonstrated that p38, SAPKs and ERKs MAP kinases were all substantially activated (>10-fold higher) in HERG-expressing cells vs. non-transfected cells. Akt activity was similar to4-fold lower in HERG cells vs. non-transfected cells in the absence of H2O2 and was slightly increased (similar to2-fold) after H2O2 exposure. We conclude that HERG channels facilitate cellular DNA fragmentation in HEK cells via concomitant activation of MAP kinases and inactiviation of Akt. Copyright (C) 2004 S. Karger Ag, Base l.

They act primarily on meningeal blood vessels and on trigeminovascular afferents, but they may also exert central effects. We studied the regional effects of acute and chronic treatment with sumatriptan or zolmitriptan on the rate of serotonin (5-HT) synthesis in the rat brain, using the alpha-C-14-methyl-L-tryptophan quantitative autoradiographic method. Sumatriptan at low (300 mug/kg, s.c.) and high (1 mg/kg) doses, as well as zolmitriptan (100 mug/kg), acutely decreased (15-40%, P < 0.05-0.001) 5-HT synthetic rate in many brain regions, including the dorsal raphe nucleus. Chronically, sumatriptan (21 days, approximately 300 mug/kg per day via osmotic minipumps) induced significant increases in the 5-HT synthesis rate in many projection areas but had no effect in the dorsal raphe nucleus. The acute effects on 5-HT synthesis rate would be compatible with activation of 5-HT1 autoreceptors that inhibit serotonin release. In contrast, the increased 5-HT synthesis rate observed after chronic sumatriptan might possibly result from a down-regulation/desensitization of 5-HT1 receptors and/or unmasking of excitatory triptan-sensitive 5-HT receptors. Overall, the present findings indicate that not only zolmitriptan but also sumatriptan affect brain serotonergic neurotransmission.

The development of vessel segmentation algorithms for PD images is of general interest since this type of acquisition is widespread and is entirely noninvasive. Whereas vessels are signaled by black blood contrast in such images, extracting them is a challenge because other anatomical structures also yield similar contrasts at their boundaries. In this paper we present a novel multi-scale geometric flow for segmenting vasculature from PD images which can also be applied to the easier cases of computed tomography (CT) angiography data or Gadolinium enhanced MRI. The key idea is to first apply Frangi's vesselness measure [4] to find putative centerlines of tubular structures along with their estimated radii. This multi-scale measure is then distributed to create a vector field which is orthogonal to vessel boundaries so that the flux maximizing flow algorithm of [ 17] can be applied to recover them. We validate the approach qualitatively with PD, angiography and Gadolinium enhanced MRI volumes.

Images captured by an onboard color camera are processed at video rate in order to track the operator's head and hands. The camera pan, tilt and zoom are adjusted by a fuzzy-logic controller so as to track the operator's head and maintain it centered and properly sized within the image plane. Gestural commands are defined as two-hand motion patterns, whose features are provided, at video rate, to a trained neural network. A command is considered recognized once the classifier has produced a series of consistent interpretations. A motion-modifying command is then issued in a way that ensures motion coherence and smoothness. The guidance system can be trained online.

This regenerative failure can be attributed to both a lack of positive cues and to the presence of inhibitory cues that actively prevent regeneration. Substantial progress has been made in elucidating the molecular identity of negative cues present at the CNS injury site following injury.-In the past several years, multiple myelin-associated inhibitors including Nogo, Myelin-associated glycoprotein and Oligodendrocyte-myelin glycoprotein have been characterized. Furthermore a neuronal receptor complex and several intracellular substrates leading to outgrowth inhibition have been identified. Rapid progress has also been made in identifing the role of neurotrophins and other positive cues in promoting axonal regrowth. The most recent advances in our understanding of positive stimuli for axon regeneration come from transplantation studies at the CNS lesion site. A number of artificial substrates, tissues, and cells including fetal cells, neural stem cells, Schwann cells and olfactory-ensheathing cells have been tested in animal models of CNS injury. Based on our expanded knowledge of inhibitory influences and on the positive characteristics of various transplants, a number of interventions have been tested to promote recovery in models of CNS trauma. These advances represent the first steps in developing a viable therapy to promote axon regeneration following CNS trauma.

Indeed, many behaviors associated with reward and reinforcement, for example feeding behavior, are controlled by distinct components of the endogenous opioid system located in relevant brain regions. It has also been shown that regardless of their initial site of action many drugs of abuse, such as morphine, nicotine, cocaine, alcohol and amphetamines, induce an increase in the extracellular concentration of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens. This increased secretion of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens seems to be a common effect of many drugs of abuse, and it was proposed that may mediate their rewarding and reinforcing properties. Furthermore, activation of mu opioid receptors in the ventral tegmental area, or of mu and delta opioid receptors in the nucleus accumbens enhances the extracellular concentration of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens. Thus, stimulation of the activity of distinct components of the endogenous opioid system either by opioid or by other drugs of abuse, may mediate some of their reinforcing effects. In this review article, a brief description of the endogenous opioid system and its implication in the processes of reward and reinforcement of opioid and other drugs of abuse will be presented. Furthermore, the use of opioid antagonists in the treatment of drug addiction will be discussed. Special emphasis will be given to ethanol addiction, the drug mainly studied in my laboratory.

Using in vitro and in vivo models, we have previously identified a role for the N-methyl-D-aspartate ( NMDA) subclass of glutamate receptors in the proliferation of striatal progenitors. Here, we compare the roles of ionotropic glutamate receptors in the proliferation of either striatal or cortical progenitors. In culture, glutamate receptor activation promoted proliferation of both striatal and cortical neuroblasts. However, cortical and striatal neuroblasts responded to distinct ionotropic receptors. Cortical cultures were sensitive to AMPA/KA receptor blockade, whereas striatal neuroblast proliferation was altered by NMDA antagonists. In vivo, BrdU uptake in the proliferative ventricular zone was reduced in embryos following acute administration of ionotropic glutamate receptor antagonists. In keeping with in vitro observations, proliferation in cortical and striatal ventricular regions was reduced, respectively, by either AMPA/KA or NMDA receptor blockade. We also determined whether forebrain-derived progenitors expanded as neurospheres in the presence of growth factors show similar ionotropic glutamatergic responses. Cells in neither dorsal nor ventral telencephalon-derived neurospheres showed altered proliferation following exposure to either class of ionotropic glutamate receptor antagonist. Together, these findings suggest that glutamate influences the proliferation of forebrain neuronal progenitors, but not more primitive populations represented in multipotential progenitors expanded in vitro. The effects on neuroblast proliferation in different forebrain domains are heterogeneous and are mediated by distinct subclasses of ionotropic glutamate receptors. Copyright (C) 2004 S.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS - The presence and the severity of the sensory neuropathy was evaluated with a clinical scale. Postural mechanisms and motor strategies of the ankle and hip joints were quantified by testing subjects in quiet stance on a dual force platform under two visual conditions (eyes open and eyes closed). Root mean square (RMS) values of the center of pressure (COP) time-varying signals and normalized cross-correlation function were used to estimate the contribution and the interdependence of postural control mechanisms. RESULTS - DSN patients show larger RMS values of the COPnet displacement in both anteroposterior and mediolateral (ML) directions. Motor strategies at the ankle joints are altered in DSN patients compared with healthy elderly subjects particularly in the ML direction. CONCLUSIONS - This experiment is the first to highlight that even with vision, postural mechanisms at the ankle joints are impaired in DSN patients during quiet standing. Our results point out the importance of focusing on postural control instability in ML of DSN patients.

The project is interdisciplinary and uses methodologies from aesthetic and cultural inquiry, mathematics and computer science. The results of the research are obtained by using a combination of tools, such as neural networks, pattern recognition techniques including edge detection, and pattern generating techniques such as shape grammars. The first phase of this research focuses on the analysis of Congolese Kuba cloth and Moroccan Zillij mosaics because each has a complete and complex surface pattern with very different characteristics. Our work has three main facets: the description of the geometric content of ethno-mathematical artifacts; the classification of this content; and the generation of grammatical rules for the creation of new designs based on the studied artifacts.

Basal secretion of the endproduct of the HPA axis, cortisol, follows a circadian rhythm, with the highest levels early in the morning and the lowest levels at night. Moreover, when released in response to stress, cortisol induces a negative feedback in the central nervous system (CNS) to terminate activity of the HPA axis when the stressor is no longer present. This normalization of activity is believed necessary to protect the organism from the long-term detrimental effects of chronic activation of the HPA axis. Normal aging is accompanied by a number of changes in the regulation and activity of the HPA axis. Basal cortisol levels, especially at night around the time of the nadir, are increased, and feedback sensitivity to cortisol at different levels of the CNS is decreased. The hippocampus is discussed as one of the structures involved in the changes of HPA regulation with aging. Receptors for glucocorticoids are primarily located in the hippocampus, and recent evidence suggests that basal cortisol and ACTH levels might be inversely associated with hippocampal volume, and thus might be at the origin of the age-related changes. Moreover, it has been shown that the inhibitory effect of glucocorticoid feedback on subsequent activity of the HPA axis is diminished in elderly subjects. Recently, we investigated cortisol levels during human aging together with CNS structures and personality variables. It appears that aging is not predictive of HPA axis regulation and structural CNS changes per se, but that specific personality types are less affected by age-related changes of the CNS and HPA axis regulation.

In adult rodents, leptin has been shown to inhibit adrenal steroidogenesis and we have recently demonstrated that some of the mechanisms responsible for leptin-induced inhibition of adrenal glucocorticoid production, namely a reduction of StAR protein expression are already present in the neonatal adrenal gland. The effect of leptin on the neonatal adrenal gland integrates well with the previously demonstrated effect of this protein to inhibit stress responses, enhance glucocorticoid receptor expression in the CNS and sensitivity to glucocorticoid inhibitory feedback in neonates. The leptin receptor isoform and intracellular mechanisms involved in regulation of the adrenocortical activity at multiple levels might differ between target tissues (CNS vs periphery) and age (neonates vs adult). Neonatal leptin represents an important regulator of adrenocortical function during a critical period of brain development, which is exquisitely sensitive to circulating glucocortcoid concentrations. Since circulating leptin levels in neonates vary according to maternal diet, this protein can be viewed as a critical link between environmental and maternal factors and the developing physiology of the infant.

Usually this depends upon a central DNA-binding domain that permits the binding of androgen-AR complexes to regulatory DNA sequences near or in a target gene. The AR also has a C-terminal ligand-binding domain and an N-terminal transcription modulatory domain. These N- and C-terminal domains interact directly, and with co-regulatory, non-receptor proteins, to exert precise control over a gene's transcription rate. The precise roles of these proteins are active research areas. Severe X-linked AR gene (AR) mutations cause complete androgen insensitivity, mild ones impair virilization with or without infertility, and moderate ones yield a wide phenotypic spectrum sometimes among siblings. Different phenotype expressivity may reflect variability of AR-interactive proteins. Mutations occur throughout the AR but are concentrated in specific areas of the gene known as hot spots. A number of these mutations of somatic origin are associated with prostate cancer. N-terminal polyglutamine (polyGln) tract expansion reduces AR transactivation, and when there are more than 38 glutamine residues it causes spinobulbar muscular atrophy, a motor neuron disease, due to a gain of function. Variations in polyGIn tract length have been associated as risk factors with prostate, breast, uterine, endometrial and colorectal cancer, as well as male infertility.

Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), the blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) response to the overt reading of emotionally neutral sentences was measured before and after a happy or sad mood induction. There was no explicit demand to produce affect-congruent speech and a cover story was used to de-emphasize the significance of the speech task in light of our experimental aims. Each fMRI measurement was acquired 6 s after the onset of sentence presentation so that speech could be recorded while the scanner noise was minimal; speech parameters (e.g. pitch variation) were extracted from the sentences and regressed against fMRI data. In the sad group we found the predicted changes in affect and pitch variation. Further, the fMRI data confirmed our hypothesis in that the 'reading effect' (i.e. the BOLD response to reading minus the BOLD response to baseline stimuli) in the supracallosal anterior cingulate cortex covaried negatively with both pitch variation and affect. Our results suggest that the anterior cingulate cortex modulates paralinguistic features of speech during affective states, thus placing this neural structure at the interface between action and emotions.

Halofantrine efficacy has been poorly assessed in non-immune children. In order to assess halofantrine efficacy in non-immune children with acute uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria, we collected data of children with positive blood smears in an open prospective study. Children with neurological manifestations, vomiting and congenital long QT were excluded. All children were hospitalised and received halofantrine (24 mg/kg divided into three doses per day) on an empty stomach. Persistent fever after day 3 defined failure. Relapse was defined by a positive blood smear with or without systemic symptoms within a I month follow-up period. In total, 52 children were enrolled. No failure was observed, but relapses occurred in 14/52. On univariate analysis, the mean age of children with relapse was significantly lower (P<0.05). Moreover, diarrhoea was more frequently associated with relapses (P<0.04). Age and diarrhoea were significant independent factors contributing to relapses. Conclusion: This study shows that with a relapse rate of 27%, this regimen with a 1-day course of halofantrine is not to be recommended.

Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the clinical, electrophysiologic and laboratory data of 17 patients with new-onset seizures after OLT among 367 adult and pediatric patients who underwent OLT between 1999 and 2001. Results: A suspected etiology of seizures was identified in most patients, including 6 (35.2%) with neurotoxicity due to immunosuppressive therapy, 4 (23.5%) with cerebrovascular disease, 3 (17.6%) with severe metabolic derangement by sepsis or rejection, and 1 each (5.8%) with hyperglycemia and brain edema due to fulminant hepatic failure. Causative factors could not be identified in 2 patients (11.8%). Seizures recurred in 15 patients (88.2%), with 9 occurring on the same day as the original seizure. Attacks caused by neurotoxicity tended to have an earlier onset, within 1 week in 4 of 6 patients, than those caused by cerebrovascular disease and sepsis/rejection, but this was not statistically significant. A total of 21 EEGs were performed in 13 patients. Eleven patients had abnormal EEG findings, of whom 4 (30.7%) showed epileptiform discharges, but the outcome of patients with epileptiform activity did not differ statistically from that of patients without such discharges (p > 0.6). The incidence of poor outcome ( death or persistent vegetative state) in the group with seizures was almost 10 times higher than in the group without seizures (52.9 vs. 5.7%, p < 0.001). The prognosis of patients with seizures due to cerebrovascular disease and severe metabolic derangement by sepsis/rejection was poorer than that of patients with seizures caused by the neurotoxicity of immunosuppressive drugs (p < 0.02), suggesting that the underlying cause of seizures is important in determining prognosis. Of 8 patients who survived, 1 was lost to follow-up. The long-term outcome of seizures in surviving patients was excellent, with all survivors available for follow-up being seizure-free for a mean follow-up of 42.5 months ( range, 16-58 months). Conclusion: New-onset seizures after OLT may herald fatal outcome, especially in patients with cerebrovascular disease or sepsis. The prognosis of seizures in survivors is excellent, and long-term antiepileptic drugs are not required in most cases. Copyright (C) 2004 S. Karger AG, Basel.

To test this hypothesis in humans, we studied brain activation during the discrimination of a series of overlapping and non-overlapping arbitrary visual stimulus pairs. We report that transitive inference about overlapping pairs is associated with right anterior hippocampal activation, whereas recognition of non-overlapping stimulus pairs is associated with bilateral medial temporal lobe activation centered in the anterior parahippocampal gyrus. We conclude that immediate access to simple stimulus-stimulus relationships is mediated via the parahippocampal gyrus, whereas the flexible representation of memory requires the recruitment of the hippocampus.

The present study shows that the iPLA2 inhibitor bromoenol lactone, when introduced into hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells through a patch pipette, generated a dose-dependent increase in the amplitude of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionate (AMPA) receptor-mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs). The iPLA2 inhibitor by itself interfered with neither paired pulse facilitation nor N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-mediated EPSCs, suggesting that its influence on synaptic transmission is postsynaptic in origin and specific to the AMPA subtype of glutamate receptors. Comparable results were obtained with palmitoyl trifluoromethyl ketone, a second structurally distinct iPLA2 inhibitor. The ability of iPLA2 inhibitors to increase AMPA receptor-mediated currents was also reproduced by MK-866, an inhibitor recognized to interfere with the generation of 5-lipoxygenase by-products of AA. At the biochemical level, we found that AMPA, but not NMDA glutamate receptor subunits, were upregulated in rat brain sections pre-incubated with the iPLA2 inhibitors. Collectively, these results provide the first experimental evidence that constitutive iPLA2 and/or its metabolites play an important role in the postsynaptic modulation of neurotransmission in CA1 pyramidal cells of the hippocampus.

In particular, the simulation illustrates the interaction of the persistent sodium current (I-NaP) and the hyperpolarization activated inward current (I-h) in the generation of subthreshold membrane potential oscillations. The potential role of I-h in contributing to the medium hyperpolarization (mAHP) and rebound spiking was studied. The role of I-h and the slow calcium-activated potassium current I-K(AHP) in action potential clustering was also studied. Representations of I-h and I-NaP were developed with parameters based on voltage-clamp data from whole-cell patch and single channel recordings of stellate cells (Dickson et A, J Neurophysiol 83:2562-2579, 2000; Magistretti and Alonso, J Gen Physiol 114:491-509, 1999; Magistretti et al., J Physiol 521:629-636, 1999a; J Neurosci 19:7334-7341, 1999b). These currents interacted to generate robust subthreshold membrane potentials with amplitude and frequency corresponding to data observed in the whole cell patch recordings. The model was also able to account for effects of pharmacological manipulations, including blockade of I-h with ZD7288, partial blockade with cesium, and the influence of barium on oscillations. In a model with a wider range of currents, the transition from oscillations to single spiking, to spike clustering, and finally tonic firing could be replicated. In agreement with experiment, blockade of calcium channels in the model strongly reduced clustering. In the voltage interval during which no data are available, the model predicts that the slow component of I-h does not follow the fast component down to very short time constants. The model also predicts that the fast component of I-h is responsible for the involvement in the generation of subthreshold oscillations, and the slow component dominates in the generation of spike clusters.

In particular, ridgelets and curvelets bases are similar to the sparse components of naturally occurring image data derived empirically by computational neuroscience researchers. Ridgelets take the form of basis elements which exhibit very high directional sensitivity and are highly anisotropic. The ridgelet transform have been shown to provide a sparse representation for smooth objects with straight edges. Independently, for the purpose of scene description, the shape of the Fourier energy spectra has been used as an efficient way to provide a "holistic" description of the scene picture and its semantic category. Similarly, we focus on a simple binary semantic classification (artificial vs. natural) based on various ridgelet features. The learning stage is performed on a large image database using different state of the art Linear Discriminant techniques. Classification results are compared with those resulting from the Gabor representation. Additionally, ridgelet representation provides us with a way to accurately reconstruct the original signal. Using this synthesis step, we filter the ridgelet coefficients with the discriminant vector. The resulting image identifies the elements within the scene contributing, to the different perceptual dimensions.

This technique is based on two main intuitive ideas: (i) complicated facial expression categories such as "anger" and "sadness", may be divided into several subcategories with different sub feature spaces where the recognition task can be performed with higher accuracy, and (ii) the k-means algorithm may be used to cluster these subcategories. A new image database with five facial expressions (neutral, si-nile, anger, sadness, surprise) of 60 women was constructed using a computationally efficient projection-based technique. Experimental results using the new database and an existing one (60 men) reveal that the new technique outperforms the standard vector matching technique and two recently developed methods using fixed-size and constructive one-hidden-layer neural networks. The mean recognition rate can be as high as 95% for the two databases.

This representation is based on the empirical distribution of features Such as tangents. and tangent differences at regularly spaced points along the character signal. Recognition is carried Out by a Kohonen neural network trained using the representation. In addition to the traditional Euclidean distance. functions such as the Kullback Leibler divergence and the Hellinger distance are investigated to evaluate similarity of feature vectors because these functions provide measures of distance between distributions. We report oil extensive experiments using a database of on-line Arabic characters produced without constraints by a large number of writers. Comparative results show the representation relevance and the Superior performance of the scheme.

The GNDAM is fundamentally different from other traditional AMs. Instead of using the derivative sign of a given weight to adjust its learning rate, this AM is based on a trial and error heuristic where global learning rates are adjusted according to the error rates produced by two identical networks using different learning rates. This AM was developed to solve a particular task: the orientation detection of an image defined by texture (the texture task). This new task is also fundamentally different from other traditional ones since its data set is infinite, each pattern is a template used to generate stimuli that the network learns to classify. In the previous study, the GNDAM showed its strength over standard backpropagation for this particular task. The present study compares this new AM to other traditional AMs on the texture task and other benchmark tasks. The results showed that some AMs work well for some tasks while others work better for other tasks. However, all of them failed to achieve a good performance on all tasks.

Using the transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model in Wistar rats, we have shown previously that ischemic animals develop systemic hypoxia from 6 hours to at least 24 hours after reperfusion, leading to increases in plasma erythropoietin levels, followed by transient increases in red blood cell counts and hematocrit values from 2 to 7 days. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate whether post-stroke systemic hypoxia in MCAO rats is associated with increases in systemic expression of inflammatory cytokines in blood and spleen at the mRNA level, focusing on IL-1beta, IL-6 and TNF-alpha. Results show that expression of the inflammatory cytokines is upregulated in ischemic brain tissue from 6 to 24 hours after reperfusion. No difference was observed between sham and MCAO rats in the expression of the cytokines in the peripheral tissues during the first 24 hours, while a marked increase was observed after 2 days of reperfusion, followed by a decline towards baseline levels after 7 days. These results indicate that post-stroke sytemic hypoxia is associated with a transient systemic inflammatory response which may modulate erythropoiesis.

Substance P (SP), by operating via the neurokinin-1 receptor (NK-1R), was identified as an important mediator of the nerve-mast cell interaction. SP was also found to activate basophils. Basophils are circulating leukocytes, and thus, the existence of cross-talk between basophils and nerves cannot occur in blood. This suggests that SP derives from a non-neuronal source in blood. In this study, we showed that the basophilic cell line RBL-2H3 express both NK-1R and SP. These findings strongly suggest the existence of autocrine tachykinergic regulation of basophils function.

This system is based on neural mechanisms underlying an information selection process. It is inspired from the cognitive model adaptive resonance theory [Biol. Cybernet. 23 (1976) 121] that proposes a neural explanation of how our brain selects information from its environment. In our approach, resonance, the key idea of this model is used to model the notion of relevance in information retrieval and information filtering (IF). The comparison of resonance with the previous models of relevance shows that resonance captures the very core of most existing models. Moreover, the notion of resonance provides a new angle to look at relevance and opens new theoretical perspectives. The proposed mechanism based on resonance has been directly implemented and tested on the TREC-9 and TREC-11 IF data. The experimental results show that this approach can result in a high effectiveness in practice. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In classifying complex patterns with high similarity like these defect patterns, the selection of an optimal feature set and an appropriate recognizer is a pre-requisite to a high recognition rate. In this paper GA and K-means algorithm were used to select a subset of the suitable features at each node in the binary decision tree. The feature subset with maximum fitness is chosen and the patterns are divided into two classes using a linear decision function. This process is repeated at each node until all the patterns are classified into individual classes. In this way, the classifier using the binary decision tree can be constructed automatically, and the final recognizer is implemented by a neural network trained by standard patterns at each node. Experimental results are given to demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed scheme.

Exploring hypofractionated regimens to replace the standard 6-week radiotherapy schedule is an attractive strategy as an attempt to prevent accelerated tumor cell repopulation. There is equally interest in dose escalation to the gross tumor volume where the majority of failures occur. We report our preliminary results using hypofractionated intensity-modulated accelerated radiotherapy regimen in the treatment of patients with GBM. Methods and Materials: Between July 1998 and December 2001, 25 patients with histologically proven diagnosis of GBM, Karnofsky performance status greater than or equal to60, and a postoperative tumor volume less than or equal to110 cm(3) were treated with a hypofractionated accelerated course of radiotherapy. The gross tumor volume (GTV) was defined as the contrast-enhancing lesion on the postoperative MRI T1-weighted images with the latter fused with computed tomography images for treatment planning. The planning target volume was defined as GTV + 1.5-cm margin. Using forward-planning intensity modulation (step-and-shoot technique), 60 Gy in 20 daily fractions of 3 Gy each were given to the GTV, whereas the planning target volume received a minimum of 40 Gy in 20 fractions of 2 Gy each at its periphery. Treatments were delivered over a 4-week period using 5 daily fractions per week. Dose was prescribed at the isocenter (ICRU point). Three beam angles were used in all of the cases. Results: Treatments were well tolerated. Acute toxicity was limited to increased brain edema during radiotherapy in 2 patients who were on tapering doses of corticosteroids. This was corrected by increasing the steroid dose. At a median follow-up of 8.8 months, no late toxicity was observed. One patient experienced visual loss at 9 months after completion of treatment. MRI suggested nonspecific changes to the optic chiasm. On review of the treatment plan, the total dose to the optic chiasm was confirmed to be equal to or less than 40 Gy in 20 fractions. When Radiation Therapy Oncology Group recursive partitioning analysis was used, 10 patients were class III-IV, and 15 patients were class V-VI. To date, 21 patients have had clinical and/or radiologic evidence of disease progression, and 16 patients have died. The median survival was 9.5 months (range: 2.8-22.9 months), the 1-year survival rate was 40%, and the median progression-free survival was 5.2 months (range: 1.9-12.8 months). Conclusion: This hypofractionated accelerated irradiation schedule using forward planning (step-and-shoot) hypofractionated, intensity-modulated accelerated radiotherapy is feasible and seems to be a safe treatment for patients with GBM. A 2-week reduction in the treatment time may be of valuable benefit for this group of patients. However, despite this accelerated regimen, no survival advantage has been observed.

More recently, however, common mutations (or polymorphisms) in enzymes of folate metabolism have become identified as potential risk modifiers of several multifactorial disorders including neural tube defects, pregnancy complications, vascular disease, and cancer. The first and best characterized of this group of variants is an alanine-to-valine substitution at bp 677 of the enzyme methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) which synthesizes the folate derivative for homocysteine remethylation to methionine. This variant, present in the homozygous state in 10% - 15% of many North American, European, and Asian populations, results in mild hyperhomocysteinemia predominantly when folate status is low; this observation alludes to an increased requirement for folate in mutant individuals. The clinical impact of this variant, as well as a brief description of other variants in folate/homocysteine metabolism, will be discussed. In more recent work, we generated a mouse model with MTHFR deficiency, in order to address the genetic-nutrient interactive effect and the biologic consequences of a disruption of folate metabolism. These mice have hyperhomocysteinemia, altered methylation, and enhanced utilization of choline/betaine to increase methionine biosynthesis. In addition, the mice appear to be quite useful as animal models for some of the above-mentioned clinical disorders.

Since, losartan, an AT(1) receptor antagonist, has been shown to attenuate the L-NAME-incluced increase in blood pressure, we undertook the present studies to evaluate whether losartan-induced decreased blood pressure in this model of hypertension is associated with attenuation of enhanced expression of Gi proteins and adenylyl cyclase signalling. Methods L-NAME (70 mg/kg body weight) and losartan (10 mg/kg body weight), alone or in combination, were given orally to Sprague-Dawley rats for 4 weeks. The control rats received only plain tap water. The levels of inhibitory guanine nucleotide regulatory proteins (Gialpha-2 and Gialpha-3) and stimulatory (Gsalpha) proteins and Gialpha mRNA in hearts were determined by immunoblotting and Northern blotting, respectively. Adenylyl cyclase activity was determined by measuring [P-32]cAMP formation from [P-32]ATP. Results Systolic blood pressure was enhanced in L-NAMEtreated rats compared to control rats (164 +/- 5.2 versus 105 +/- 2 mmHg; n = 30), and was significantly attenuated by losartan treatment (164 +/- 5.2 mmHg versus 120 +/- 2.5 mmHg; n = 30). The expression of Gialpha-2 and Gialpha-3 proteins and their rnRNA, which was enhanced in LNAME-treated rats, was reversed by losartan treatment. However, losartan alone did not alter the levels of Gsalpha or Gialpha proteins. In addition, the stimulatory effects of guanosine 5'-y-thiotriphosphate (GTPgammaS), isoproterenol, 5'-N-ethylcarboxamideadenosine (NECA), glucagon, forskolin (FSK) and sodium fluoride (NaF) on adenylyl cyclase, which were diminished in L-NAME-treated rats, were reversed by losartan treatment. Furthermore, the inhibition of forskolin-stimulated enzyme activity by low concentrations of GTPgammaS (receptor-independent Gi functions), which was significantly enhanced in L-NAMEtreated rats, was attenuated by losartan treatment. In addition, losartan was able to reverse the attenuated receptor-mediated inhibitions of adenylyl cyclase by oxotremorine and angiotensin II towards control. Conclusions These results suggest the implication of AT, receptors in enhanced expression of Gialpha proteins and increased blood pressure in L-NAME-induced hypertension.

However, most previous reports of genotype-phenotype correlation have involved unrelated individuals, who, even if they share the same mutations, are not as genetically close as siblings. We have studied 24 groups (mostly pairs) of Canadian siblings with type I (non-neuronopathic) Gaucher disease. Since most Canadian provinces have adopted similar criteria for instituting enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), the age at which ERT is begun can serve as a rough surrogate for disease severity, and concordance (or lack of concordance) can be examined between siblings. In 14 of the 24 sibling families, there was sibling concordance: either both siblings were not on ERT, or both were on ERT and had begun at roughly the same age. In these families, there was also much similarity in the clinical features of the disease between siblings. In the other 10 families there was lack of sibling concordance, with only one sibling receiving ERT (or, in one family with three affected siblings, two of three on ERT). In these families, there was also much discrepancy between siblings in the clinical features (as might be expected in a setting where the guidelines for starting ERT are relatively uniform). Possible reasons for the discordances between siblings include macro-environmental and microenvironmental differences. The latter may include micro-environments at the level of the cell (e.g. lysosomal pH, alternative substrates) or at the level of the chromosome (contiguous genes, modifier genes, neutral polymorphisms in GBA).

However, the capability of Mindstreams tests to discriminate the elderly with MCI from those who are cognitively healthy has yet to be evaluated. Moreover, the comparability between these tests and traditional neuropsychological tests in detecting MCI has not been examined. A two-center study was designed to assess the discriminant validity of tests in the Mindstreams Mild Impairment Battery. Participants were 30 individuals diagnosed with MCI, 29 with mild Alzheimer's disease (AD), and 39 healthy elderly. Testing was with the Mindstreams battery and traditional neuropsychological tests. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to examine the ability of Mindstreams and traditional measures to discriminate those with MCI from cognitively healthy elderly. Between-group comparisons were made (Mann-Whitney U test) between MCI and healthy elderly and between MCI and mild AD groups. Mindstreams outcome parameters across multiple cognitive domains significantly discriminated between MCI and healthy elders with considerable effect sizes (p < 0.05). Measures of memory, executive function, visual spatial skills, and verbal fluency discriminated best, and discriminability was at least comparable to that of traditional neuropsychological tests in these domains. Mindstreams tests are effective in detecting MCI, providing a comprehensive profile of cognitive function. Further, the enhanced precision and ease of use of these computerized tests make the NeuroTrax system a valuable clinical tool in the identification of elders at high risk for dementia.

Recently, we found that exposure to an entraining light pulse caused a suppression of Fos expression in the SCN shell in rats. To study the hypothesis that suppression of Fos in the shell is a correlate of photic entrainment, we used rats that were treated with the retinal neurotoxin monosodium glutamate (MSG) during the neonatal period. In spite of retinal degeneration, MSG-treated rats entrained normally and displayed light-induced suppression of Fos within the SCN shell. These results support the view that light-induced suppression of Fos within the SCN shell is a cellular correlate of photic entrainment.

The study also examines the association between severity of disease and comorbidity and the use of specific defense mechanisms. Sixty panic-disordered patients and 31 controls participated in the study. The Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview was used to confirm the panic disorder diagnosis and to establish the comorbid diagnosis. The Clinical Global Impression (CGI) was used to assess severity and the Defensive Style Questionnaire (DSQ-40) was used to evaluate the defense mechanisms. Panic patients used more neurotic (mean = 4.9 versus 3.6; p < 0.001) and immature (mean = 3.9 versus 2.8; p < 0.001) defenses as compared with controls. Panic patients with severe disease (n = 37; CGI>4) had more depression comorbidity and used more immature defenses than patients with CGI 4 (n = 23; mean = 4.2 versus 3.5; p < 0.001). It was concluded that the panic severity and depression comorbidity found in Brazilian panic-disordered patients are associated with the use of maladaptive mechanisms, namely immature defenses.

While the differential expression of IF genes during embryonic development suggests potential functions of these proteins in axogenesis, none of the IF gene knockout experiments in mice caused gross developmental defects of the nervous system. Yet, deficiencies in neuronal IF proteins are not completely innocuous. Substantial developmental loss of motor axons was detected in mice lacking NF-L and in double knockout NF-M;NF-H mice, supporting the view of a role for IFs in axon stabilization. Moreover, the absence of peripherin resulted in approximate to30% loss of small sensory axons. Mice lacking NF-L had a scarcity of IF structures and exhibited a severe axonal hypotrophy, causing up to 50% reduction in conduction velocity, a feature that would be very detrimental for large animal species. Unexpectedly, the NF-M rather than NF-H protein turned out to be required for proper radial growth of large myelinated axons. Studies with transgenic mice suggest that some types of IF accumulations, reminiscent of those found in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), can have deleterious effects and even cause neurodegeneration. Additional evidence for the involvement of IFs in pathogenesis came from the recent discovery of neurofilament gene mutations linked to ALS and Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT2E). Conversely, we discuss how certain types of perikaryal neurofilament aggregates might confer protection in motor neuron disease. (C) 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

However, taurine, an agonist of GlyRs, is abundant throughout the brain, especially during early development. In the present study on freshly dissociated NAcc neurons from young Sprague-Dawley rats (12- to 21-day old), we found that both glycine and taurine can strongly depolarize NAcc neurons and modulate their excitability. In voltage-clamped NAcc neurons, glycine and taurine elicited chloride currents (I-Gly and I-Tau) with an EC50 of 0.12 and 1.25 mM, respectively. The reversal potential of IGly or I-Tau was 0 mV in conventional whole cell mode and -30 mV in gramicidin-perforated mode. At concentrations <1 mM, both glycine and taurine were very effectively antagonized by strychnine and by picrotoxin (with an IC50 of 60 nM and 36.5 &mu;M for I-Gly, and 40 nM and 42.2 &mu;M for I-Tau) but were insensitive to 10 &mu;M bicuculline. The currents elicited by taurine (&LE;1 mM) showed complete cross-desensitization with I-Gly, but none with &gamma;-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-induced currents (I-GABA). However, I Tau elicited by very concentrated taurine (10 mM) showed partial cross-desensitization with I-GABA, and it was substantially antagonized by 10 &mu;M bicuculline. These results indicate that taurine binds mainly to GlyRs in NAcc, but it could be a partial agonist of GABA(A) receptors. By activating GlyRs, taurine may play an important physiological role in the control of NAcc function, especially during development.

In mice and rats, VK deficiency decreases levels of brain sulfatides and causes behavioral alterations. In light of its heterogeneity and to better understand the role of VK in the brain, we characterized the distribution of the two main VK vitamers, phylloquinone (K-1) and menaquinone-4 (MK-4), in nine distinct brain regions. Weaning female Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 5/dietary group) were fed diets containing either low (L, 80 mug/kg diet), adequate (A, 500 mug/kg diet) or high (H, 2000 mug/kg diet) levels of K-1 for 6 mo. The main form of VK in the brain was MK-4, and it was present in significantly higher concentrations in myelinated regions (the pons medulla and midbrain) than in nonmyelinated regions. Both regional K-1 and MK-4 increased with K-1 intake (P < 0.05). Sphingolipid distribution varied across brain regions (P < 0.001) but was not affected by K-1 intake. In the L and A groups but not the H group, brain MK-4 concentration was positively correlated with the concentrations of sulfatides (L, r = 0.518; A, r = 0.479) and sphingomyelin (L, r = 0.515; A, r = 0.426), and negatively correlated with ganglioside concentration (L, r = -0.398); A, r = -0.353). Sphingolipids are involved in major cellular events such as cell proliferation, differentiation and survival. The strong associations reported here between brain MK-4 and sphingomyelin, sulfatides and gangliosides suggest that this vitamer may play an important role in the brain.

In addition, 5-HT anomalies in individuals with eating disorders are believed to have multiple determinants associated with secondary (state-related) effects of their nutritional status, hereditary effects (related to such trait variations as impulsivity or perfectionism) and, possibly, long-term neurobiologic sequelae of developmental stressors (such as childhood abuse). On the strength of the available neurobiologic and genetic data, this paper presents the idea that 5-HT variations in those with eating disorders represent (1) a structured coaggregation of biologic, psychologic and social influences and (2) converging state, trait and developmental effects. Data are taken to support a multidimensional model of 5-HT function in eating disorders that, it is argued, can serve as a prototype for etiologic modelling, diagnostic classification and clinical decision-making bearing not only upon eating disorders but also upon other psychiatric disturbances.

In addition, abnormalities of the peripheral nervous system, such as peripheral nerve entrapments, often affect hand intrinsic muscle strength of SCI patients. Therefore, measuring hand intrinsic strength may allow for early diagnosis of neurologic decline. Methods: A method was developed for measuring strength of hand intrinsic muscles with a handheld myometer. With the use of a handheld myometer, this study examined the distribution of strength measurements for second-digit abductors, fifth-digit abductors, and thumb opposers in able-bodied participants and in individuals with weakness. The quantitative measurements were compared with manual muscle test scores and interrater reliability is described for these hand intrinsic strength measurements. Thirty-one able-bodied individuals participated (17 men, 14 women; mean age = 37.7 years). In addition, 24, patients with SCI participated (23 men, 1 woman; mean age = 53.5 years; 9 with paraplegia and 14 with tetraplegia as a primary diagnosis). The Bland-Altman method was used to test for interrater reliability. Results: Mean strength of able-bodied participants was 5.0 kg for second-digit abduction, 3.1 kg for fifth-digit abduction, and 5.0 kg for thumb opposition, and the lower limits of normal were 3.0, 1.8, and 3.4 kg, respectively. The 95th percentile of interrater differences were 29.3% for second-digit abduction, 38.5% for fifth-digit abduction, and 43.7% for thumb opposition. Conclusion: Abnormal hand intrinsic strength should be suspected if values are lower than the 5th percentile values listed above or if strength change exceeds the 95th percentile for interrater differences shown above. These quantitative hand strength measurements may allow for earlier diagnosis of secondary neurologic complications and may aid in monitoring neurologic recovery in persons with SCI.

We hypothesize that FA+ will not activate key brain areas involved in emotional processing. Conversely, FA- will have a functional mirror system for emotional resonance confirmed by activation of the prefrontal cortex and behavioral results. To test this hypothesis, we compared the two groups using blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) displaying a passive visual task (44 negative IAPS pictures and 44 neutral pictures). A random-effects analysis, for schizophrenia patients FA-, revealed significant loci of activation in the left mesial prefrontal (MPFC), right orbitofrontal (OFC) and left anterior cingulate cortices (ACC). Correlational analyses carried out between self-report ratings of negative feelings and BOLD signal changes revealed the existence of positive correlation in the LACC, LMPFC and ROFC. Conversely, FA+ did not show significant activation in the prefrontal. cortex. We propose that negative emotional resonance induced by passively viewing negative pictures may be a form of "mirroring" that grounds negative feelings via an experiential mechanism. Hence, it could be argued that FA- were able to 'feel' emotions through this resonance behavior. Conversely, we suggest that the dysfunction seen in the FA+ group is a failure or distortion in the development of the MN system. This could be due to genetic or other endogenous causes, which affected prefrontal cortex MN involved in emotional resonance. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Roy, JP				Roy, JP			Socioeconomic status and health: a neurobiological perspective	MEDICAL HYPOTHESES			English	Article							SOCIAL COGNITION; MATERNAL-CARE; STRESS; AMYGDALA; CORTEX; BRAIN; RESPONSES; BEHAVIOR; NEURONS; REWARD	Socioeconomic status (SES) is one of the strongest predictors of health in industrial nations. This is especially true of societies with large disparities between rich and poor. Evidence suggests that the interactions between individuals of different SES play a crucial role in mediating the effects of SES on health. The question is why? Because humans are extremely social animals, their sense of well being is to a large extent determined by their social interactions. In hierarchical societies, individuals at every level of the hierarchy have to submit to those above and the recognition of this submissiveness generates emotions such as shame, anger and depression. These emotions lead to the activation of physiological alarm systems such as the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis and the sympathetic nervous system. The chronic activation of these systems alter their set points. This results in changes in the systems' different target organs responsible for diseases such as adult onset diabetes, hypertension, atherosclerosis, major depression and autoimmune diseases. Recent evidence from neurobiology show that one brain area, the amygdala, plays a pivotal rote in processing social emotions. Anatomical and physiological studies of the amygdala in animals show how this area could play the central role in activating the alarm systems. This recent evidence brings a deeper level of plausibility to the postulated mechanisms of activation of the alarm systems by social emotions. Other experimental evidence also shed more light on the pathways responsible for translating psychosocial experiences into physiological perturbations. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The development of vessel segmentation algorithms for PD images is of general interest since this type of acquisition is widespread and is entirely noninvasive. Whereas vessels are signaled by black blood contrast in such images, extracting them is a challenge because other anatomical structures also yield similar contrasts at their boundaries. In this paper, we present a novel multi-scale geometric flow for segmenting vasculature from standard MRI which can also be applied to the easier cases of angiography data. We first apply Frangi's vesselness measure [3] to find putative centerlines of tubular structures along with their estimated radii. This measure is then distributed to create a vector field which is orthogonal to vessel boundaries so that the flux maximizing geometric flow algorithm of [14] can be used to recover them. We perform a quantitative cross validation on PD, phase contrast (PC) angiography and time of flight (TOF) angiography volumes, all obtained for the same subject. A significant finding is that whereas more than 80% of the vasculature recovered from the angiographic data is also recovered from the PD volume, over 25% of the vasculature recovered from the PD volume is not detected in the TOF data. Thus, the technique can be used not only to improve upon the results obtained from angiographic data but also as an alternative when such data is not available.

An absolute gold standard for registration evaluation was obtained by considering realistic normal and ictal SPECT simulations deduced from a high resolution T1-weighted MRI data set. Those simulations were also used to study the impact of photon attenuation and Compton scatter corrections on registration accuracy. Evaluation of registration was also performed using inconsistency measurements for six patients with temporo-mesial epilepsy. For these data, as no Gold Standard was available, registration accuracy was assessed using inconsistency measurements involving a registration loop between inter-ictal SPECT, ictal SPECT and MRI data. Five registration methods based on statistical similarity measurements were compared, namely: mutual information (MI), normalized mutual information (NMI), L1 and L2 norm-based correlation ratios (CR) and correlation coefficient (CC). It was found that the simulation context had more influence on registration accuracy than the choice of the similarity criterion. Ictal SPECT as well as correction for uniform attenuation clearly decreased SPECT/MRI registration accuracy.

Alongside the well-documented clinical characteristics of the condition, recent advances in technology and methodology have begun to define FXS at a number of different levels: genetic, brain structure and function, cognition, and behavior. This article suggests that the FXS phenotype is not merely a juxtaposition of spared and impaired functions but rather may be characterized by an inhibitory control deficit that interferes with the individual's ability to modulate output causing perseverative responding across various skill areas. It is further suggested that an inability to modulate arousal may be at least one cause for the inhibitory control deficit that typifies the FXS phenotype. The approach to understanding atypical development outlined here holds exciting promise for future research in FXS and other developmental disorders. (C) 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

This region contains several transcribed genes including neurotensin (NTS), which, as an important modulator of the dopaminergic transmission, represents a strong functional and positional candidate in the context of RLS. In this study, NTS was evaluated for mutational analysis. A panel of 19 individuals from 4 families supporting linkage to 12q was investigated using a combined denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (dHPLC) and direct sequencing method. Analysis of the NTS genomic sequence revealed 2 intronic polymorphisms and 1 variant located in the 5' untranslated region (UTR). None of the observed variants co-segregated with RLS and no disease-associated polymorphisms were detected in any of the analyzed families. Based on these results, it is unlikely that NTS is the gene responsible for RLS in chromosome 12-linked families. (C) 2003 Movement Disorder Society.

In the overload group, following bilateral tenotomy of plantaris synergists, rats were confined to wheel-cages. Age-matched rats in the control group were confined to plastic cages. During the terminal experiment, muscle action potentials were blocked using It-conotoxin, and full-sized endplate potentials (EPPs) were recorded at 25, 50, and 75 Hz to determine their amplitude rundown. Quantal contents for the control and overload groups were 37.0 and 74.3, respectively (P <0.01). There was a significant group difference in EPP amplitude rundown at all frequencies examined, with increased rundown occurring in the overload group (P < 0.01). Cumulative quantal release was 139% and 153% higher in the overload group at 25 and 50 Hz, respectively (P < 0.05). Together, these data suggest the safety factor for NMT is increased by neuromuscular overload. Furthermore, these findings support and supplement previously reported activity-dependent improvements in NMT efficacy that are probably mediated via presynaptic adaptations.

This completes results for all types of univariate and multivariate image data analysis. All other known univariate and multivariate random field theory results are now special cases, so these new results present a true unification of all currently known results. As an illustration, we use these results in a deformation based morphometry (DBM) analysis to look for regions of the brain where vector deformations of nonmissile trauma patients are related to several verbal memory scores, to detect regions of changes in anatomical effective connectivity between the trauma patients and a group of age- and sex-matched controls, and to look for anatomical connectivity in cortical thickness.

Particularly, the frontal and temporal cortices and amygdala-hippocampal region have been found decreased in volume and density in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies. These abnormalities may reflect an aberrant neuronal network in schizophrenia, suggesting that white matter fibers connecting these regions may also be affected. However, it is unclear if particular white matter areas are (progressively) affected in schizophrenia and if these are related to the gray matter changes. Focal white matter changes in schizophrenia were studied in whole brain magnetic resonance images acquired from 159 patients with schizophrenia or schizophreniform disorder and 158 healthy comparison subjects using voxel-based morphometry. White matter density changes in the patients with schizophrenia were correlated to gray matter density changes and to illness severity. In the patients with schizophrenia, significant decreases in white matter density were found in the genu and truncus of the corpus callosum in the left and right hemisphere, in the right anterior internal capsule and in the right anterior commissure. No interactions between diagnosis and age were found. Increased illness severity was correlated with low density of the corpus callosum and anterior commissure. Decreased corpus callosum density correlated with decreased density of thalamus, lateral inferior frontal and insular gray matter in and with decreased density of medial orbitofrontal and superior temporal gyri in patients. Decreased internal capsule and anterior commissure density correlated with increased caudate, and globus pallidus density in patients and controls. These findings suggest aberrant inter-hemispheric connectivity of anterior cortical and sub-cortical brain regions in schizophrenia, reflecting decreased hemispheric specialisation in schizophrenia.

This symptom burden, a subjective counterpart of tumor burden, causes significant distress. Progress in understanding the mechanisms that underlie these symptoms may lead to new therapies for symptom control. Recently, some of these symptoms have been related to the actions of certain cytokines that produce a constellation of symptoms and behavioral signs when given exogenously to both humans and animals. The cytokine-induced sickness behavior that occurs in animals after the administration of infectious or inflammatory agents or certain proinflammatory cytokines has much in common with the symptoms experienced by cancer patients. Accordingly, we propose that cancer-related symptom clusters share common cytokine-based neuroimmunologic mechanisms. In this review, we provide evidence from clinical and animal studies that correlate the altered cytokine profile with cancer-related symptoms. We also propose that the expression of coexisting symptoms is linked to the deregulated activity of nuclear factor-kappa B, the transcription factor responsible for the production of cytokines and mediators of the inflammatory responses due to cancer and/or cancer treatment. These concepts open exciting new avenues for translational research in the pathophysiology and treatment of cancer-related symptoms. Copyright (C) 2004 S. Karger AG, Basel.

A clear delineation of the developmental potentialities of neuronal support cells in the CNS and PNS might aid in formulating a hypothesis about the origins of myelinating cells. Although a glial-precursor cell in the CNS can differentiate into oligodendrocytes (OLs), Schwann cells (SCs) and astrocytes, a homologous multipotential cell has not yet been found in the PNS. Here, we identify a cell type of embryonic dorsal root ganglia (DRG) of the PNS-the satellite cell-that develops into OLs, SCs and astrocytes. Interestingly, satellite-cell-derived OL precursors were found in cultures prepared from embryonic day17 (E17) to postnatal day8 (P8) ganglia, but not from adult DRGs, revealing a narrow developmental window for multipotentiality. We suggest that compromising the organization of the ganglia triggers a differentiation pathway in a subpopulation of satellite cells, inducing them to become myelinating cells with either a CNS or PNS phenotype. Our data provide an additional, novel piece in the myelinating-cell-precursor puzzle, and lead to the concept that cells in the CNS and PNS that function to ensheath neuronal cell bodies and axons can differentiate into OLs, SCs and astrocytes. In sum, it appears that glial fate might be determined over and above the CNS/PNS dichotomy. Last, we suggest that primordial ensheathing cells form the original cell population in which the myelination program first evolved.

J. Neurosci. 17 (1997) 9308 for experiments made in brain slices). Ictal discharges disappeared within 1-2 h, but were re-established by cutting the Schaffer collaterals, which abolished CA3-driven interictal discharge propagation to EC. In intact slices, GABA(B) receptor activation by baclofen (5-40 muM): (i) depressed CA3-driven interictal activity; and (ii) disclosed non-NMDA glutamatergic receptor-dependent ictal discharges originating in CA3 and propagating to EC. These effects were reversed by the GABA(B) receptor antagonist CGP 35348 (0.5 mM). Application of increasing baclofen doses to slices in which hippocampus and EC networks were surgically isolated decreased epileptiform events with an IC50 that was lower in EC (0.6 muM; n = 12) than in CA3 (2.5 muM; n = 12). Hence, under control conditions, EC ictogenesis depends on NMDA receptor function and is controlled by CA3-driven output activity; in contrast, following GABA(B) receptor activation EC excitability is depressed to a greater extent than CA3, which leads to non-NMDA glutamatergic receptor-mediated ictogenesis in CA3. We propose that GABA(B) receptor modulation may represent an important mechanism for setting the site of initiation, the modalities of propagation and the glutamatergic receptor properties of ictogenesis in the limbic system and, perhaps, in mesial temporal lobe epilepsy patients.

Generation of the Ne/ERN has been associated with structures in the prefrontal cortex, especially the anterior cingulate region, but also the supplementary motor cortex and subcortical structures. There is some controversy as to whether the Ne/ERN is a necessary concomitant to error detection. We examined the Ne/ERN in five patients with damage to the medial prefrontal cortex, including the anterior cingulate region. Our findings support the implication of the rostral anterior cingulate in Ne/ERN production, but they also show that subjects can be aware of errors and yet not produce an Ne/ERN. Thus, error detection leads to the Ne/ERN process and damage to the anterior cingulate region may interrupt this relay, suggesting that error detection may be supported by circuits outside the anterior cingulate region.

In the context of recent findings that the performance of individuals with HFA was superior to typically developing individuals in several non-social cognitive operations, it was expected that the HFA group would outperform a typically developing comparison group matched on full-scale IQ. Results showed that individuals with autism performed all spatial tasks at a level at least equivalent to the typically developing comparison group. No differences between groups were found in route and survey tasks. Superior performance for individuals with HFA was found in tasks involving maps, in the form of superior accuracy in graphic cued recall of a path, and shorter learning times in a map learning task. We propose that a superior ability to detect [Human Perception and Performance 27 (3) (2001) 719], match [Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry 34 (1993) 1351] and reproduce [Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry 40 (5) (1999) 743] simple visual elements yields superior performance in tasks relying on the detection and graphic reproduction of the visual elements composing a map. Enhanced discrimination, detection, and memory for visually simple patterns in autism may account for the superior performance of persons with autism on visuo-spatial tasks that heavily involve pattern recognition, either in the form of recognizing and memorizing landmarks or in detecting the similarity between map and landscape features. At a neuro-anatomical level, these findings suggest an intact dorso-lateral pathway, and enhanced performance in non social tasks relying on the infero-temporal pathway. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

In contrast with reaction time (RT) studies, the dependent variable of interest in IT is not related to the motoric speed with which the individual is able to respond, but rather the minimum presentation time necessary for participants to reliably identify physical properties of the stimulus. It is well documented that individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD) experience significant impairment on tests of simple RT, but it is unclear whether such deficits can be interpreted as `pure' slowness of information processing, or a delay in the selection and output of a motor response. In the first experiment described here, a sample of `optimally medicated' PD patients was compared with an age-matched control group, on an IT task. Results of this experiment suggested that individuals with PD required significantly longer stimulus presentation times than healthy participants. The second experiment compared a sample of PD patients (tested both "ON" and "OFF" their typical dopaminergic medications), with an age-matched control group, on the same test of IT. Results again indicated a significant IT deficit in participants with PD, and suggested that these deficits do not significantly resolve with levodopa treatment. Overall, the results of these two experiments suggest that information processing deficits associated with PD are distinct from motor impairment. These findings are further discussed in terms of existing neurochemical models of information processing ability. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Participants with moderate musical background were scanned while, making similarity judgments about the timbre of heard or imagined musical instrument sounds. The critical control condition was a visual imagery task. The pattern of judgments in perceived and imagined conditions was similar, suggesting that perception and imagery access similar cognitive representations of timbre. As expected, judgments of heard timbres, relative to the visual imagery control, activated primary and secondary auditory areas with some right-sided asymmetry. Timbre imagery also activated secondary auditory areas relative to the visual imagery control, although less strongly, in accord with previous data. Significant overlap was observed in these regions between perceptual and imagery conditions. Because the visual control task resulted in deactivation of auditory areas relative to a silent baseline, we interpret the timbre imagery effect as a reversal of that deactivation. Despite the lack of an obvious subvocalization component to timbre imagery, some activity in SMA was observed, suggesting that SMA may have a more general role in imagery beyond any motor component.

Human studies are limited and restricted by the paucity of safe NMDA antagonists. Here, we investigated the contribution of glutamatergic neurotransmission to the capacity of acquiring motor-adaptation learning in humans. In a double-blind design, 200 mg of amantadine (a low-affinity NMDA receptor channel blocker) or a matching placebo were given orally to groups of 14 and 13 human healthy young volunteers, respectively. Blood samples were collected 3 h after treatment to assay plasma concentrations, and the subjects were then tested using a motor-adaptation paradigm consisting of an eight-target-pointing task. To rule out drug-related generalized impairments such sedation, tests measuring motor dexterity and attention were also administered pre- and post-treatment. Comparison of the mean performance levels on the motor-adaptation task revealed that subjects in the amantadine group performed at a lower level than those in the placebo group, but this difference did not reach significance. Interestingly, however, despite plasma amantadine concentrations being relatively low, ranging from 2.09 to 4.74 muM (mean=3.3 muM), they nevertheless correlated negatively with motor learning. Furthermore, when the amantadine group was divided into low-performance and high-performance subgroups, subjects in the former subgroup displayed mean amantadine concentrations 36% higher than the latter subgroup, and performed significantly worser than the placebo group. No change in performance was found on the motor-dexterity and attention tests. Altogether, our results lend support to the hypothesis that normal NMDA receptor function is necessary for the acquisition of motor adaptation.

The perirhinal cortex (PRC) represents one of the main conduits for the bi-directional flow of information between the entorhinal-hippocampal network and the cortical mantle, a process essential in memory formation. However, despite anatomical evidence for a robust reciprocal connectivity between the perirhinal and entorhinal cortices, neurophysiological understanding of this circuitry is lacking. We now present the results of a series of electrophysiological experiments in rats that demonstrate robust synaptic activation patterns of the perirhinal-entorhinal inter-connections. First, using silicon multi-electrode arrays placed under visual guidance in vivo we performed current source density (CSD) analysis of lateral entorhinal cortex (LEG) responses to PRC stimulation, which demonstrated a current sink in layers II-III of the LEC with a latency consistent with monosynaptic activation. To further substantiate and extend this conclusion, we developed a PRC-LEC slice preparation where CSD analysis also revealed a current sink in superficial LEC layers in response to PRC stimulation. Importantly, intracellular recording of superficial LEC layer neurons confirmed that they receive a major monosynaptic excitatory input from the PRC. Finally, CSD analysis of the LEC to PRC projection in vivo also allowed us to document robust feedback synaptic activation of PRC neurons to deep LEC layer activation. We conclude that a clear bidirectional pattern of synaptic interactions exists between the PRC and LEC that would support a dynamic flow of information subserving memory function in the temporal lobe.

This capacity critically depends on the development of the prefrontal cortex (PFC). The present functional magnetic resonance imaging study was conducted to identify the neural circuitry underlying voluntary self-regulation of sadness in healthy girls (aged 8-10). A 2x2 factorial design was implemented with Emotion (No Sadness vs. Sadness) and Regulation (No Reappraisal vs. Reappraisal) as factors. In the No Reappraisal conditions, subjects were instructed to react normally to neutral and sad film excerpts whereas in the Reappraisal conditions, subjects were asked to voluntarily suppress any emotional reaction in response to comparable stimuli. A significant interaction of the Emotion and Regulation factors revealed that reappraisal of sad film excerpts was associated with bilateral activations of the lateral PFC (LPFC; Brodmann areas [BA] 9 and 10), orbitofrontal cortex (OFC; BA 11), and medial PFC (BA 9 and 10). Significant loci of activations were also detected in the right anterior cingulate cortex (BA 24/32) and right ventrolateral PFC (BA 47). In an identical study previously conducted by our group in adult women [Biol Psychiatry 53 (2003) 502], reappraisal of sad film excerpts was associated with activation of the right OFC (BA 11) and right LPFC (BA 9). The greater number of prefrontal loci of activation found in children relative to adults during voluntary self-regulation of sadness may be related to the immaturity of the prefrontolimbic connections in childhood.

To address this, we have studied transgenic rats expressing Alzheimer's-related transgenes that accumulate Abeta intraneuronally in the cerebral and hippocampal cortices but do not develop extracellular amyloid plaques. In these rats, the presence of intraneuronal Abeta is sufficient to provoke up-regulation of the phosphorylated form of extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK) 2 and its enzymatic activity in the hippocampus while no changes were observed in the activity or phosphorylation status of other putative tau kinases such as p38, glycogen synthase kinase 3, and cycline-dependent kinase 5. The increase in active phospho-ERK2 was accompanied by increased levels of tau phosphorylation at S396 and S404 ERK2 sites and a decrease in the phosphorylation of the CREB kinase p90RSK. In a water maze paradigm, male transgenic rats displayed a mild spatial learning deficit relative to control littermates. Our results suggest that in the absence of plaques, intraneuronal accumulation of Abeta peptide correlates with the initial steps in the tau-phosphorylation cascade, alterations in ERK2 signaling and impairment of higher CNS functions in male rats.

In addition, both the BF and adjacent preoptic area (POA) contain neurons that promote sleep. We examined c-Fos expression in cholinergic and GABAergic neurons in the BF and POA to determine whether they are differentially active following sleep deprivation versus recovery and whether the GABAergic neurons are active during sleep. Whereas the numbers of c-Fos+ cells and proportions of c-Fos+ cells that were cholinergic were decreased, the proportions that were GABAergic were increased following sleep recovery across BF and POA nuclei. Moreover, the sleep-active GABAergic neurons were immuno-stained for alpha(2A)-adrenergic receptors. We conclude that GABAergic neurons that commonly bear alpha(2)-adrenergic receptors comprise sleep-active cells of the BF and POA. These GABAergic cells would be inhibited by noradrenaline (NA) released from locus coeruleus neurons during waking; they would be disinhibited through diminished NA release during drowsiness and thus become active to promote sleep by inhibiting in turn wake-promoting neurons.

Anatomical tracers were applied in the posterior (PRRN) and middle rhombencephalic reticular nuclei as well as to the proximal stumps of cut vestibular nerve branches to identify the neurons projecting to the reticular nuclei that were in close proximity with vestibular primary afferents. Labeled neurons were found in the intermediate (ION) and posterior (PON) octavomotor nuclei, and were more numerous on the side of the injection (around 56-87 and 101-107 for the ION and the PON, respectively). Morphologies varied but cells were mostly round or oval. Axonal projections from the PON formed a dense bundle, whereas those from the ION were less densely packed. Based on their morphology and the distribution of their projections, most vestibulo-reticular neurons were presumed to be vestibulospinal cells. Reticulospinal cells from the PRRN were recorded intracellularly in the in vitro brainstem-spinal cord preparation and large excitatory post-synaptic potentials (EPSPs) were evoked following stimulation of the ipsilateral anterior and the contralateral posterior branches of the vestibular nerves, whereas inhibitory post-synaptic potentials (IPSPs) or smaller EPSPs were elicited by stimulation of the ipsilateral posterior or of the contralateral anterior branches. During fictive locomotion, both the excitatory and the inhibitory responses displayed phasic changes in amplitude such that the amplitude of the EPSPs was minimal when the spinal cord activity switched from the ipsilateral to the contralateral side of the recorded reticulospinal cell. The IPSPs were then of maximal amplitude. We propose that this modulation could serve to reduce the influence of vestibular inputs in response to head movements during locomotion. (C) 2004 IBRO.

Most cases of NP-C are caused by inactivating mutations of the npc1 gene, but about 5% are linked to npc2, which encodes a soluble cholesterol binding protein, previously identified as epididymal secretory glycoprotein 1 (He1). The present study was carried out to investigate the immunocytochemical localization of HE1/NPC2 protein in the mouse brain. Using an antibody against recombinant HE1/NPC2, we found HE1/NPC2 to be localized predominantly in neurons in the brain. Immunoreactivity for HE1/NPC2 was observed in pyramidal or projection neurons in the cerebral cortex and amygdala, and Purkinje neurons in the cerebellum. Neurons in the thalamus, hypothalamus, and globus pallidus were lightly labeled, or unlabeled. This regional pattern of expression of HE1/ NPC2 is similar to our previous findings with NPC1, with a low level of expression of both NPC1 and HE1/NPC2 proteins in regions derived from the diencephalon, such as the thalamus and hypothalamus. In contrast to NPC1, however, which is predominantly in astrocytes, HE1/NPC2 was observed mainly in neurons. Electron microscopic immunocytochemistry showed that HE1/NPC2 is present in the cytosol of dendrites and on post-synaptic densities (PSD). The occurrence of HE1/NPC2 in the PSD was confirmed by Western blots of PSD-enriched brain subcellular fractions that showed the presence of HE1/NPC2 together with the PSD-associated protein, PSD-95. These results suggest that NPC1 and HE1/NPC2 are differentially enriched in astrocytes and neurons, respectively, and that HE1/ NPC2 may function in supporting the integrity of the PSD of neurons.

Radioenzymatically determined choline acetyl transferase (ChAT) activity was elevated in the septum at day 5, but reduced in the dorsal hippocampus at days 3, 5 and 7, after axotomy. Prominent accumulation of calpain-, but not caspase-3-, cleaved spectrin proteolytic fragments was observed in both the septum and dorsal hippocampus 1-7 days after axotomy. ChAT-positive neuronal cell bodies in the septum also displayed calpain-cleaved spectrin indicating that calpain activation occurred in cholinergic septal neurons as a consequence of transection of the septohippocampal pathway. Calpain-cleaved (alphall-spectrin immunoreactivity was observed in cholinergic fibers coursing through the fimbria-fornix, but not in pyramidal neurons of the dorsal hippocampus, suggesting that degenerating cholinergic nerve terminals were the source of calpain activity in the dorsal hippocampus following axotomy. Accumulation of calpain-cleaved spectrin proteolytic fragments in the dorsal hippocampus and septum at day 5 after axotomy was reduced by i.c.v. administration of two calpain inhibitors. Calpain inhibition partially reduced the elevation of ChAT activity in the septum produced by transection but failed to decrease the loss of ChAT activity in the dorsal hippocampus following axotomy. These findings suggest that calpain activation contributes to the cholinergic cell body response and hippocampal axonal cytoskeletal degradation produced by transection of the septohippocampal pathway.

The pathways that transmit auditory conditioned stimulus information originate in auditory processing regions of the thalamus and cortex, but the pathways mediating transmission of unconditioned stimuli to the amygdala are poorly understood. Recent studies suggest that somatosensory (footshock) unconditioned stimulus information is also relayed in parallel to the lateral nucleus of the amygdala from the thalamus (the posterior intralaminar thalamic complex, PIT) and the cortex (parietal insular cortex). In the present study we reexamined this issue. Our results showed that bilateral electrolytic lesions of the PIT alone blocked fear conditioning, whereas bilateral excitotoxic PIT lesions had no effect. These electrolytic PIT lesions did not affect fear conditioning using a loud noise as unconditioned stimulus, defining the effects of PIT lesions as a disruption of somatosensory as opposed to auditory processing. Finally, we performed combined bilateral excitotoxic lesions of the PIT nuclei and electrolytic lesions of the parietal insular cortex. These, like excitotoxic lesions of PIT alone, had no effect on the acquisition of fear conditioning. Thus, somatosensory regions of the thalamus and cortex may well be important routes of unconditioned stimulus transmission to the amygdala in fear conditioning, but information about the unconditioned somatosensory stimulus is also transmitted from other sources that send fibers through, but do not form essential synapses in, the thalamus en route to the amygdala.

However, the role of this hormone and the distribution of its receptor subtypes have not yet been defined in neural structures of the human fetus. We have analyzed four neural tissues (CNS, hypothalamus, pituitary and spinal cord) from early to midgestation for the expression of five human SSTR mRNAs, using a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and Southern blot approach. These fetal neural tissues all express mRNA for multiple SSTR subtypes from as early as 16 weeks of fetal life but the developmental patterns of expression vary considerably. Transcripts for SSTR1 and SSTR2A are the most widely distributed, being expressed in all four neural tissues. SSTR2A is often the earliest transcript to be detected (7.5 weeks in CNS). SSTR3 mRNA is confined to the pituitary, hypothalamus, and spinal cord. SSTR4 is expressed in fetal brain, hypothalamus and spinal cord but not pituitary. SSTR5 mRNA is detectable in the pituitary and spinal cord by 14-16 weeks of fetal life. This mapping of SSTR mRNA expression patterns in human fetal neural tissues is an important first step toward our goal of determining the role of SST in the nervous system during early stages in human development.

These symptoms undergo compensation over time. Here we used changes in the expression of two immediate-early gene (IEG) products to identify cellular and molecular changes occurring in autonomic brainstem regions of adult male albino rats killed at different times during the Neurolab Space Mission (STS-90). Both direct effects of gravitational changes, as well as indirect effects of gravitational changes on responses to light exposure were examined. Regions under the direct control of vestibular afferents such as the area postrema and the caudal part of the nucleus of the tractus solitarius (NTSC) were both directly and indirectly affected by gravity changes. These areas showed no changes in the expression of IEG products during exposure to microgravity with respect to ground controls, but did show a significant increase 24 h after return to 1 G (gravity). Exposure to microgravity significantly inhibited gene responses to light exposure seen after return to 1 G. A similar direct and indirect response pattern was also shown by the central nucleus of the amygdala, a basal forebrain structure anatomically and functionally related to the NTS. The rostral part of the NTS (NTSR) receives different afferent projections than the NTSC. This region did not show any direct gravity-related changes in IEG expression, but showed an indirect effect of gravity on IEG responses to light. A similar pattern was also obtained in the intermediate reticular nucleus and the parvocellular reticular nucleus. Two other medullary reticular structures, the dorsal and the ventral medullary reticular nuclei showed a less well defined pattern of responses that differed from those seen in the NTSC and NTSR. The short- and long-lasting molecular changes in medullary and basal forebrain gene expression described here are thought to play an important role in the integration of autonomic and vestibular signals that ultimately regulate neural adaptations to space flight.

In order to examine how binocular fusion is affected by spatial frequency differences, we have recorded cells in the border region of areas 17/18 of anesthetized cats. The optic axes of the eyes were deviated onto cathode-ray screens, and the optimal spatial frequency of each eye was assessed by monocular stimulations using drifting sinusoidal gratings. The optimal relative phase using identical spatial frequencies in both eyes was first determined. Spatial frequency differences were then introduced by keeping the optimal spatial frequency constant in one eye and varying the spatial frequency in the other. Results indicate that cells (39%) responded with an increased firing rate (facilitation) to similar spatial frequencies in each eye and with a gradual attenuation (occlusion or suppression) when spatial frequency differences were increased. However, binocular facilitation did not always occur to the presentation of identical stimuli. For 16% of the cells, maximal responses were observed when lower spatial frequencies than the optimal one were presented in one eye while higher spatial frequencies produced suppression. The opposite pattern was observed only for two cells. These findings are discussed in terms of binocular fusion and suppression. (C) 2004 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Of the six areas originally described by Palmer et al. [J Comp Neurol 177 (1978) 237], the posteromedial lateral suprasylvian (PMLS) cortex has attracted the greatest attention. Very little physiological information is available concerning other suprasylvian visual areas, and in particular, the anteromedial lateral suprasylvian cortex (AMLS). Based on its cortical and sub-cortical connectivity patterns, the AMLS cortex is a likely candidate for higher-order motion processing in cat visual cortex. We have investigated this possibility by studying the receptive field sensitivity of AMLS neurons to complex motion stimuli. Neurons in AMLS cortex exhibited large (mean of 354degrees(2)) and complex-like receptive fields, and most of them (74%) were classified as direction selective on the basis of their responses to sinusoidal drifting gratings. Most importantly, direction selectivity was present for complex motion stimuli. A subset of the neurons sampled (eight of 38 cells; 21%) exhibited pattern-motion selectivity in response to moving plaid patterns. The capacity of AMLS neurons to signal higher-order stimuli was further supported by their selectivity to moving complex random-dot kinematograms. Finally, 45% of 20 neurons were direction selective to a radial optic flow stimulus. Overall, these results suggest that AMLS cortex is involved in higher-order analyses of visual motion. It is possible that the AMLS cortex represents a region between PMLS and the anterior ectosylvian visual area in a functional hierarchy of areas involved in motion integration. (C) 2003 IBRO.

J	De Guzman, P; D'Antuono, M; Avoli, M				De Guzman, P; D'Antuono, M; Avoli, M			Initiation of electrographic seizures by neuronal networks in entorhinal and perirhinal cortices in vitro	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						perirhinal cortex; entorhinal cortex; epileptiform; activity; ictal activity; parahippocampus	GABA-MEDIATED POTENTIALS; TEMPORAL-LOBE EPILEPSY; GUINEA-PIG; EPILEPTIFORM DISCHARGES; FOCAL EPILEPTOGENESIS; GLUTAMATE RECEPTORS; INTERICTAL SPIKES; SLICE PREPARATION; LIMBIC SEIZURES; KINDLED RATS	The hippocampus is often considered to play a major role in the pathophysiology of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. However, emerging clinical and experimental evidence suggests that parahippocampal areas may contribute to a greater extent to limbic seizure initiation, and perhaps epileptogenesis. To date, little is known about the participation of entorhinal and perirhinal networks to epileptiform synchronization. Here, we addressed this issue by using simultaneous field potential recordings in horizontal rat brain slices containing interconnected limbic structures that included the hippocampus proper. Epileptiform discharges were disclosed by bath applying the convulsant drug 4-aminopyridine (50 muM) or by superfusing Mg(2+)-free medium. In the presence of 4-aminopyridine, slow interictal- (duration=2.34+/-0.29 s; interval of occurrence=25.75+/-2.11 s, n=16) and ictal-like (duration=31.25+/-3.34 s; interval of occurrence=196.96+/-21.56 s, n=17) discharges were recorded in entorhinal and perirhinal cortices after abating the propagation of CA3-driven interictal activity to these areas following extended hippocampal knife cuts. Simultaneous recordings obtained from the medial and lateral entorhinal cortex, and from the perirhinal cortex revealed that interictal and ictal discharges could initiate from any of these areas and propagate to the neighboring structure with delays of 8-66 ms. However, slow interictal- and ictal-like events more often originated in the medial entorhinal cortex and perirhinal cortex, respectively. Cutting the connections between entorhinal and perirhinal cortices (n=10), or functional inactivation of cortical areas by local application of a glutamatergic receptor antagonist (n=11) made independent epileptiform activity occur in all areas. These procedures also shortened ictal discharge duration in the entorhinal cortices, but not in the perirhinal area. Similar results could be obtained by applying Mg(2+)-free medium (n=7). These findings indicate that parahippocampal networks provide independent epileptiform synchronization sufficient to sustain limbic seizures as well as that the perirhinal cortex plays a preferential role in in vitro ictogenesis.

Patients and Methods: Two hundred fifty five patients aged 20 years or older, with stable bladders on multichannel urodynamics, without known neurological pathology, and with no previous history of pelvic or anti-incontinence surgery were included in the study. Resting urethral pressure profile (UPP) and the grade of urethral incompetence was registered. Results: Mean age of the group was 45.6 +/- 12.7 years; mean MUCP was 62.7 +/- 28.5 cm of water. There was a statistically significant difference in the MUCP when the different grades of urethral incompetence were compared to each other, the higher grades being associated with a lower maximal closure pressure. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that there is a highly significant relationship between MUCP and between all grades of urethral incompetence. This supports previous observations that MUCP decreases when abdominal leak point pressure (ALPP) is low and that this might be secondary to some mechanical failure in the pressure transmission from the abdominal cavity to the urethra. Studies should never compare continent to incontinent cohorts without considering their ALPP because in doing so they are comparing groups that are functionally heterogeneous.

Patients and Methods: A group of 255 patients was selected from a large bank of cases. Inclusion criteria were age 20 years or above, no neurological disease, stable bladder, and no previous incontinence surgery or hysterectomy. The degree of hypermobility (cysto-urethrocele) and the degree of urethral incompetence (abdominal leak point pressure (ALPP)) were determined. Statistical analyses between urethral hypermobility and incompetence were performed with Spearman's correlation and the Jonckherre-Terpstra test. Results: The Spearman's rank correlation test showed a statistically significant relation between urethral hypermobility and the degree of urethral incompetence (P = 0.0049). Conclusions: The statistically significant relation between urethral incompetence and hypermobility suggests that urethral incompetence will increase as the degree of urethral hypermobility does. Optimal conditions for urinary continence include a high maximum urethral closure pressure, absence of hypermobility, and a low degree of urethral incompetence. This last factor is assured by a strong support underneath the urethra permitting compression of the latter during straining. Failure of the urethral closure mechanism is highly probable with a diminished maximum closure pressure accompanied by urethral hypermobility often associated with a high degree of urethral incompetence. Clinically significant urinary incontinence may appear in many intermediate circumstances between these two extreme states, but stress urinary incontinence is essentially an activity-related phenomenon.

Stimulation of p75(NTR) with neurotrophin can activate multiple downstream signals, including the small GTP binding protein Rac, the transcription factor NF-kappaB and the stress activated kinase, JNK. How these signals are generated and regulated to produce a specific cellular effect has yet to be fully elucidated. A number of proteins have recently been shown to interact with the intracellular domain of p75(NTR). Here, we review these p75(NTR) interacting factors and the current evidence as to how they contribute to the functional effects of p75(NTR) activation.

Moreover, the interaction can be homotypic, implying that astrocyte-derived secreted molecules affect their adjacent neurons optimally vs remote neurons. Astrocytes produce neurotrophic and extracellular matrix molecules that affect neuronal growth, development and survival, synaptic development, stabilization and functioning, and neurogenesis. This new knowledge offers the opportunity of developing astrocyte-derived, secreted proteins as a new class of therapeutics specifically to treat diseases of the CNS. However, primary astrocytes proliferate slowly in vitro, and when induced to immortalize by genetic manipulation, tend to lose their phenotype. These problems have limited the development of astrocytes as sources of potential drug candidates. We have successfully developed a method to induce spontaneous immortalization of astrocytes. Gene expression analysis, karyotyping and activity profiling data show that these spontaneously immortalized type-1 astrocyte cell lines retain the properties of their primary parents. The method is generic, such that cell lines can be prepared from any region of the CNS. To date, a library of 70 cell lines from four regions of the CNS: ventral mesencephalon, striatum, cerebral cortex and hippocampus, has been created. A phenotype-selective neurotrophic factor for dopaminergic neurons has been discovered from one of the cell lines (VMCL1). This mesencephalic astrocyte-derived neurotrophic factor (MANF) is a 20 kD, glycosylated, human secreted protein. Homologs of this protein have been identified in 16 other species including C. elegans.

This paper first describes the failed application of neural network - hidden Markov model hybrid recognizer on Chinese bank check legal amount recognition, and explains the reasons for the failure: the neural network - hidden Markov model hybrid recognizer can not handle the complexity in the training for Chinese legal amounts. Then a spiral recognition methodology is presented. This methodology enables the system to increase its recognition power (both the recognition rate and the number of recognized characters) during the training iterations. Some experiments were done to show that the spiral recognition methodology has a high performance in the recognition of unconstrained handwritten Chinese legal amounts. The recognition rate at the character level is 93.5%, and the recognition rate at the legal amount level is 60%. Combined with the recognition of courtesy amount, the overall error rate is less than 1%.

The hybrid features consist of one set of two dimensional complex wavelet transform (2D-CWT) coefficients and one set of geometrical features. As 2D-CWT does not only keep wavelet transform's properties of multiresolution decomposition analysis and perfect reconstruction, but also adds its new merits: its magnitudes being insensitive to the small image shifts and multiple directional selectivity, which are useful for handwritten numeral feature extraction. Experiments demonstrated that the features extracted by our proposed method can make the ANN classifier more reliable and convergence easily. A high verification performance has been observed in the series of experiments on handwritten numeral pairs and clusters.

In spite of its potential therapeutic benefits, known adverse effects associated with the drug limit its widespread utilization. In this study artificial cell alginate-chitosan (AC) membrane microcapsules containing thalidomide have been designed and their drug release characteristics and effectiveness for targeted thalidomide gastrointestinal (GI) delivery has been evaluated. Results show that AC capsule thalidomide release was immediate. In the absence of degradation, no release of the drug takes place from the microcapsules. Thus, microencapsulation of thalidomide for targeted delivery in Crohn's disease is possible and will be advantageous. However, further study is required.

An initial pool of 34 items was subjected to reliability and item analyses with 282 participants. From these analyses, a final scale of 12 items for CSC and 10 items for ISC was developed. These scales were then validated with 144 participants. As predicted, CSC and ISC were moderately correlated with each other. Each scale was uniquely and predictably related to other measures of personality, attachment, and conflict resolution, and these relationships did not appear to be primarily due to general relationships with Neuroticism.

The analysis of 201 children treated with methotrexate for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL) showed that patients with either the MTHFR T677A1298 haplotype or MTHFD1 A1958 variant had a lower probability of event-free survival (EFS) in univariate analysis ( hazard ratio (HR) = 2.2, 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.0 - 4.7 and 2.8, 95% CI, 1.1 - 7.3, respectively). Multivariate analysis supported only the role of the MTHFR variant ( HR = 2.2, 95% CI, 0.9 - 5.6). However, the association of both genes with ALL outcome appears to be more obvious in the presence of another event-predisposing variant belonging to the same path of drug action. The combined effect of a thymidylate synthase (TS) triple repeat associated with increased TS levels, with either the MTHFR T677A1298 haplotype or MTHFD1 A1958 allele, resulted in a highly significant reduction of EFS (multivariate HR = 9.0, 95% CI, 1.9 - 42.8 and 8.9, 95% CI, 1.8 - 44.6, respectively). These results reveal the role of gene - gene interactions within a folate pathway, and how they can correlate with relapse probabilities in ALL patients.

Representative case reports are discussed, with demonstration of dissemination in space and time with MRI. Guidelines for reporting MRI examinations in patients with MS are also given. MS is a chronic disease of the CNS characterised by discrete areas of demyelination and axon injury associated with inflammatory activity. A key defining feature of MS is that lesions are disseminated in both space and time. They occur at more than one site and develop on more than one occasion. Detection of lesions with MRI can provide evidence of dissemination in both time and space. The goal of this presentation is to review the role of MRI in diagnosis of MS within the diagnostic scheme proposed by McDonald et al (1), and discuss performance of the examinations and reporting of results.

B	Klein, D			medimond	Klein, D			Neurocognitive sciences - Research: Functional neuroimaging of language	PROCEEDINGS OF THE 23RD INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS OF RADIOLOGY OF THE INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY OF RADIOLOGY			English	Proceedings Paper	23rd International Congress of Radiology/22nd Interamerican Congress of Radiology	JUN 25-29, 2004	Montreal, CANADA	Int Soc Radiol			HEMIPLEGIC CHILDREN; HEMISPHERE; INJURY	Functional neuroimaging techniques are powerful tools for mapping patterns of brain activation associated with language processing. The research presented examines the specific functions of the different brain regions involved in language processing. The work embodies a cognitive neuroscience approach by combining behavioural methods with functional neuroimaging (PET and fMRI) and takes advantage of the multilingual environment of Quebec to investigate how neural systems change with development and exposure to one or more languages. The research explores subcomponents of the linguistic system in healthy volunteers in order to achieve greater anatomical specificity in the mapping of language functions onto the brain. The focus has been to transfer developments in the functional mapping of language in normal subjects to the evaluation of patients who are candidates for brain surgery. The studies examine the reliability of language activation patterns using functional brain imaging in patients with different brain lesions. The work aims to advance the understanding of brain function as it relates to neurological diseases. The dominance of one cerebral hemisphere for language is the most salient and most cited cognitive asymmetry between the cerebral hemispheres (Hellige, 1993). Language is lateralized to the left hemisphere in most people, both left and right-handers (Milner et al, 1964). In individuals with early lesions of the left hemisphere, acquired either prenatally or in early childhood, the right hemisphere can support normal or near normal development of language (Rasmussen and Milner, 1977; Isaacs et al, 1996; Muter et al, 1997). This ability of the right leagues, Dr Andre Olivier, Dr Abbas Sadikot, and Dr Rolando Del Maestro, we have begun to correlate brain regions activated on specific neuroirnaging language tasks with cortical stimulation mapping in order to isolate brain areas differentially involved with these tasks. This is important because functional neuroirnaging results do not allow a clear distinction between regional neuronal activations that are indispensable for a given cognitive process and those that are only facilitative; discrimination between essential and non-essential structures is not possible using imaging alone. Therefore, integration of data obtained by the "deficit methods" and imaging is desirable. Electrocortical stimulation mapping is currently the gold standard of intraoperative functional cortical mapping (ICS) because it has been shown to be a good predictor of the effects of resection (Haglund et al,. 1994). The validity of preoperative functional imaging for surgical planning has yet to be fully validated, especially in patients with different types of lesions (Puratian et al, 2002). In our work, we have obtained preliminary results to suggest that functional areas involved in different aspects of linguistic processing are dissociable, and that specific disruption by intraoperative cortical stimulation mapping can be correlated with the brain regions identified by PET as the most active during performance of a specific task. In several cases, comparison of presurgical language mapping with PET and electrical stimulation of the cortex under local anesthesia provided converging evidence to validate the neuroiniaging results. In summary, the main goals of this work have been to look at individual variability and reliability of language activation patterns using PET and fMRI in healthy controls and in patients with well-documented brain lesions. The research is aimed to advance the understanding of brain function as it relates to normal development and skilled performance and to neurological diseases.

The earliest PET scans of cerebral tumours, infarcts, and angiomas were obtained in 1975 by using positron emitting Gallium-68 and a 32-detector sodium iodide array. In 1978, at the 1(st) International Symposium on PET in Montreal, the MNI team designed a prototype scanner of 64 bismuth germanate detectors, a model adopted by later commercial scanners. In 1981 we acquired a prototype Baby Cyclotron from Japan that produced positron-emitting carbon, oxygen, nitrogen and fluorine, making possible a full range of PET applications to study cerebrovascular disorders, metabolic features of gliomas and monitoring of anti-tumour drug uptake, selected neurotransmitters and localization of cerebral functions. From 1984, a Philips GYROSCAN 1.5 tesla magnetic resonance system has provided, by merging MRI/PET images, a precise anatomical substrate for PET studies.

PROCEEDINGS OF THE MENTAL DYSFUNCTIONS IN PARKINSON'S DISEASE			English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Mental Dysfunctions in Parkinsons Disease	OCT 24-27, 2004	Salzburg, AUSTRIA				SCHIZOPHRENIA; DYSFUNCTION	Mild executive dysfunctions are known to exist in PD. However, their prevalence and day to day impacts are not known. A recent study conducted in our movement disorder center revealed that up to 61% of the PD patients without dementia have such executive dysfunctions as assessed with standard neuropsychological tests. Ten female patients from this sample (stages I to III) participated in an experiment requiring the preparation of a meal. Their behaviors were scored according to a scale based on the optimal sequence of actions that must be accomplished. Results revealed a significant disorganization of the meal preparation in PD patients, when compared with 10 normal controls. This was apparent in the number of meal planning errors (p <.01), dishes switching errors (p <.01), and non-optimal cooking verifications (p <.01). Correlation analysis revealed that neuropsychological tasks of planning and attention, have good predictive values, while motor scales, age, and education do not. We concluded that the so called mild executive dysfunctions in PD may have a significant detrimental impact on daily activities.

The controversy seems to stem from uncontrolled factors including the lack of objective measures, the practice effect in a test-retest design, and the absence of plasmatic dosage. This study aimed at further controlling these factors using transdermal nicotine in PD. Methods: Twenty-two nonsmoking PD patients received a transdermal nicotine treatment over 25 days in increasing titrated doses. Motor and cognitive assessments were carried out on days 11 and 25 (low-dose and high-dose assessments, respectively) and after a 14-day washout period. Results: Patients tolerated nicotine poorly. Thirteen (59%) withdrew, mostly because of acute side effects. In the remaining nine patients, nicotine neither improved nor worsened motor or cognitive functioning in comparison with 10 age, gender and education matched controls. Conclusions: Transdermal nicotine is not effective in treating motor and cognitive deficits in PD. The results obtained with our objective measures confirm a recent double-blind, placebo-controlled study that used clinical measures. It is possible that nicotine lacks specificity in targeting critical nicotinic receptors that might be involved in PD pathophysiology. The low tolerability may be related to such a lack of specificity of nicotine, which would directly stimulate the autonomic nervous system. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

We systematically reviewed available evidence concerning the effects on child health, growth, and development and on maternal health of exclusive breastfeeding for 6 months vs. exclusive breastfeeding for 3-4 months followed by mixed breastfeeding (introduction of complementary liquid or solid foods with continued breastfeeding) to 6 months. Two independent literature searches were conducted, together comprising the following databases: MEDLINE (as of 1966), Index Medicus (prior to 1966), CINAHL, HealthSTAR, BIOSIS, CAB Abstracts, EMBASE-Medicine, EMBASE-Psychology, Econlit, Index Medicus for the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region, African Index Medicus, Lilacs (Latin American and Carribean literature), EBM Reviews-Best Evidence, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register. No language restrictions were imposed. The two searches yielded a total of 2,668 unique citations. Contacts with experts in the field yielded additional published and unpublished studies. Studies were stratified according to study design (controlled trials vs. observational studies) and provenance (developing vs. developed countries). The main outcome measures were weight and length gain, weight-for-age and length-for-age z-scores, head circumference, iron status, gastrointestinal and respiratory infectious morbidity, atopic eczema, asthma, neuromotor development, duration of lactational amenorrhea, and maternal postpartum weight loss. Twenty independent studies meeting the selection criteria were identified by the literature search: 9 from developing countries (2 of which were controlled trials in Honduras) and 11 from developed countries (all observational studies). Neither the trials nor the observational studies suggest that infants who continue to be exclusively breastfed for 6 months show deficits in weight or length gain, although larger sample sizes would be required to rule out modest increases in the risk of undernutrition. The data are conflicting with respect to iron status but suggest that, at least in developing-country settings, where iron stores of newborn infants may be suboptimal, exclusive breastfeeding without iron supplementation through 6 months of age may compromise hematologic status. Based primarily on an observational analysis of a large randomized trial in Belarus, infants who continue exclusive breastfeeding for 6 months or more appear to have a significantly reduced risk of one or more episodes of gastrointestinal tract infection. No significant reduction in risk of atopic eczema, asthma, or other atopic outcomes has been demonstrated in studies from Finland, Australia, and Belarus. Data from the two Honduran trials suggest that exclusive breastfeeding through 6 months of age is associated with delayed resumption of menses and more rapid postpartum weight loss in the mother. Infants who are breastfed exclusively for 6 months experience less morbidity from gastrointestinal tract infection than infants who were mixed breastfed as of 3 or 4 months of age. No deficits have been demonstrated in growth among infants from either developing or developed countries who are exclusively breastfed for 6 months or longer. Moreover, the mothers of such infants have more prolonged lactational amenorrhea and faster postpartum weight loss. Based on the results of this review, the World Health Assembly adopted a resolution to recommend exclusive breastfeeding for 6 months to its member countries. Large randomized trials are recommended in both developed and developing countries to ensure that exclusive breastfeeding for 6 months does not increase the risk of undernutrition (growth faltering), to confirm the health benefits reported thus far, and to investigate other potential effects on health and development, especially over the long term.

Subjects were 30 women with BPD and 22 normal controls, assessed using the Diagnostic Interview for Borderlines, revised, the Hamilton Depression Scale (HAM-A) and the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM-A), the Diagnostic Assessment of Personality Pathology, the Buss-Durkee Guilt-Hostility Inventory, the Barratt Impulsivity Scale (BIS), and challenge tests to measure serotonergic, cholinergic and noradrenergic activity. Borderline subjects with high HAM-A and HAM-D scores showed a faster time to peak in prolactin response to meta-chlorphenylpiperazine (m-CPP) challenge. Borderline subjects with high BIS scores showed prolactin blunting. There were no differences in cortisol response to m-CPP, or on the cholinergic and noradrenergic challenges. The results suggest that impulsive traits in borderline patients are associated with abnormalities in serotonergic systems. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

The mechanism is posttranscriptional and involves two cytoplasmic iron regulatory proteins, IRP1 and IRP2. Under conditions of iron starvation, IRPs stabilize the transferrin receptor and inhibit the translation of ferritin mRNAs by binding to "iron responsive elements" (IREs) within their untranslated regions. The IRE/IRP system also controls the expression of additional IRE-containing mRNAs, encoding proteins of iron and energy metabolism. The activities of IRP1 and IRP2 are regulated by distinct posttranslational mechanisms in response to cellular iron levels. Thus, in iron-replete cells, IRP1 assembles a cubane iron-sulfur cluster, which prevents IRE binding, while IRP2 undergoes proteasomal degradation. IRP1 and IRP2 also respond, albeit differentially, to iron-independent signals, such as hydrogen peroxide, hypoxia, or nitric oxide. Basic principles of the IRE/IRP system and recent advances in understanding the regulation and the function of IRP1 and IRP2 are discussed.

Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) is a 32-kDa stress protein that degrades heme to biliverdin, free iron, and carbon monoxide. In this; chapter, we review evidence that (1) HO-1 is overexpressed in CNS tissues affected by Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), multiple sclerosis (MS), and other degenerative and nondegenerative CNS diseases; (2) the pro-oxidant effects of dopamine, hydrogen peroxide, beta-amyloid, and proinflammatory cytokines stimulate HO-1 expression in some of these conditions; and (3) upregulation of HO-1 in astrocytes exacerbates intracellular oxidative stress and promotes sequestration of nontransferrin-derived iron by the mitochondrial compartment. A model is presented implicating glial HO-1 induction as a "final common pathway" leading to pathological iron sequestration and mitochondrial insufficiency in a host of human CNS disorders.

Organisms are equipped with specific proteins designed for iron acquisition, export and transport, and storage, as well as with sophisticated mechanisms that maintain the intracellular labile iron pool at an appropriate level. Despite these homeostatic mechanisms, organisms often face the threat of either iron deficiency or iron overload. This review describes several hereditary iron-overloading conditions that are confined to the brain. Recently, a mutation in the L-subunit of ferritin has been described that causes the formation of aberrant L-ferritin with an altered C-terminus. Individuals with this mutation in one allele of L-ferritin have abnormal aggregates of ferritin and iron in the brain, primarily in the globus pallidus. Patients with this dominantly inherited late-onset disease present with symptoms of extrapyramidal dysfunction. Mice with a targeted disruption of a gene for iron regulatory protein 2 (IRP2), a translational repressor of ferritin, misregulate iron metabolism in the intestinal mucosa and the central nervous system. Significant amounts of ferritin and iron accumulate in white matter tracts and nuclei, and adult IRP2-deficient mice develop a movement disorder consisting of ataxia, bradykinesia, and tremor. Mutations in the frataxin gene are responsible for Friedreich's ataxia, the most common of the inherited ataxias. Frataxin appears to regulate mitochondrial iron-sulfur cluster formation, and the neurologic and cardiac manifestations of Friedreich's ataxia are due to iron-mediated mitochondrial toxicity. Patients with Hallervorden-Spatz syndrome, an autosomal recessive, progressive neurodegenerative disorder, have mutations in a novel pantothenate kinase gene (PANK2). The cardinal feature of this extrapyramidal disease is pathologic iron accumulation in the globus pallidus. The defect in PANK2 is predicted to cause the accumulation of cysteine, which binds iron and causes oxidative stress in the iron-rich globus pallidus. Finally, aceruloplasminemia is an autosomal recessive disorder of iron metabolism caused by loss-of-function mutations in ceruloplasmin gene that leads to misregulation of both systemic and central nervous system iron trafficking. Affected individuals suffer from extrapyramidal signs, cerebellar ataxia, progressive neurodegeneration of retina, and diabetes mellitus. Excessive iron depositions are found in the brain, liver, pancreas, and other parenchymal cells, but plasma iron concentrations are decreased. These conditions are not common, but awareness about them is important for differential diagnosis of various neurodegenerative disorders.

Redox Neurology may be defined as the study of the roles of free radicals, transition metals, oxidative stress, and antioxidant defenses in diseases of the nervous system. In this position paper, an argument is presented for recognition of this field as an emerging subspecialty within medical neurology. A program for postresidency fellowship training in Redox Neurology that integrates laboratory experience with specialized clinical practice is proposed. Opportunities for research and teaching careers in the redox neurosciences are outlined. The paper concludes with a forecast of several research themes likely to preoccupy this nascent discipline in the days ahead.

The widespread availability, relatively low cost and informativeness of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has made it the most popular of the techniques available to help with this task. Here, on the basis of functional imaging studies of stroke, diffuse microvascular disease and multiple sclerosis, we argue that processes of motor control and learning in the healthy brain share common mechanisms with those for adaptive functional reorganisation during spontaneous recovery after brain injury or with neurorehabilitation. Relatively stringent criteria can be met to confirm that adaptive functional reorganisation limits disability even in the adult brain: functional brain changes are related to disease burden, can be found in patients with demonstrable pathology but no clinical deficits and can be defined (in motor cortex) even in the absence of volitional recruitment. Initial studies of neurorehabilitation responses using fMRI and transcranial magnetic stimulation demonstrate that adaptive reorganisation can be manipulated directly with both pharmacological and behavioural interventions. The combination of strategies based on a strong biological rational with monitoring their effects using highly informative functional brain imaging methods heralds a new era of scientifically-founded neurorehabilitation.

The French experience and review of the literature.	REVUE NEUROLOGIQUE			French	Article							MOTOR-NEURON DISEASE; TRANSGENIC MICE; SOD1 MUTATIONS; ALS; MUTANT; D90A; IDENTIFICATION; POLYMORPHISM; SURVIVAL; MODEL	About 20 p. cent of cases of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis are familial (FALS). Fifteen percent of FALS cases are associated with an abnormality in the superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) gene. To date, more than 100 different genetic abnormalities have been reported, all except two are autosomal dominant. The clinical characteristics of patients presenting with FALS associated with an SOD 1 abnormality is homogeneous when there is no doubt about the hereditary aspect of the genetic abnormality: mean age at onset 42 years, limb onset slow evolution. Except when present in the setting of a clearly inherited disease (FALS) (several patients through several generations), the causality of a given SOD1 mutation often remains an open question. Consequently, search for SOD1 mutation is not warranted when atypical features such as young age at onset or slow progression are present Conversely, a complete family study is justified to determine the precise role of a given SOD1 mutation because of the large number of potential SOD1 mutations, the variability of the transmission mode, and the non-exceptional absence of proven causality for ALS.

The 20 selected studies included 652 participants (321 patients with schizophrenia and 331 healthy subjects). Effect sizes were evaluated using d values for the following sleep variables: sleep latency (SL), total sleep time (TST), sleep efficiency index (SEI), total awake time (TAT), stage 2 percentage (S2%), stage 4 percentage, slow-wave-sleep percentage, rapid-eye-movement (REM) percentage, and REM latency. The initial meta-analysis revealed that patients with schizophrenia have the following sleep disorders: increased SL, decreased TST, and decreased SEI. A moderator analysis revealed that these sleep disorders were worse for the neuroleptic-withdrawal group relative to the never-treated group. However, only never-treated patients showed significantly increased TAT and diminished S2%. These results confirm that patients with schizophrenia have sleep disorders that are not necessarily a consequence of neuroleptic treatments, suggesting that sleep disorders are an intrinsic feature of schizophrenia. However, it must be noted that some sleep disorders may be amplified by residual effects of neuroleptic withdrawal, while others appear to be dampened by neuroleptic treatment.

J	Campbell, SA; Edwards, R; Van den Driessche, P				Campbell, SA; Edwards, R; Van den Driessche, P			Delayed coupling between two neural network loops	SIAM JOURNAL ON APPLIED MATHEMATICS			English	Article						neural network; coupled loops; time delay; bifurcation; oscillation	STABILITY; NEURONS; SYNCHRONIZATION; SYSTEMS; MODELS; MEMORY	Coupled loops with time delays are common in physiological systems such as neural networks. We study a Hopfield-type network that consists of a pair of one-way loops each with three neurons and two-way coupling ( of either excitatory or inhibitory type) between a single neuron of each loop. Time delays are introduced in the connections between loops, and the effects of coupling strengths and delays on the network dynamics are investigated. These effects depend strongly on whether the coupling is symmetric ( of the same type in both directions) or asymmetric ( inhibitory in one direction and excitatory in the other). The network of six delay differential equations is studied by linear stability analysis and bifurcation theory. Loops having inherently stable zero solutions cannot be destabilized by weak coupling, regardless of the delay. Asymmetric coupling is weakly stabilizing but easily upset by delays. Symmetric coupling ( if not too weak) can destabilize an inherently stable zero solution, leading to nontrivial fixed points if the gain of the neuron response function is not too negative or to oscillation otherwise. In the oscillation case, intermediate delays can restabilize the zero solution. At the borderline of the weak coupling region ( symmetric or asymmetric), stability can change with delay ranges. When the coupling strengths are of the same magnitude, the oscillations of corresponding neurons in the two loops can be in phase, antiphase ( symmetric coupling), or one quarter period out of phase ( asymmetric coupling) depending on the delay.

It is hard to achieve high recognition results using a single set of features and a single classifier, since handwritten numerals contain many pattern variations which mostly depend upon individual writing styles. In this paper, we propose a recognition system using hybrid features and a combined classifier. To improve recognition rate, we select mutually beneficial features such as directional features, crossing point features and mesh features, and create three new hybrid feature sets from them. These feature sets hold the local and global characteristics of input numeral images. We also implement a combined classifier from three neural network classifiers to achieve a high recognition rate, using fuzzy integral for multiple network fusion. In order to verify the performance of the proposed recognition system, experiments with the unconstrained handwritten numeral database of Concordia University, Canada were performed, producing a recognition rate of 97.85%.

In an in-building environment, the multipath caused by reflection and diffraction, and the obstruction and/or the blockage of the shortest path between transmitter and receiver are the main sources of range measurement errors. Due to the harsh indoor environment, unreliable measurements of location metrics such as RSS, AOA and TOA/TDOA result in the deterioration of the positioning performance. Hence, alternatives to the traditional parametric geolocation techniques have to be considered. In this paper, we present a method for mobile station location using narrowband channel measurement results applied to an artificial neural network (ANN). The proposed system learns off-line the location 'signatures' from the extracted location-dependent features of the measured data for LOS and NLOS situations. It then matches online the observation received from a mobile station against the learned set of 'signatures' to accurately locate its position. The location precision of the proposed system, applied in an in-building environment, has been found to be 0.5 meter for 90% of trained data and about 5 meters for 45% of untrained data.

The objective of this study is to develop a neuro-fuzzy technology for the recognition of machining states in CAD/CAM, in particular, the collision states between different profiles, and the treatment after a collision detection. This work is divided in two parts; the first is to design a multiple layers neural-network, which after training evaluates the quality of a machining state at a point of the profile, and therefore the probability of existence of a collision between two profiles. The second part is a design of a fuzzy system that intervenes after the passage of the first tool. If there was a bad quality of machining, the system decides to pass one or several other tools, in order to find the necessary tools for this phase and the corresponding zones, while preventing collisions.

We used Random-Gabor Kinematograms (RGKs) formed with luminance-modulated (first-order) or contrast-modulated (second-order) concentric Gabor patterns with a sinusoidal spatial frequency of 3c deg(-1). To achieve equal visibility, modulation depth was set at 30% for first-order Gabors and at 100% for second-order Gabors. Subjects were 24 adults and 24 5-year-olds. For both first- and second-order global motion, the motion coherence threshold of 5-year-olds was less mature for the slowest speed (1.5degrees s(-1)) than for the two faster speeds (6 and 9degrees s(-1)). In addition, at the slowest speed, the immaturity was greater for second-order than for first-order global motion. The findings suggest that the extrastriate mechanisms underlying the perception of global motion are different, at least in part, for first- versus second-order signals and for slower versus faster speeds. They also suggest that those separate mechanisms mature at different rates during middle childhood. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Not surprisingly, an upbringing that is associated with adversity can produce detrimental effects on health. A central theme that arises from studies in human and nonhuman species is that the effects of adversity are mediated by the interactions between a mother and her young. In this review we describe some of the long-term effects of maternal care on the offspring and we focus on the impact of naturally occurring variations in the behavior of female rats. Of particular interest are mothers that engage in high or low amounts of licking/grooming (LG) and arched-back nursing (ABN) of their pups, but do so within the normal range for this species. Such variations in LG-ABN can alter the function of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, and cognitive and emotional development by directly affecting the underlying neural mechanisms. At the heart of these mechanisms is gene expression. By studying the hippocampal glucocorticoid receptor gene, we have identified that maternal care regulates its expression by changing two processes: the acetylation of histones H3-K9, and the methylation of the NGFI-A consensus sequence on the exon 1(7) promoter. Sustained "maternal effects" appear elsewhere in biology, including plants, insects, and lizards, and may have evolved to program advantages in the environments that the offspring will likely face as adults. Given the importance of early life and parent-child interactions to later behavior, prevention and intervention programs should target this critical phase of development.

These structures included the inferior olive (IO), the source of climbing fibers, and the lateral reticular nucleus (LRt) and basilar pontine nuclei (PN), sources of mossy fibers. We examined two immediate early gene products with two different time courses of expression: Fos, which persists only for a few (6-8) h after activation and FRA expression, which lasts for longer periods of time, i.e. hours and/or days after activation. Gravity effects on Fos and FRA gene expression were evident in vestibular and visual areas of the IO, including the dorsomedial cell column, the beta subnucleus and the dorsal cap of Kooy of the medial nucleus (which projects to the flocculonodular lobe, i.e. to the vestibular area of the IO involved in the olivary control of the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR)). Gene expression also affected the subnuclei A, B, and C and the caudal part of the medial IO. These olivary regions do not receive vestibular afferents, but rather spinal afferents, and are particularly involved in the olivary control of the vestibulospinal reflex (VSR). Changes in Fos expression were also observed in the LRt and the PN. We suggest that sensory substitution, in which signals produced by a subject's own activity replace activity normally provided by macular stimulation, contributes to the recovery of microgravity-related postural and motor deficits. While no consistent increases in FRA expression occurred in vestibular IO regions 24 It after launch, consistent increases in FRA expression occurred 24 h after landing. We hypothesize that this asymmetrical pattern of gene expression resulted from (i) tonic microgravity experienced after launch counteracting the effects of increased phasic gravitational forces experienced during launch, and (ii) the tonic gravitational field experienced after landing potentiating the effects of increased phasic gravitational forces experienced during landing. The specificity of these results is demonstrated by an absence of direct gravity-related changes in Fos expression in other precerebellar structures such as the external cuneate nucleus, group X, and the dorsal column nuclei that transmit exteroceptive and proprioceptive signals P. to thalamic nuclei and somatosensory areas of the cerebral cortex. The gravity-related Fos and FRA expression! changes in the IO and the LRt seen here are of interest in view of the important role their projections play in adaptive gain changes of the VOR and VSR during sustained visuo-vestibular and neck-vestibular stimulation.

Cells were identified as microglia immunohistochemically with NN-2, a monoclonal antibody (MAb) raised against teleost retinal microglial cells, and by their phagocytic abilities. Morphological characterization of the cells identified round, phase-bright cells as well as flattened macrophage-like cells. Ramified cells were also seen but they were rare. Fusion of macrophage-like cells occurred in high density cultures and resulted in the formation of giant cells that disintegrated a few days later. Immunohistochemical studies demonstrated that virtually all of the cells in our cultures were NN-2+ and did not label with either antiGFAP (an astrocyte marker) or MAb 6132 (an oligodendrocyte marker). Cells identified as microglia were intensely phagocytic and ingested latex microspheres, DiIAcLDL and goldfish myelin in vitro. In addition, we labelled microglial cells in vivo with intracranial injections of fluorescent dextran and found that microglia isolated from these animals contained the dextran and phagocytosed microspheres. We also studied the effect of myelin on microsphere uptake and compared the effect of myelin and opsonized myelin on the phagocytic activity of the cells. Our results showed a clear increase in the phagocytic activity of microglia when incubated with myelin, with an enhanced effect of opsonized myelin. (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Targeted inactivation of TB-RBP leads to abnormalities in fertility and behavior. A testis-enriched kinesin KIF17b coimmunoprecipitates with TB-RBP in a RNA-protein complex containing specific cAMP-responsive element modulator (CREM)regulated mRNAs. The specificity of this interaction is confirmed by in vivo RNA-protein crosslinking and transfections of hippocampal neurons. Combining in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry at the electron microscope level, a temporally sequential dissociation of KIF17b and TB-RBP from specific mRNAs is detected with TB-RBP release coincident with the time of mRNA translation, indicating a separation of the processes of transport and translation. We conclude that KIF17b serves as a molecular motor component of a TB-RBP-mouse ribonucleoprotein complex transporting a group of specific CREM-regulated mRNAs in mammalian male postmeiotic germ cells. Because KIF17b has been reported to control CREM-dependent transcription in male germ cells by regulating the intracellular location of the transcriptional coactivator activator of CREM in testis, this indicates that one kinesin links the processes of transcription and transport of specific mRNAs in mammalian male germ cells.

We propose a methodology to generate MRI and SPECT datasets dedicated to the evaluation of MRI/SPECT fusion methods and illustrate the method when dealing with ictal SPECT. The method consists in generating normal or pathological SPECT data perfectly aligned with a high-resolution 3D T1-weighted MRI using realistic Monte Carlo simulations that closely reproduce the response of a SPECT imaging system. Anatomical input data for the SPECT simulations are obtained from this 3D T1-weighted MRI, while functional input data result from an inter-individual analysis of anatomically standardized SPECT data. The method makes it possible to control the 'brain perfusion' function by proposing a theoretical model of brain perfusion from measurements performed on real SPECT images. Our method provides an absolute gold standard for assessing MRI/SPECT registration method accuracy since, by construction, the SPECT data are perfectly registered with the MRI data. The proposed methodology has been applied to create a theoretical model of normal brain perfusion and ictal brain perfusion characteristic of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. To approach realistic and unbiased perfusion models, real SPECT data were corrected for uniform attenuation, scatter and partial volume effect. An anatomic standardization was used to account for anatomic variability between subjects. Realistic simulations of normal and ictal SPECT deduced from these perfusion models are presented. The comparison of real and simulated SPECT images showed relative differences in regional activity concentration of less than 20% in most anatomical structures, for both normal and ictal data, suggesting realistic models of perfusion distributions for evaluation purposes. Inter-hemi spheric asymmetry coefficients measured on simulated data were found within the range of asymmetry coefficients measured on corresponding real data. The features of the proposed approach are compared with those of other methods previously described to obtain datasets appropriate for the assessment of fusion methods.

Our study demonstrates a clear involvement of both glutamatergic and, to a lesser extent, GABAergic neurons in an early onset transgenic mouse model of AD-like amyloid pathology. Immunohistochemical staining and subsequent quantification has revealed a statistically significant increased density of glutamatergic and GABAergic presynaptic boutons in both the plaque free and plaque adjacent cortical neuropile areas of transgenic mice as compared to non-transgenic controls. Furthermore, amyloid plaque size was shown to have a statistically significant effect on the relative area occupied by dystrophic glutamatergic neurites in the peri-plaque neuropile. These findings support our hypothesis that the amyloid pathology progresses in a time and neurotransmitter specific manner, first in the cholinergic system which appears to be most vulnerable, followed by the glutamatergic presynaptic boutons and finally the somewhat more resilient GABAergic terminals.

2ND-ORDER QCD CORRECTIONS; BRANCHING FRACTIONS; PROMPT LEPTONS; Z(0) PEAK; Z-BOSON; Z POLE; LEP; FRAGMENTATION; MESONS	A measurement of the forward-backward asymmetries of e(+)e(-) --> b (b) over bar and e(+)e(-) --> c (c) over bar events using electrons and muons produced in semileptonic decays of bottom and charm hadrons is presented. The outputs of two neural networks designed to identify b --> l(-) and c --> l(+) decays are used in a maximum likelihood fit to a sample of events containing one or two identified leptons. The b and c quark forward-backward asymmetries at three centre-of-mass energies roots and the average B mixing parameter <(chi)over bar> are determined simultaneously in the fit. Using all data collected by OPAL near the Z resonance, the asymmetries are measured to be: A(FB)(b (b) over bar) = (4.7 +/- 1.8 +/- 0.1)%, A(FB)(c (c) over bar) = (-6.8 +/- 2.5 +/- 0.9)% at <roots> = 89.51 GeV, A(FB)(b (b) over bar) = (9.72 +/- 0.42 +/- 0.15)%, A(FB)(c (c) over bar) = (5.68 +/- 0.54 +/- 0.39)% at <roots> = 91.25 GeV, A(FB)(b (b) over bar) = (10.3 +/- 1.5 +/- 0.2)%, A(FB)(c (c) over bar) = (14.6 +/- 2.0 +/- 0.8)% at <roots> = 92.95 GeV, For the average B mixing parameter, a value of: (chi) over bar = (13.12 +/- 0.49 +/- 0.42)% is obtained. In each case the first uncertainty is statistical and the second systematic. These results are combined with other OPAL measurements of the b and c forward-backward asymmetries, and used to derive a value for the effective electroweak mixing angle for leptons sin(2)theta(eff)(l) of 0.23238 +/- 0.00052.

J	Courtemanche, R; Fujii, N; Graybiel, AM				Courtemanche, R; Fujii, N; Graybiel, AM			Synchronous, focally modulated beta-band oscillations characterize local field potential activity in the striatum of awake behaving monkeys	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						basal ganglia; synchrony; oculomotor; oscillation; ensemble recordings; network activity	1-METHYL-4-PHENYL-1,2,3,6-TETRAHYDROPYRIDINE PRIMATE MODEL; BASAL GANGLIA; SENSORIMOTOR CORTEX; MOTOR CORTEX; SUBTHALAMIC NUCLEUS; ACTIVITY PATTERNS; PALLIDAL NEURONS; PARKINSONIAN PRIMATES; MICROEXCITABLE ZONES; CEREBRAL-CORTEX	Synchronous oscillatory activity has been observed in a range of neural networks from invertebrate nervous systems to the human frontal cortex. In humans and other primates, sensorimotor regions of the neocortex exhibit synchronous oscillations in the beta-frequency band (similar to15 - 30 Hz), and these are also prominent in the cerebellum, a brainstem sensorimotor region. However, recordings in the basal ganglia have suggested that such beta-band oscillations are not normally a primary feature of these structures. Instead, they become a dominant feature of neural activity in the basal ganglia in Parkinson's disease and in parkinsonian states induced by dopamine depletion in experimental animals. Here we demonstrate that when multiple electrodes are used to record local field potentials, 10 - 25 Hz oscillations can be readily detected in the striatum of normal macaque monkeys. These normally occurring oscillations are highly synchronous across large regions of the striatum. Furthermore, they are subject to dynamic modulation when monkeys perform a simple motor task to earn rewards. In the striatal region representing oculomotor activity, we found that small focal zones could pop in and out of synchrony as the monkeys made saccadic eye movements, suggesting that the broadly synchronous oscillatory activity interfaces with modular spatiotemporal patterns of task-related activity. We suggest that the background beta-band oscillations in the striatum could help to focus action - selection network functions of cortico-basal ganglia circuits.

Our aim was to investigate whether there is a common genetic etiology between restless legs syndrome and spinocerebellar ataxia type 3. Design: Systematic differences in the number of spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 trinucleotide repeat were investigated by means of an association study. The relationship between the size of the expanded alleles and several clinical features was also considered. Participants and Setting: 125 extensively characterized restless legs syndrome patients compared with 188 healthy controls matched for ethnic background. Interventions: N/A. Measurements and Results: No CAG repeat expansions in the pathologic or intermediate range were detected in any of the examined subjects, including patients and controls. A similar allelic distribution was observed in both groups (Mann-Whitney U test = 78406; P = 0.99). Moreover, stratification analyses of the patients' samples according to different clinical and polysomnographic variables disclosed no significant differences. Conclusions: These results do not provide evidence toward an involvement of large CAG trinucleotide expansions at the spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 locus in idiopathic restless legs syndrome.

Four different isoforms diverging in their carboxyl terminus were isolated, corresponding to proteins encompassing 560, 610, 626, and 745 amino acids. Sequences included a signal peptide of 32 amino acids, followed by a cytokine binding domain containing four conserved cysteines, a WSDWS motif, and a region consisting of three fibronectin type III domain repeats. No immunoglobulin-like module was identified in the GPL sequences. The intracellular part of longer isoforms contained a proline-rich region defining a box1 motif for interaction with the Janus kinases. The Gpl gene is organized in 15 exons and is located on 5q11.2 in tandem with the gp130 gene. Both genes were only separated by 24 kilobases, with opposite transcriptional orientations. The GPL receptor displayed a 28% identity with gp130. Specific GPL transcripts were observed in tissues involved in reproduction. Transcripts were also found in blood cells and in bone marrow, revealing expression of GPL in all of the myelomonocytic lineage, from hematopoietic stem cells to activated dendritic cells. In monocytes and dendritic cells, expression of GPL was strongly up-regulated by interferon-gamma, indicating a possible involvement of GPL in Th1-type immune responses. The molecular basis of cell signaling mediated by GPL was studied using chimeric receptors where external portions of alpha or beta interleukin-5 receptor subunits were fused to the internal portion of GPL or of related receptors. Results indicated that association of GPL to the intracellular portions of gp130, or LIF receptor, allowed the signaling cascade.

The signaling cascades activated by p75NTR that result in apoptosis remain poorly understood. In this study, we show that overexpression of p75NTR in primary cortical neurons, in pheochromocytoma cell line (PC12) cells, and in glioma cells results in activation of Jun kinase (JNK), accumulation of cytochrome c within the cytosol, and activation of caspases 9, 6, and 3. To link p75NTR-dependent JNK activation to mitochondrial cytochrome c release, regulation of BH3-domain-only family members was examined. Transcription of BH3-domain-only family members was not induced by p75NTR, but p75NTR-dependent JNK activation resulted in phosphorylation and oligomerization of the BH3-domain-only family member Bad. Loss of function experiments using Bad dominant negatives or RNA interference demonstrated a requirement for Bad in p75NTR-induced apoptosis. Together, these studies provide the first data linking apoptosis induced by p75NTR to the phosphorylation of BH3-domain- only family members.

Here, we identify SHP-1 as a phosphotyrosine phosphatase that negatively regulates TrkA. SHP-1 formed complexes with TrkA at Y490, and dephosphorylated it at Y674/675. Expression of SHP-1 in sympathetic neurons induced apoptosis and TrkA dephosphorylation. Conversely, inhibition of endogenous SHP-1 with a dominant-inhibitory mutant stimulated basal tyrosine phosphorylation of TrkA, thereby promoting NGF-independent survival and causing sustained and elevated TrkA activation in the presence of NGF. Mice lacking SHP-1 had increased numbers of sympathetic neurons during the period of naturally occurring neuronal cell death, and when cultured, these neurons survived better than wildtype neurons in the absence of NGF. These data indicate that SHP-1 can function as a TrkA phosphatase, controlling both the basal and NGF-regulated level of TrkA activity in neurons, and suggest that SHP-1 regulates neuron number during the developmental cell death period by directly regulating TrkA activity.

We screened a human lung cDNA expression library for potential CaMKI substrates by solid phase in situ phosphorylation ("phosphorylation screening"). Multiple overlapping partial length cDNAs encoding three proteins were detected. Two of these proteins are known: 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose 2,6-bisphosphatase and eukaryotic translation initiation factor (eIF) 4GII. To determine whether CaMKI substrates identified by phosphorylation screening represent authentic physiological targets, we examined the potential for [Ca2+](i)- and CaMKI-dependent phosphorylation of eIF4GII in vitro and in vivo. Endogenous eIF4GII immunoprecipitated from HEK293T cells was phosphorylated by CaMKI, in vitro as was a recombinant fragment of eIF4GII encompassing the central and C-terminal regions. The latter phosphorylation occurred with favorable kinetics (K-m = 1 muM; k(cat) = 1.8 s(-1)) at a single site, Ser(1156), located in a segment of eIF4GII aligning with the phosphoregion of eIF4GI. Phosphopeptide mapping and back phosphorylation experiments revealed [Ca2+](i)- dependent, CaMKI site-specific, eIF4GII phosphorylation in vivo. This phosphorylation was blocked by kinase-negative CaMKI consistent with a requirement for endogenous CaMKI for in vivo eIF4GII phosphorylation. We conclude that phosphorylation screening is an effective method for searching for intracellular targets of CaMKI and may have identified a new role of Ca2+ signaling to the translation apparatus.

J	Hussein, SM; Duff, EK; Sirard, C				Hussein, SM; Duff, EK; Sirard, C			Smad4 and beta-catenin co-activators functionally interact with lymphoid-enhancing factor to regulate graded expression of Msx2	JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							GROWTH-FACTOR-BETA; EMBRYONIC STEM-CELLS; NEURAL CREST MIGRATION; GENE-EXPRESSION; TRANSCRIPTIONAL ACTIVATION; CHICK-EMBRYO; DNA-BINDING; WNT; XENOPUS; INDUCTION	Recent in vivo evidence suggests that Wnt signaling plays a central role in determining the fate of stem cells in the ectoderm and in the neural crest by modulating bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) levels, which, in turn, influence Msx gene expression. However, the molecular mechanism regulating the expression of the Msx genes as key regulators of cell fate has not been elucidated. Here we show in murine embryonic stem cells that BMP-dependent activation of Msx2 is mediated via the cooperative binding of Smad4 at two Smad binding elements and of lymphoid enhancing factor (Lef1) at two Lef1/TCF binding sites. Lef1 can synergize with Smad4 and Smad1 to activate Msx2 promoter, and this transcriptional complex is assembled on the endogenous promoter in response to BMP2. The Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway can activate Msx2 via the binding of Lef1 to its promoter and synergizes with BMP2 to activate Msx2 expression, possibly via enhanced recruitment of the p300/cAMP-response element-binding protein-binding protein co-factor. Interestingly, the Wnt/beta-catenin- dependent activation of Msx2 was defective in Smad4-deficient embryonic stem cells or when Smad binding elements were mutated but persisted in the presence of various BMP antagonists, indicating that Smad4 was involved in transducing the Wnt/beta-catenin signals in the absence of a BMP autocrine loop. A chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that endogenous Smad4, but not Smad1, was part of the Lef1 transcriptional complex in response to beta-catenin activation, dismissing any implication of BMP signaling in this response. We propose that Wnt signaling pathway could dictate cell fate not only by modulating BMP levels but also by directly regulating cooperatively BMP-target genes.

Mutations in the gene KRIT1 are responsible for type 1 CCM (CCM1). We report that a novel gene, MGC4607, exhibits eight different mutations in nine families with type 2 CCM (CCM2). MGC4607, similar to the KRIT1 binding partner ICAP1alpha, encodes a protein with a phosphotyrosine-binding domain. This protein may be part of the complex pathway of integrin signaling that, when perturbed, causes abnormal vascular morphogenesis in the brain, leading to CCM formation.

DESIGN: Prospective, nonrandomized clinical trial. METHODS: Twenty uncontrolled OAG patients, 20 uncontrolled OHT patients, and 20 normal volunteers were prospectively enrolled. Mean ONH and peripapillary retinal blood flow measurements were performed by SLDF version 3.3 using five Heidelberg Retina Flowmeter (Heidelberg Engineering, Heidelberg, Germany) im. ages. Statistical evaluations were performed on the three study groups using one,way analysis of variance. Flow values of the neuroretinal rim of the ONH, nasal peripapillary retina, and temporal peripapillary retina were then correlated with the clinical parameters of age, cup/disk (C/D) ratio, intraocular pressure (IOP), visual field mean defect, maximum,recorded IOP, and ocular perfusion pressure. RESULTS: Neuroretinal rim blood flow in the OAG group was 158 +/- 79 arbitrary units (au), whereas in the OHT group it was 277 +/- 158 au, and in the NOR group it was 272 +/- 93 au. Differences were statistically significant between the OAG group and each of the other groups (P = .001) but not between OHT and NOR groups (P = .91). Peripapillary retinal flow values showed no statistically significant differences between groups (P = .76 nasal and 0.93 temporal). Neuroretinal rim flow values showed a significant inverse correlation with C/D ratio (P = .001). Mean neuroretinal rim blood flow was significantly higher (350 +/- 184 au) in the 10 OHT patients with C/D ratios < 0.4 when compared with the 10 OHT patients with larger C/D ratios (203 +/- 79 au) (P = .039). Conversely, peripapillary retinal blood flow showed no significant correlation with any clinical parameter. CONCLUSION: Open-angle glaucoma patients had significantly lower blood flow in the ONH compared with OHT patients and normal volunteers. No significant differences in ONH blood flow were found between ocular hypertensives and normal volunteers. For peripapillary retinal blood flow, no significant difference was seen between any groups. Neuroretinal rim blood flow was significantly inversely correlated to increased C/D ratio. Ocular hypertensives with larger C/D ratios demonstrated significantly lower rim blood flow compared with those with smaller C/D ratios, suggesting that rim perfusion might be reduced in high-risk ocular hypertensives before the manifestation of visual field defects.

Increased oxygen radicals and nitric oxide (NO) have been proposed as mechanisms. In this study, we assessed the levels of protein oxidation (carbonyl formation), lipid peroxidation (4-hydroxy-2-nonenal formation), catalase and Mn-superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD) expressions, nitric oxide synthases (NOSs), and protein tyrosine nitration in quadriceps muscles of 12 patients with patients with COPD and 6 control subjects. Lipid peroxidation was elevated in muscles of patients with patients with COPD as compared with control subjects, but protein oxidation was not. Muscle Mn-SOD but not catalase protein expression was significantly higher (200%) in patients with patients with COPDas compared with control subjects. Expression of neuronal NOS and endothelial NOS isoforms did not differ between control subjects and patients with COPD, whereas no inducible NOS protein expression was detected in limb muscles of the two groups of subjects. In patients with COPD, neuronal NOS expression correlated negatively with the degree of the airway obstruction (%FEV1 predicted). 3-Nitrotyrosine levels were significantly elevated in muscles of patients with COPDas compared with control subjects, and correlated positively with nNOS protein levels. These results indicate the development of both oxidative and nitrosative stresses in the quadriceps of patients with COPD, suggesting their involvement in muscle dysfunction.

The discovery that a familial form of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) results from mutations in the gene encoding Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1), a major anti-oxidant enzyme, stimulated considerable evaluation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and oxidative protein damage in both familial and sporadic forms of the disease. Mutations in SOD1 do not cause disease by compromising dismutating activity, but through some toxic gain of function. Although exacerbation of other copper-catalyzed enzymatic activities has been demonstrated in vitro, there is little evidence substantiating that this property is responsible for toxicity in vivo. Studies of ROS generation and oxidative damage in vivo have produced mixed results, but collectively are consistent with oxidative stress playing a secondary role in pathogenesis of the disease. Studies of post-mortem tissue from sporadic ALS patients has yielded more consistent evidence of accumulation of oxidative damage to proteins, lipids, and DNA, but the time course of accumulation cannot be determined and the initiating causes of the disease have not been identified. The interplay between motor neurons and glial cells is important in the clinical progression of both familial and sporadic motor neuron diseases and release of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species or cytokines from microglia could contribute to the demise of motor neurons. This review describes the general mechanisms of radical-mediated cellular damage followed by the evidence for and against the contribution of oxidative injury to the pathogenesis of motor neuron diseases.

By demonstrating evidence of occult upper motor neuron degeneration in vivo, a speedier and more definitive diagnosis in suspected cases could lead to earlier treatment and earlier enrollment in clinical trials. Findings compatible with ALS on routine MRI are not consistently found and are non-specific. Thus, routine anatomic imaging is useful in ruling out diseases that mimic ALS, but not in classification of new cases. Functional imaging techniques, such as PET and fMRI, have provided fascinating insights into the cortical functional reorganization that accompanies muscular weakness. PET and SPECT have revealed involvement of regions of the brain beyond the motor cortex, something not well appreciated by pathological examination. Of great need is a surrogate marker of therapeutic efficacy to make drug evaluation more efficient; neuroimaging, and magnetic resonance spectroscopy in particular, holds great promise in this regard in addition to helping us better understand the pathophysiological mechanisms of neurodegeneration.

The test statistic was the maximum of a Gaussian random field in an (N + 1)-dimensional "scale space," N dimensions for location and one dimension for the scale of a smoothing kernel. Siegmund and Worsley used two methods, one involving the expected Euler characteristic of the excursion set and the other involving the volume of tubes, to derive an approximate null distribution. The purpose of this paper is to extend the scale space result to the rotation space random field when N = 2, where the maximum is taken over all rotations of the filter as well as scales. We apply this result to the problem of searching for activation in brain images obtained by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).

However, cell death is not the only possible outcome of Fas signalling. Fas engagement by Fas Ligand can also trigger proliferation or differentiation, promote tumour progression and angiogenesis, and induce cytokine secretion and integrin expression. Recently, we have reported that Fas engagement induces a potent regenerative response in sensory neurons in vitro, and enhances peripheral nerve regeneration in vivo. In contrast, other types of neurons, notably motoneurons, are acutely sensitive to Fas-induced apoptosis. Here, we review the literature on non-apoptotic Fas signalling pathways, and discuss the potential roles, molecular mechanisms, and regulators of Fas signalling in the nervous system.

In the normal application of this method, a non-linear curve C is found that best fits the data. The method provides a projection function mapping from the data space to the curve C. However, this projection function is faulty in that points in the data space are generally not projected onto their closest neighbours on C. Here, a new projection function is introduced which ensures that the data points are projected onto their closest neighbours on C, resulting in an increase in the amount of variance explained by the NLPCA mode. This is illustrated by an analysis of the sea surface temperature anomaly data from the tropical Pacific, where the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon is manifested. A second shortcoming of the NLPCA method is that the curve C comes with a parametrization which is arbitrary and has no physical interpretation. Here, the curve is re-parametrized by arc length. This allows the computation of more meaningful time series, which we illustrate through an analysis of the Quasi-Biennial Oscillation (QBO) in the equatorial stratospheric zonal wind data.

Methods: Volumes of the amygdala were measured in 22 healthy participants and 18 neuroleptic-naive patients with first-episode schizophrenia, while controlling for intracranial area, gender, age, and handedness. Results: Persons with schizophrenia presented significantly lower amygdaloid volumes bilaterally. No significant correlations were found between the amygdaloid volumes and either the duration of the disease or the symptom severity. Conclusions: Amygdaloid volume anomalies are already present in the early phases of schizophrenia.

Dysfunction of dopamine plays a role in Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia and drug addiction. It is released in the striatum when dopamine neurons in the midbrain undergo burst firing. Several animal studies have shown that dopamine can also be released under direct control of glutamatergic corticostriatal efferents. However, the existence and physiological significance of this mode of action remain controversial. We have shown previously that repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) of the human prefrontal cortex led to focal dopamine release in the ipsilateral caudate nucleus, supporting the corticostriatal mode of dopamine release. Using the same experimental approach, we sought to confirm this hypothesis. We used [C-11]raclopride and PET to measure changes in extracellular dopamine concentration following rTMS of the motor cortex in six healthy human subjects. rTMS of the left primary motor cortex caused a reduction in [C-11]raclopride binding in the left putamen compared with rTMS of the left occipital cortex. There were no changes in binding in the right putamen, caudate nucleus or nucleus accumbens. The area of statistically significant change in binding corresponded closely to the known projection zone of corticostriatal efferents originating in monkey motor cortex. This finding has implications for the functional role of subcortical dopamine.

Studies have focused on only a few MMPs, and much remains unknown of which of the 23 MMP family members is/are critical to the multiple sclerosis disease process. Using quantitative real time polymerase chain reactions, we have systematically analysed the expression of all 23 MMP members in subsets of leukocytes isolated from the blood of normal individuals. We found a distinctive pattern of MMP expression in different cellular populations: MMP-11, MMP-26 and MMP-27 were enriched in B cells, while MMP-15, MMP-16, MMP-24 and MMP-28 were prominent in T lymphocytes. Of interest is the enrichment of a majority of MMP members in monocytes: MMP-1, MMP-3, MMP-9, MMP-10, MMP-14, MMP-19 and MMP-25. MMP-2 and MMP-17 were also significantly represented in monocytes, although B cells had significant amounts of these MMPs. In correspondence with their strong expression of many MMP members, monocytes migrated more rapidly across a model of the blood-brain barrier in culture than T or B lymphocytes. Finally, we found higher levels of two of the monocyte-expressed MMPs in multiple sclerosis patients compared with normal individuals: MMP-2 and MMP-14. Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP)-2 was also elevated in monocytes from multiple sclerosis patients, providing a mechanism for the reported activation of MMP-2 by MMP-14 and TIMP-2. These results emphasize that monocytes are prominent contributors of the neuroinflammation in multiple sclerosis through a mechanism that involves their high MMP expression and that they identify specific MMP members as targets for novel therapeutics in the disease.

The phrase "pink and black and green" was manipulated to signal a boundary after "pink" or after "black" by altering pre-boundary word durations and pause durations at the boundary in a stepwise fashion. Stimuli were presented to listeners auditorily along with a card with three alternative groupings of colored squares from which to select the presented alternative. Results revealed that normal controls were able to use both temporal cues to identify the intended grouping. In contrast, LHD patients required longer than normal pause durations to consistently identify the intended grouping, suggesting a higher than normal threshold for perception of temporal prosodic cues. Surprisingly, the RHD patients exhibited great difficulty with the task, perhaps due to the limited acoustic cues available in the stimuli. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science (USA). All rights reserved.

Inherited TC deficiency is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by megaloblastic anaemia caused by cellular vitamin B12 depletion. It may be accompanied by neurological complications, including a delay in psychomotor and mental development. This report describes three sisters with inherited TC deficiency resulting from a splicing defect in the TC gene. A point mutation was identified in intron 3 splice site of the TC gene that activates a cryptic splice site in exon 3. The transcript generated has an in-frame deletion of 81 nucleotides and the resulting truncated protein is unstable and not secreted by the cells. Until now, genetic studies have been reported in only five patients with TC deficiency and the molecular defect was different in each of them, which gives evidence for a genetic heterogeneity of the disease.

Given that the EEG records brain dysfunction, this study examines whether an abnormal EEG in first-episode psychosis patients is associated with poorer prognosis, compared with a normal EEG. Method: At their initial assessment, 61 patients with first-episode psychosis had an EEG classified according to the following modified Mayo Clinic system: normal, essentially normal (that is, one or more elements of questionable normality), or dysrhythmia (grade I to V). We assessed psychiatric symptoms using the Scale for Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS) and the Scale for Assessment of Positive Symptoms (SAPS) on entry and after 1 year of treatment. Psychosis is considered to have remitted if there are no, or minimal, psychotic symptoms (that is, a rating of 2 or less on every SAPS global rating), maintained for 1 month. Results: At the end of 1 year, 19/21 (90.5%) patients with a normal EEG had a remission of their positive symptoms, compared with 18/28 (64.3%) of those with an essentially normal EEG and only 7/12 (58.3%) of those with dysrhythmia. Negative symptoms were reduced by more than 50% in 11/18 (61.1%) patients with a normal EEG, compared with 10/28 (35.7%) patients with an essentially normal EEG. None of the 8 patients with dysrhythmia on their EEG experienced reduced negative symptoms. Conclusion: The above findings suggest that an abnormal EEG in patients with first-episode psychosis is associated with a poorer prognosis.

Here human brain imaging combined with psychophysical methods was used to assess cortical specializations for processing these two kinds of motion. A common stimulus construction was employed, controlling for differences in spatial and temporal properties, psychophysical performance and attention. Distinct cortical regions have been found preferentially processing either first- or second-order motion, both in occipital and parietal lobes, producing the first physiological evidence in humans to support evidence from psychophysical studies, brain lesion sites and computational models. These results provide evidence for the idea that first-order motion is computed in V1 and second-order motion in later occipital visual areas, and additionally suggest a functional dissociation between these two kinds of motion beyond the occipital lobe.

CLINICAL BIOMECHANICS			English	Article						step management; biomechanics; locomotor tasks; rehabilitation; healthy adults	ASCENT; KNEE; DESCENT; KINEMATICS; MOMENTS; OLDER	Objective. This study compared stair climbing and level walking in healthy adults aged over 40 years. Design. Eleven subjects performed at their comfortable speed. Background. The number of parameters studied during stair climbing has been limited, in particular in the frontal plane. Methods. Time-distance parameters and three-dimensional kinematic data were obtained using foot-switches and an Optotrak system. Ground reaction forces were collected with a force platform embedded in the second step of the staircase or in the ground for level walking. Relative angles were calculated using a Cardanic rotation matrix and the net moments and the powers at the ankle, knee and hip joints were estimated with an inverse dynamic approach. Results. A significant longer mean cycle duration and a shorter proportion of time in stance was obtained for stair climbing as compared to level walking. Profiles of the frontal plane joint angles, moments and powers indicated a different action of the hip abductors across tasks to control the pelvis in stance. Profiles of the sagittal plane confirmed the dominant role of the knee extensors during stair climbing but revealed also a knee-hip energy generation pattern that allows the avoidance of the intermediate step. Conclusions. Results suggest environment specific adaptations of the neuro-musculo-skeletal system that should be considered in the rehabilitation of stair climbing in patients. Relevance This study highlights the challenges of stair climbing compared to level walking in a within subject design. Key features of stair climbing that are important for the rehabilitation of step management are also reported. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Materials and methods: In preparation for the workshop, a survey of Canadian radiation oncologists resulted in four research areas in symptom control, including radiation-induced mucosal reactions, fatigue, radiotherapy for brain metastases and radiotherapy for bone metastases. The first half of the workshop consisted of plenary sessions where the research setting and perspective was defined for each area. This was followed by deliberations by a subgroup of researchers with special interest in the topic area. The bone-metastases subgroup deliberated the clinical context, the scientific merits and the required methodology of research questions related to the role of radiotherapy in early treatment of bone metastases, the role of re-irradiation, the role of systemic radiotherapy and patient selection for different fractionation schedules. A list of prioritised clinical studies was proposed. Results: The question of single vs multi-fraction re-irradiation for symptomatic bone metastases was identified as most pertinent to the Canadian radiation oncologists present. A multi-centre, international intergroup study is undergoing protocol development. Other study concepts, such as an alternative dose-schedule of 17 Gy/ 2 fractions/1 week for intermediate-prognosis patients, and early referral for radiation oncologist assessment of early or mildly symptomatic bone metastases for good-prognosis patients, require further methodological development before a clinical trial can be proposed. Conclusion: An NCIC-CTG workshop provided an update on current evidence-based knowledge in palliative radiotherapy for bone metastases. New trial concepts were discussed among practitioners and clinical investigators to promote dialogue and collaboration. The proposal of an international intergroup randomised trial of single vs multiple fraction re-irradiation for painful bone metastases received the most support among participants.

J	Pell, MD; Leonard, CL				Pell, Marc D.; Leonard, Carol L.			Processing emotional tone from speech in Parkinson's disease: A role for the basal ganglia	COGNITIVE AFFECTIVE & BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article								In this study, individuals with Parkinson's disease were tested as a model for basal ganglia dysfunction to infer how these structures contribute to the processing of emotional speech tone (emotional prosody). Nondemented individuals with and without Parkinson's disease (n = 21/group) completed neuropsychological tests and tasks that required them to process the meaning of emotional prosody in various ways (discrimination, identification, emotional feature rating). Individuals with basal ganglia disease exhibited abnormally reduced sensitivity to the emotional significance of prosody in a range of contexts, a deficit that could not be attributed to changes in mood, emotional-symbolic processing, or estimated frontal lobe cognitive resource limitations in most conditions. On the basis of these and broader findings in the literature, it is argued that the basal ganglia provide a critical mechanism for reinforcing the behavioral significance of prosodic patterns and other temporal representations derived from cue sequences (Lieberman, 2000), facilitating cortical elaboration of these events.

This hypersensitivity can be the result of alterations, either induced by a sensitizing agent or without a peripheral cause, in the functional properties of ion channels located in primary afferents. The tetrodotoxin-resistent sodium channel, known as Na(v)1.8, is present in nociceptive primary afferents, including those from the gut, and it has been implicated as being the main candidate for the enhanced activity that characterizes nociceptor sensitization. Other voltage-gated channels, such as calcium and potassium channels, can also contribute to the sensitization of primary afferents observed in gastrointestinal pain states.

J	Lang, A; Goulet, C; Amsel, R				Lang, A; Goulet, C; Amsel, R			Lang and Goulet Hardiness Scale: Development and testing on bereaved parents following the death of their fetus/infant	DEATH STUDIES			English	Article							CROSS-CULTURAL RESEARCH; LIFE EVENTS; INSTRUMENT DEVELOPMENT; STRESS-RESISTANCE; PERINATAL LOSS; HEALTH; PERSONALITY; NEUROTICISM; VALIDITY; BURNOUT	The process of development and testing of the Lang and Goulet Hardiness Scale (LGHS), a self-report instrument designed to measure hardiness in bereaved parents following the death of their fetus/infant, is presented. Hardiness is a personal resource, composed of 3 interdependent components that are characterized by a sense of personal control over the outcome of life events and hardships such as the death of a fetus/infant, an active orientation toward meeting the challenges brought on by the loss, and a belief in the ability to make sense of one's own existence following such a tragedy. The concept of hardiness has been studied by various disciplines and in a multitude of settings to understand its ability to lessen potentially negative effects of life stress. However, it has never been studied within the context of parental bereavement. The LGHS was developed systematically, originating from a concept analysis. A panel of 15 experts was used to establish content validity. A pretest was conducted on 73 bereaved individuals to assess convergent and discriminant validity of the LGHS. Subsequently, a validation study on 220 bereaved parents who had experienced the death of their fetus/infant 2 months previously was conducted including a retest 6 months after the loss with 192 of the remaining participants. Analyses reveal that the LGHS is a valid and reliable instrument for measuring hardiness and that it is sensitive enough to detect changes in the construct over time.

In vertebrates, gain or loss of Hox expression along the AP axis often leads to inappropriate morphogenesis, typically manifesting as homeotic transformations that affect the vertebrae and/or hindbrain. Various signalling pathways are known to impact on Hox expression, including the retinoid signalling pathway. Exogenous retinoic acid (RA), disruption of enzymes involved in maintaining normal embryonic RA distribution or mutation of the retinoid receptors (RARs and RXRs) can all impact on Hox expression with concomitant effects on AP patterning. Several Hox loci have well characterized RA response elements (RAREs), which have been shown to regulate functionally relevant Hox expression in the neurectoderm. A similar crucial function for any RARE in mesodermal Hox expression has, however, not been documented. The means by which RA regulates mesodermal Hox expression could therefore be either through an undocumented direct mechanism or through an intermediary; these mechanisms are not necessarily exclusive. In this regard, we have found that Cdx1 may serve as such an intermediary. Cdx1 encodes a homeobox transcription factor that is crucial for normal somitic expression of several Hox genes, and is regulated by retinoid signalling in vivo and in vitro likely through an atypical RARE in the proximal promoter. In order to more fully understand the relationship between retinoid signalling, Cdx1 expression and AP patterning, we have derived mice in which the RARE has been functionally inactivated. These RARE-null mutants exhibit reduced expression of Cdx1 at all stages examined, vertebral homeotic transformations and altered Hox gene expression which correlates with certain of the defects seen in Cdx1-null offspring. These findings are consistent with a pivotal role for retinoid signalling in governing a subset of expression of Cdx1 crucial for normal vertebral patterning.

In this study, we investigated whether status epilepticus caused changes in the function of voltage-gated sodium channels in entorhinal cortex layer V neurons, a cellular group important for the genesis of limbic seizures. Methods: We induced status epilepticus in rats, by using lithium-pilocarpine, and then 2-12 weeks later, used whole-cell voltage-clamp to examine voltage-activated sodium currents of acutely dissociated layer V neurons. Results: Transient sodium currents of entorhinal cortex layer V neurons isolated from 9- to 12-week post-status epilepticus rats were similar to currents in age-matched controls; however, low-threshold persistent sodium currents were significantly larger. This increase in persistent activity was not seen 2-3 weeks after pilocarpine treatment; thus it occurred after a delay comparable to the delay in the appearance of spontaneous seizures. Conclusions: Increased persistent currents are expected to accentuate neuronal excitability and thus may contribute to the genesis of spontaneous seizures after status epilepticus.

Groups of patients with cortical resections from right or left temporal, frontal, or parietal regions were required to recognize photographs of faces within a larger array, after having been shown the faces previously. Three variations of this task were used: in the first, the interval between initial presentation and recognition test was filled with an irrelevant visual task. In the second, the delay remained but the interpolated task was omitted. In the third, there was only minimal delay ("immediate recognition"). On the first two tasks, patients with right temporal-lobe lesions had marked deficits compared with all other groups, but on the third task (minimal delay) no clearcut group differences were seen, because the normal control group did worse than with delay. Normal subjects (unlike patients with right temporal-lobe excisions) apparently use the delay period to consolidate and possibly recode their visual impressions. In the context of other tasks sensitive to right temporal-lobe lesions, the findings suggest a mild impairment in the perception of complex patterns after right anterior temporal lobectomy, and a much more severe one in the retention of the perceived material.

The role of the subcortical lesion in the generation of the gelastic seizures has been established, and encouraging results have been obtained with surgical resection, destruction or disconnection of the hamartoma. The present work highlights several aspects that should be taken into account for the selection of medical and surgical treatment for individual patients. We conclude with a reflection on what we still do not understand as regards in the genesis and surgical management of the neuropsychiatric disabilities related to this disorder.

Homozygous MTL strains were constructed and shown to mate. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that opaque-phase cells are more efficient in mating than white-phase cells. The similarity of the genes involved in the mating pathway in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and C. albicans includes at least one gene (KEX2) that is involved in the processing of the alpha mating pheromone in the two yeasts. Taking into account this similarity, we searched the C. albicans genome for sequences that would encode the alpha pheromone gene. Here we report the isolation and characterization of the gene MFalpha1, which codes for the precursor of the ot mating pheromone in C. albicans. Two active alpha-peptides, 13 and 14 amino acids long, would be generated after the precursor molecule is processed in C. albicans. To examine the role of this gene in mating, we constructed an mfalpha1 null mutant of C. albicans. The mfalpha1 null mutant fails to mate as MTLalpha, while MTLa mfalpha1 cells are still mating competent. Experiments performed with the synthetic alpha-peptides show that they are capable of inducing growth arrest, as demonstrated by halo tests, and also induce shmooing in MTLa cells of C. albicans. These peptides are also able to complement the mating defect of an MTLalpha kex2 mutant strain when added exogenously, thereby confirming their roles as a mating pheromones.

Galanin and AR-M1896, a selective galanin type 2 receptor (GalR2) agonist, both significantly increased the number of action potentials in response to current pulses in 77% of the neurons, indicating an increase in excitability. Galanin also caused a rise in input resistance, decreased the holding current for -60 mV and depolarized the resting potential. In addition, Ca2+ currents elicited by voltage steps were significantly increased by both galanin and AR-M1896 in nearly 70% of the cells. This enhancement was observed in 30% of the neurons in the presence of nimodipine or omega-conotoxin, but in each case approximate to 60% less than without blocking either N- or L-type Ca2+ channels, indicating modulation of both types of Ca2+ channels. The percentage of small- and medium-sized neurons expressing GalR2 mRNA in DRGs in situ was similar to that showing increased excitability and Ca2+ current after galanin application, i.e. approximate to 70-80% of the neurons. The findings suggest that GalR2 has a role in controlling both the excitability, probably by inhibition of GIRK or leak K+ channels, and Ca2+ entry in a large population of presumably nociceptive neurons. The combination of the two effects, which possibly arise from separate biochemical pathways, would increase excitability and enhance intracellular Ca2+ signalling which would enhance sensory transmission. These mechanisms involving GalR2 receptors may underlie the pronociceptive effects of galanin described in the literature.

Some theories suggest that this process engages resources overlapping with those required for action control, but experimental support for these ideas is still required. Here, we investigated whether the human frontal eye field (FEF), an area known to control eye movements, is involved in visual awareness. Volunteers participated in a backward masking task in which they were able to detect a target in a small proportion of trials. We observed that a single pulse of transcranial magnetic stimulation applied over the FEF shortly before the target's onset facilitated visual sensitivity; subjects were able to detect an otherwise subliminal object. These results show that modulating the neuronal activity of the FEF can enhance visual detection, thereby yielding new insights into the neural basis of visual awareness.

Bath application of glutamate reduced transmitter release without affecting nerve-evoked presynaptic Ca2+ entry and handling. (1S,3R)-aminocyclopentanedicarboxylic acid (ACPD), a metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) agonist, mimicked the effects of glutamate while (S)-alpha-methyl-4-carboxyphenylglycine (MCPG), a mGluR antagonist, blocked glutamate effects. MCPG had no effect on transmitter release evoked at low frequency (0.2 Hz) but significantly reduced synaptic depression (10 Hz, 80 s). This suggests that a frequency-dependent endogenous glutamatergic modulation is present at the frog NMJ and is mediated through mGluRs. Immunohistochemical labelling revealed the presence of mGluRs at the end plate area, primarily on muscle fibers. Functional glutamate uptake machinery was also found at the NMJ as blockade of glutamate transport by the inhibitor DL-threo-beta-benzyloxyaspartate (DL-TBOA) increased high frequency-induced depression, suggesting that the transporters system is used to eliminate glutamate from the extracellular space. Moreover, immunohistochemical labelling revealed that glutamate-aspartate transporters (GLASTs) are predominantly present on perisynaptic Schwann cells (PSCs). However, local application of glutamate on PSCs unreliability evoked small Ca2+ responses. Hence, these data suggest that functional glutamatergic interactions at a purely cholinergic synapse, shape synaptic efficacy and short-term plasticity in a frequency-dependent fashion.

J	Ostry, DJ; Feldman, AG				Ostry, DJ; Feldman, AG			A critical evaluation of the force control hypothesis in motor control	EXPERIMENTAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Review						internal models; inverse dynamics; posture-movement problem; stability; predictive mechanisms	EQUILIBRIUM-POINT CONTROL; SINGLE-JOINT MOVEMENTS; ARM MOVEMENTS; ORGANIZING PRINCIPLES; REACHING MOVEMENTS; INTERNAL MODELS; VOLUNTARY MOVEMENT; PURKINJE-CELLS; INVERSE MODELS; DYNAMICS	The ability to formulate explicit mathematical models of motor systems has played a central role in recent progress in motor control research. As a result of these modeling efforts and in particular the incorporation of concepts drawn from control systems theory, ideas about motor control have changed substantially. There is growing emphasis on motor learning and particularly on predictive or anticipatory aspects of control that are related to the neural representation of dynamics. Two ideas have become increasingly prominent in mathematical modeling of motor function-forward internal models and inverse dynamics. The notion of forward internal models which has drawn from work in adaptive control arises from the recognition that the nervous system takes account of dynamics in motion planning. Inverse dynamics, a complementary way of adjusting control signals to deal with dynamics, has proved a simple means to establish the joint torques necessary to produce desired movements. In this paper, we review the force control formulation in which inverse dynamics and forward internal models play a central role. We present evidence in its favor and describe its limitations. We note that inverse dynamics and forward models are potential solutions to general problems in motor control-how the nervous system establishes a mapping between desired movements and associated control signals, and how control signals are adjusted in the context of motor learning, dynamics and loads. However, we find little empirical evidence that specifically supports the inverse dynamics or forward internal model proposals per se. We further conclude that the central idea of the force control hypothesis-that control levels operate through the central specification of forces-is flawed. This is specifically evident in the context of attempts to incorporate physiologically realistic muscle and reflex mechanisms into the force control model. In particular, the formulation offers no means to shift between postures without triggering resistance due to postural stabilizing mechanisms.

How these processes integrate to yield mature, behaviorally relevant activity patterns is largely unknown. We examined the integration of serotonergic neuromodulation and its role in the functional organization of the accessible locomotor network in developing zebrafish at behavioral and cellular levels. Locally restricted populations of serotonergic neurons and their projections appeared in the hindbrain and spinal cord of larvae after hatching (approximate today 2). However, 5-HT affected the swimming pattern only from day 4 on, when sustained spontaneous swimming appeared. 5-HT and its agonist quipazine increased motor output by reducing intervals of inactivity, observed behaviorally (by highspeed video) and in recordings from spinal neurons during fictive swimming (by whole-cell current clamp). 5-HT and quipazine had little effect on the properties of the activity periods, such as the duration of swim episodes and swim frequency. Further, neuronal input resistance, rheobasic current, and resting potential were not affected significantly. The 5-HT antagonists methy-sergide and ketanserin decreased motor output by prolonging the periods of inactivity with little effect on the active swim episode or neuronal properties. Our results suggest that 5-HT neuromodulation is integrated early in development of the locomotor network to increase its output by reducing periods of inactivity with little effect on the activity periods, which in contrast are the main targets of 5-HT neuromodulation in neonatal and adult preparations.

IL-18 acts via a receptor complex that closely resembles that of IL-1, consisting of a ligand binding protein, IL-18Ralpha, and an accessory protein, IL-18Rbeta. Here, we describe the presence of a splice variant of IL-18Rbeta that is predicted to encode a truncated soluble protein, consisting of only the first immunoglobulin-like domain of IL-18Rbeta (EMBL/ Genbank accession number AJ550893). Both forms of IL-18Rbeta were expressed in rat cortex, striatum, hypothalamus, hippocampus, and also liver, and were detected in pure cultures of microglia, astrocytes and neurons. This novel splice variant is up-regulated rapidly in microglial cells by bacterial lipopolyssacharide (LPS). We propose that this putative truncated form of IL-18Rbeta is analogous to the soluble form of IL-1R accessory protein, and could act as an important regulator of IL-18 actions.

Spinal cats	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article							NOCICEPTIVE WITHDRAWAL REFLEXES; FUNCTIONAL-ORGANIZATION; HINDLIMB; TRANSECTION; PHASE; SPINALIZATION; COORDINATION; NEURECTOMY; PLASTICITY; WALKING	The goal of these experiments was to define the contribution of hindpaw cutaneous inputs in the expression of spinal locomotion in cats. In 3 cats, some (n = 1) or all (n = 2) cutaneous nerves were cut bilaterally at ankle level before spinalization. This denervation caused small deficits that were gradually compensated as reported in the companion study. After spinalization, the completely denervated cats never recovered plantar foot placement or weight bearing of the hindquarters despite more than 35 days of treadmill training. Although normal electromyographic rhythmic activity developed at the hip and knee, ankle flexors and extensors were abnormally coactivated during stance. In contrast, the partially denervated cat regained foot placement and weight support 15 days after spinalization. However, after completing the denervation, foot placement and weight bearing were lost as in previous cats. In a 4th cat, spinalization was performed before denervation and the cutaneous nerves were cut sequentially in the right hindlimb only. Rapid locomotor adaptation occurred after cutting the deep peroneal, saphenous, and sural nerves. Later, cutting the superficial peroneal nerve produced paw drag, which was compensated within 8 days. On cutting the last cutaneous nerve (tibial), plantar foot placement was lost despite another 71 days of training. On the one hand, these experiments show that some cutaneous inputs are necessary for appropriate plantar foot placement and weight bearing of the hindquarters during spinal locomotion and, on the other hand, that locomotor compensation to partial cutaneous denervation after spinalization reveals important adaptive capacities of the spinal cord.

Eleven neuroleptic-free schizophrenic patients were compared with 11 healthy control subjects on a visuomotor procedural learning task (the Mirror Drawing Test). Average performance and learning rate did not differ between the two groups. However, schizophrenia patients were lower in learning smoothness (the consistency with which performance improves from trial to trial), which would indicate difficulty in benefiting from past experience to perform better on a current task. Because low smoothness has recently been found to be associated with striatal dysfunction, these results might indicate a premature dysfunction of the striatum in young drug-naive patients with schizophrenia. However, this dysfunction is not severe enough to prevent learning.

For instance, this has involved the analysis of motifs or the amino acid sequences of single gene products. It is unclear how the products of particular collections genes act together to provide higher order functionality in health and disease. To address this higher order problem, the function of collections of genes, as opposed to "one gene at a time" has to be studied. Accordingly, a model system is needed to test systems biology. In our studies, we used the homocysteine-folate metabolism as a model system.

In an attempt to better understand the unique pharmacological profile of [Dmt(1)] DALDA, we have prepared [H-3][Dmt(1)] DALDA and compared its binding properties with that of [H-3] DAMGO ([D-Ala(2), N-Me-Phe(4), Gly(5)-ol]-enkephalin). Kinetic studies revealed rapid association of [H-3][Dmt(1)] DALDA when incubated with mouse brain membranes (K+1 = 0.155 nM(-1) min(-1)). Dissociation of [H-3][ Dmt(1)] DALDA was also rapid (K+1 = 0.032 min(-1)) and indicated binding to a single site. [ 3H][ Dmt1] DALDA binds with very high affinity to human mu opioid receptor (hMOR) (K-d = 0.199 nM), and K-d and B-max were reduced by sodium but not Gpp(NH)p [guanosine 5'-(beta,gamma-imido) triphosphate]. Similar K-d values were obtained in brain and spinal cord tissues and SH-SY5Y cells. The hMOR: hDOR (human delta opioid receptor) selectivity of [Dmt(1)] DALDA (similar to 10,000) is 8-fold higher than DAMGO. However, [ Dmt1] DALDA is less selective than DAMGO against hKOR (human kappa opioid receptor) (26- versus 180-fold). The K-i values for a number of opioid ligands were generally higher when determined by competitive displacement binding against [H-3][Dmt(1)] DALDA compared with [H-3] DAMGO, with the exception of Dmt(1)-substituted peptide analogs. All Dmt(1) analogs showed much higher affinity for the mu receptor than corresponding Tyr(1) analogs. [S-35] GTPgammaS (guanosine 5'-O-(3[ S-35] thio) triphosphate) binding showed that [ Dmt1] DALDA and DAMGO are full agonists at hMOR and hDOR but are only partial agonists at hKOR. The very high affinity and selectivity of [H-3][Dmt(1)] DALDA for the mu receptor, together with its very low nonspecific binding (10 - 15%) and metabolic stability, make [H-3][Dmt(1)] DALDA an ideal radioligand for labeling mu receptors.

Methods: The capacity of sensory neurites in the right ventricular outflow tract associated with afferent neurons in nodose ganglia to transduce their mechanical and chemical milieu was studied in 11 anesthetized pigs before and after performing a local ventriculotomy. Results: Right ventricular outflow tract sensory neurites associated with 23 nodose ganglion afferent neurons were identified that transduced local mechanical deformation along with substance P. The capacity of these sensory neurites to transduce these stimuli was almost totally obtunded after local ventriculotomy. Conclusions: The capacity of afferent neurons to transduce the cardiac milieu can be modified by cardiac surgical interventions. This may have negative implications with respect to how the entire cardiac neuronal hierarchy transduces alterations in the cardiac milieu postsurgery. This fact should be taken into account when contemplating the placement of cardiac incisions during surgery.

It has been shown that the env gene of these viruses harbors the determinant of neurovirulence. It appears that neuronal loss occurs by an indirect mechanism, since the target motor neurons have not been found to be infected. However, the pathogenesis of the disease remains unclear. Several lymphokines, cytokines, and other cellular effectors have been found to be aberrantly expressed in the brains of infected mice, but whether these are required for the development of the neurodegenerative lesions is not known. In an effort to identify the specific effectors which are indeed required for the initiation and/or development of spongiform myeloencephalopathy, we inoculated gene-deficient (knockout [KO]) mice with ts-1 MuLV. We show here that interieukin-6 (IL-6), inducible nitric oxide synthetase (iNOS), ICE, Fas, Fas ligand (FasL), and TNF-R1 KO mice still develop signs of disease. However, transgenic mice overexpressing Bcl-2 in neurons (NSE/Bcl-2) were largely protected from hind limb paralysis and had less-severe spongiform lesions. These results indicate that motor neuron death occurs in this disease at least in part by a Bcl-2-inhibitable pathway not requiring the ICE, iNOS, Fas/FasL, TNF-R1, and IL-6 gene products.

The procedure is adaptive in that it customizes a training set, by using a 'pruning' strategy, such that the classification is robust against anatomical variability and pathology. Starting from a set of samples generated from prior tissue probability maps (a 'model') in a standard, brain-based coordinate system ('stereotaxic space'), the method first reduces the fraction of incorrectly labeled samples in this set by using a minimum spanning tree graph-theoretic approach. Then, the corrected set of samples is used by a supervised kNN classifier for classifying the entire 3D image. The classification procedure is robust against variability in the image quality through a non-parametric implementation: no assumptions are made about the tissue intensity distributions. The performance of this brain tissue classification procedure is demonstrated through quantitative and qualitative validation experiments on both simulated MRI data (10 subjects) and real MRI data (43 subjects). A significant improvement in output quality was observed on subjects who exhibit morphological deviations from the model due to aging and pathology. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In the present study, the epididymis of PPCA-/- mice from 2 to 10 months of age was compared with those of their wild-type counterparts. Major accumulations of pale vacuoles, corresponding to lysosomes, were noted in principal and narrow/apical cells in PPCA-/- mice, and clear cells also appearing highly vacuolated, were grossly enlarged in size. This was especially evident in the caput and corpus regions, where quantitative analyses confirmed that the epithelium of the tubules in these regions was expanding in profile area. In addition, the base of the epithelium in these regions was often greatly vacuolated, corresponding to cells that presented no identifiable features and appeared to be degenerating. Halo cells dispersed at various levels in the epithelium also appeared to be abnormal, accumulating pale lysosomes. Furthermore, numerous macrophages were observed in the intertubular space of the entire duct, presenting a large size and plethora of pale lysosomes. Taken together, the present data indicate major lysosomal abnormalities in the epididymis of PPCA-/- mice in a cell type and region specific manner. In addition, it is suggested that the compromised halo cells, due to PPCA deficiency within their lysosomes, cannot function properly and as a result there is a recruitment of macrophages in the intertubular space.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of acute and 7 days of administration of desipramine. a NA re-uptake inhibitor, on the rate of 5-HT synthesis in the rat brain. The study was done by an autoradiographic method using alpha-[C-14]-methyl-L-tryptophan as a tracer. The acute (10 mg/kg, i.p., 2 h before i.v. infusion of the tracer) or 7 days of desipramine (10 mg/ka per day, i.p.) did not affect plasma tryptophan (Trp) concentrations, as compared to control (saline treated) rats. Acute treatment with desipramine decreased the rate of 5-HT synthesis in the brain regions that contain 5-HT cell bodies between 19 and 28%, and increased the rate of 5-HT synthesis in the majority of areas containing 5-HT terminals between 21 and 65%. In contrast to the acute treatment, a 7-day administration increased 5-HT synthesis rates in the dorsal raphe (24%), but decreased it in raphe magnus (35%), superior olive (45%), caudate (31%). superior (38%) and inferior (53%) colliculus, and in the auditory cortex (35%). This suggests that the effect of desipramine on 5-HT synthesis rate is time-dependent and differs in the cell bodies and structures containing 5-HT nerve terminals. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The experiment compared brain responses while participants listened to classical music and scrambled versions of that same music. Specifically, the scrambled versions disrupted musical structure while holding low-level musical attributes constant, including the psychoacoustic features of the music such as pitch, loudness, and timbre. Comparing music to its scrambled counterpart, we found focal activation in the pars orbitalis region (Brodmann Area 47) of the left inferior frontal cortex, a region that has been previously closely associated with the processing of linguistic structure in spoken and signed language, and its right hemisphere homologue. We speculate that this particular region of inferior frontal cortex may be more generally responsible for processing fine-structured stimuli that evolve over time, not merely those that are linguistic.

I.c.v. injection of naloxone (10 mug) to morphine pre-treated rats (i.c.v. for 5 days) induced an immediate increase in blood pressure (similar to10 mmHg) and behavioural activity (sniffing > rearing > face washing similar to grooming similar to wet dog shake) without causing significant heart rate changes. The prior i.c.v. injection of the NK1 receptor antagonist (6.5 nmol LY306740) reduced face washing and grooming during morphine withdrawal. NK2 and NK3 receptor antagonists (6.5 nmol SR48968 and R820) did not affect behavioural effects, yet the co-injection of the three tachykinin antagonists reduced all behavioural activity. The pressor response was not affected by the selective inhibition of NK1 and NK3 receptors while both blood pressure and heart rate were markedly enhanced by SR48968 during morphine withdrawal. The potentiating effect of SR48968 was prevented following simultaneous blockade of the three tachykinin receptors. In addition to confirming the involvement of central tachykinins in behavioural manifestations to morphine withdrawal, data suggest a modulatory function for tachykinins, especially the NK2 receptor, in brain autonomic control of blood pressure and heart rate in supraspinal noloxone-precipitated withdrawal.

One refers to objects and the other deals with localization. To investigate auditory spatial and non-spatial short-term memory, we tested patients with unilateral medial temporal lobe lesions including the pole in two tasks involving either sound localization discrimination or auditory object discrimination. The results showed that both left and right temporal lobe lesions impaired spatial short-term memory whereas only lesions on the right affected non-spatial short-term memory. By contrast, the same patients were able to perform the tasks when short interstimulus intervals were used suggesting that short-term memory deficits can not be ascribed to difficulties in perception. These findings document, for the first time, in a neurological population, the functional dissociation between spatial and non-spatial auditory short-term memory that seem to depend on separate neural circuits within the medial temporal lobe.

Thiamin diphosphate is cofactor for several enzymes involved in glucose metabolism whereas thiamin triphosphate has distinct properties at the neuronal membrane. Thiamin metabolism in the brain is compartmented between neurons and neighbouring glial cells. Thiamin deficiency is commonly encountered in severe malnutrition associated with chronic alcoholism, HIV-AIDS and gastrointestinal disease where it frequently results in Wernicke's encephalopathy (the Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome). Wernicke's encephalopathy is severely underdiagnosed according to clinical criteria in both alcoholic and HIV-AIDS patients. Magnetic resonance imaging reveals bilateral ventricular enlargement, mammillary body atrophy and cerebellar degeneration indicative of selective neuronal loss that is characteristic of Wernicke's encephalopathy. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain this selective loss of neurons including a cerebral energy deficit resulting from reductions in activity of thiamin diphosphate-dependent enzymes, oxidative stress and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor-mediated excitotoxicity. Both microglia and perivascular endothelial cells are sources of NO and oxidative stress in thiamin deficiency. Decreased activities of thiamin diphosphate-dependent enzymes (in particular alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase) have also been reported in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases independent of patient malnutrition. In these cases, decreased activities result from direct toxic actions of oxidative stress and beta-amyloid produced as part of the neuronal cell death cascade in these disorders.

We investigated the effect of dietary vitamin K on retina aging (thinning). Female Sprague-Dawley rats were maintained from weaning on low (80 mug kg(-1) diet), adequate (500 mug kg(-1) diet) or high (2000 mug kg(-1) diet) levels of vitamin K1 (phylloquinone). Relative concentrations of brain vitamin K associated with these diets were 1: 3.3: 25 (K1) and 1: 2.7: 9.0 (menaquinone-4). Histomorphometry of old (21 month) rats revealed positive associations between vitamin K and thickness of retina layers, especially in the equatorial/peripheral retina. No association of diet and retina thickness was detected among young (6 month) animals. The sparing effect of vitamin K in the retina was most evident in the inner plexiform layer and in the photoreceptor inner and outer segments. Surprisingly, we observed no effect of vitamin K on the age-dependent loss of photoreceptor cells, interneurons or ganglion cells. These data suggest a role for vitamin K in maintaining the aging retina and suggest that the sparing effect of vitamin K does not reflect the survival-promoting (anti-apoptotic) activities of vitamin K-dependent proteins.

A genomic approach to the study of these drugs may elucidate their potentially novel mechanisms. We examined the heritability of sensitivity to analgesia from gabapentin and pregabalin as a precursor to linkage mapping efforts. Accordingly, I I inbred mouse strains were tested for inhibition of nociception by gabapentin or pregabalin (50-300 mg/kg, i.p.) in two different preclinical assays of inflammatory pain, the formalin test (5% formalin: 20 mul) and zymosan thermal hyperalgesia on the paw-withdrawal test (3 mg/ml zymosan; 20 RI). Significant strain-dependence of drug action was noted in each case. indicating that sensitivity to these analgesics is heritable. Furthermore, the pattern of strain sensitivities to gabapentin and pregabalin were mostly similar, supporting the notion that they act via similar genetic and physiological mechanisms. However. there was virtually no correlation between strain sensitivities to pregabalin inhibition of formalin nociception and zymosan thermal hyperalgesia. In light of previous data from our laboratory and others regarding morphine analgesia, we now establish and empirically demonstrate the general principle that pharmacogenetic mechanisms underlying analgesic sensitivity are specific to the type of pain being inhibited. This has considerable implications for ongoing pharmacogenetic investigations and, more generally, for the choices of preclinical models of pain used in drug development.

The correlation relationships among amino acids can be classified into the following four types: (1) strong positive correlation, (2) strong negative correlation, (3) weak correlation, and (4) no correlation. The correlation relationships are different for different proteins and are correlated with the features of their structural classes. The amino acids with the weak correlation relationship can be treated as the independent basis functions for the space where proteins are defined. The amino acids with large correlation coefficients are linear correlative with each other and they are not independent. The strong correlation among amino acids reflects their mutual constrained relationship, as exhibited by their relevant structural features. The information obtained through the correlation analysis is used for predicting protein structural classes and a better prediction quality is obtained than that by the simple geometry distance methods without taking into account the correlation effects.

Beta radiation prevents recanalization after coil embolization in experimental models. We wanted to assess the feasibility of using radioactive coil embolization to improve long- term results of endovascular treatment. Methods - Platinum coils were ion- implanted with 0.13 to 0.26 muCi/ cm of P-32. Forty- one patients aged 34 to 84 years with 44 aneurysms with a high propensity for recurrences were included. Radioactive coils were introduced into aneurysms to reach a target volumetric activity of 0.018 muCi/mm(3). Nonradioactive coils were also used to ensure the same safety and the same angiographic results as the standard procedure. Angiographic results, procedure- related complications, and neurological events during follow- up were recorded. Angiographic follow- up data are available in 36 lesions 6 months after treatment. Results - Forty of 44 aneurysms ( 91%) could be treated with radioactive coils. Target activities could be reached in 88% of lesions that could actually be coiled ( 35/ 40). Total activities ranged from 1.72 to 80.9 mu Ci, for a mean of 20.13 +/- 20.80 mu Ci. Procedure- related complications occurred in 7% of patients. Initial angiographic results were satisfactory ( complete occlusions or residual necks) in 75% of lesions. Angiographic recurrences occurred in 11 ( 31%) of patients followed, within the expected range for standard coils. There was no complication from beta radiation during a mean follow- up period of 10 months. Conclusions - Radioactive coil embolization is feasible; target volumetric activities can be reached in most aneurysms considered for endovascular treatment.

In the present study, we developed a low-dose chronic MK-801 treatment regimen that induced persistent learning deficits (determined by the Morris water maze task) after administration of the drug (0.2 mg/kg) every 12 h for 14 days. To determine the impact of such a treatment, changes in mRNA expression were investigated in the hippocampi and striata of treated animals using a cDNA membrane array followed by Western blots. Genes whose expression levels were found to be most altered included preprolactin (downregulated) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP kinase 1; upregulated) in the hippocampus, and acyl-CoA synthetase (downregulated) and apolipoprotein D (upregulated) in the striatum. Furthermore, MAP kinase 1 and proteosome subunit beta precursor was found to meet selection criteria for upregulation in both the hippocampus and striatum. Among other genes found to be most changed in the hippocampus were protein kinase C beta I and II, protein tyrosine phosphatase 1beta, neuropilin I and II, adenosine receptor A1, and metabotropic glutamate receptor 2/3. The impact of some gene expression alterations on their corresponding protein levels was studied next. In the hippocampus, protein kinase C beta I and II, protein tyrosine phosphatase, neuropilin I and II, adenosine receptor A, metabotropic glutamate receptor 2/3, and in the striatum phosphatidyl inositol 4 kinase, mitogen-activated protein kinase 1, adenylyl cyclase II, dopamine receptors 1A and 2, and cytochrome C oxidase subunit Va gene and protein expression levels were found to be highly correlated. These results suggest the potential involvement of several genes and proteins in the neuropharmacological effects of MK-801 and possibly the persisting cognitive deficits induced by this repeated drug treatment.

In contrast, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is processed in the regulated secretory pathway, stored in vesicles, and released in response to neuronal activity, consistent with its role in modulating synaptic plasticity. In this study, we used vaccinia virus infection and transfection methods to monitor the processing and sorting of neurotrophin-4 (NT-4) in AtT-20 cells, which have been used as a model for the sorting of secretory proteins in neurons. Our data show that NT-4 is processed in the constitutive secretory pathway. The molecule is diffusely distributed within the cells and released, soon after being synthesized, in a manner that is not affected by cell depolarization. We further show that NT-4 and BDNF, when co-expressed, can form heterodimers that are constitutively released. In contrast, heterodimers of NT-3 and BDNF have been shown to be released through the regulated secretory pathway. Thus, NT-4, alone or when co-expressed with BDNF, is processed within and secreted by the constitutive secretory pathway.

We went through a critical review of the current status of neuroimaging studies of cognition. Thus, we argue why the use of a neuronal network perspective could led us to a better understanding of cognition than a localizationism perspective. Method. The question about how cognitive functions are organized in the brain, comes from the very early lesions studies. Electrocortical stimulation and the intracorotid amytal procedure collaborate together with lesions studies to increase the knowledge about the organization of cognitive functions in the brain. Functional neuroimaging could help to this issue answering the following questions: where, when and how the activity is produced in the brain. Many of the functional neuroimaging studies have addressed the question of where the activity is located, but very few has been concentrated into describe the spatio-temporal profiles of brain activity, and then how the neural networks which support cognition are organized. Taking into account just one of this perspectives (where or when) we could achieve a reductionism view of the problem. Conclusions. Executive function, memory or language are more distributed than located in just one area, even the different subprocesses that are included in each of this junctions are supported by a network rather than a particular area. We analyze the current available functional neuroimaging techniques under this view and its possibilities to describe the neural networks which support cognition.

Other GC-rich sequences coding for some polyalanine domains were found to be polymorphic in human. These observations prompted us to identify all sequences in the human genome coding for polyalanine stretches longer than four alanines and establish their degree of polymorphism. We identified 494 annotated human proteins containing 604 polyalanine domains. Thirty-two percent (31/98) of tested sequences coding for more than seven alanines were polymorphic. The length of the polyalanine-coding sequence and its GCG or GCC repeat content are the major predictors of polymorphism. GCG codons are over-represented in human polyalanine coding sequences. Our data suggest that GCG and GCC codons play a key role in polyalanine-coding sequence appearance and polymorphism. The grouping by shared function of polyalanine-containing proteins in Homo sapiens, Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans shows that the majority are involved in transcriptional regulation. Phylogenetic analyses of HOX, GATA and EVX protein families demonstrate that polyalanine domains arose independently in different members of these families, suggesting that convergent molecular evolution may have played a role. Finally polyalanine domains in vertebrates are conserved between mammals and are rarer and shorter in Gallus gallus and Danio rerio. Together our results show that the polymorphic nature of sequences coding for polyalanine domains makes them prime candidates for mutations in hereditary diseases and suggests that they have appeared in many different protein families through convergent evolution.

Over 20 years ago, pioneering work demonstrated that the non-permissive nature of CNS myelin for axon outgrowth contributes to this regenerative failure. Over the past few years, tremendous progress has been made in our understanding of the inhibitory components of CNS myelin, the axonal receptors that respond to these cues, and the intracellular signaling cascades mediating axon outgrowth inhibition. Several approaches designed to antagonize molecular mediators of axon inhibition have been tested in an effort to promote regenerative growth after CNS injury. These studies have validated the role of many candidate proteins in axon outgrowth inhibition; however, other approaches such as the generation of knockout mice for myelin-associated inhibitors have created new questions in the field.

In the present study, we investigated the effects of two stimulation patterns, theta-burst stimulation (TBS) and 100 Hz tetani, on pharmacologically isolated monosynaptic GABAergic responses in adult CA1 pyramidal cells. Tetanization with 100 Hz trains transiently depressed both early and late IPSPs, whereas TBS induced long-term potentiation (LTP) of early IPSPs that lasted at least 30 min. Mechanisms mediating this TBS-induced potentiation were examined using whole-cell recordings. The paired-pulse ratio of monosynaptic inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) was not affected during LTP, suggesting that presynaptic changes in GABA release are not involved in the potentiation. Bath application of the GABA(B) receptor antagonist CGP55845 or the group I/II metabotropic glutamate receptor antagonist E4-CPG inhibited IPSC potentiation. Preventing postsynaptic G-protein activation or Ca2+ rise by postsynaptic injection of GDP-beta-S or BAPTA, respectively, abolished LTP, indicating a G-protein- and Ca2+-dependent induction in this LTP. Finally during paired-recordings, activation of individual interneurons by intracellular TBS elicited solely short-term increases in average unitary IPSCs in pyramidal cells. These results indicate that a stimulation paradigm mimicking the endogenous theta rhythm activates cooperative postsynaptic mechanisms dependent on GABA(B)R, mGluR, G-proteins and intracellular Ca2+, which lead to a sustained potentiation of GABA(A) synaptic transmission in pyramidal cells. GABAergic synapses may therefore contribute to functional synaptic plasticity in adult hippocampus.

Compare the effectiveness of two different techniques for the management of osteoid osteoma of the spine. Objective. To describe the technique, feasibility, and indications of two different minimally invasive surgical methods for the treatment of osteoid osteoma of the spine. Summary of the Background Data. Current treatment of osteoid osteoma of the spine is usually conventional surgical excision. The successful treatment of osteoid osteoma of the appendicular skeleton by percutaneous radiofrequency probe ablation is known; however, there have been only a few cases reported utilizing this method to treat osteoid osteoma of the spine. The high success rate of percutaneous transpedicle vertebral biopsy and diskectomy led us to believe this technique can also be applicable for the treatment of osteoid osteoma of the spine. Methods. Two patients with symptomatic osteoid osteoma of the spine underwent two different surgical managements with local anesthesia. In one patient, the osteoid osteoma was localized in the apex of the right L4 superior articular process joint. Under computed tomography guidance he underwent radiofrequency coagulation with the use of a radiofrequency generator at 90degrees for 240 seconds. The lesion in the second patient was located in the right pedicle of the T9 vertebra close to the exiting nerve root and was cored out by means of a special percutaneous instrument designed for percutaneous biopsy under fluoroscopic guidance. Results. Both patients experienced immediate relief of pain, resumed their regular activities, and also remained free of symptoms after the 2.5- and 3- year follow- up. Conclusion. Minimally invasive surgery can successfully be applied in the treatment of osteoid osteoma of the lumbar spine. When the nidus is not adjacent to the neural elements radiofrequency thermal ablation can be an effective and safe treatment of osteoid osteoma in the spine.

In vitro, CNP specifically catalyzes the hydrolysis of 2',3'-cyclic nucleotides to produce 2'-nucleotides, but the physiologically relevant in vivo substrate remains obscure. Here, we report the medium resolution NMR structure of the catalytic domain of rat CNP with phosphate bound and describe its binding to CNP inhibitors. The structure has a bilobal arrangement of two modules, each consisting of a four-stranded beta-sheet and two alpha-helices. The beta-sheets form a large cavity containing a number of positively charged and aromatic residues. The structure is similar to those of the cyclic phosphodiesterase from Arabidopsis thaliana and the 2'-5' RNA ligase from Thermus thermophilus, placing CNP in the superfamily of 2H phosphodiesterases that contain two tetrapeptide HX(T/S)X motifs. NMR titrations of the CNP catalytic domain with inhibitors and kinetic studies of site-directed mutants reveal a protein conformational change that occurs upon binding.

For both N170 and the vertex positive potential (VPP) there was a linear increase in amplitude and decrease in latency with decreasing levels of noise. In contrast, the earlier visual PI component was stable across noise levels. The PI/N170 dissociation suggests not only a functional dissociation between low and high-level visual processing of faces but also that the N170 reflects the integration of sensorial information into a unitary representation. In addition, the N170/VPP association supports the view that they reflect the same processes operating when viewing faces.

We used fMRI to investigate whether parts of auditory cortex would be sensitive to the repetition of a speaker's voice. Subjects were scanned while passively listening to spoken syllables, presented in blocs in which either syllable or speaker were repeated. Only one cortical region, located in the anterior part of the right superior temporal sulcus (STS), responded differently to the two conditions: activation relative to the silent baseline was significantly reduced when syllables were spoken by a single voice than when they were spoken by different voices. This result suggest that the right anterior STS plays an important role in the representation of individual voices.

Using an animal model of repetitive colorectal distensions (CRD), we investigated the effect of spinal administration of tachykinin receptor antagonists in the mediation of visceral hypersensitivity. Intrathecal administration of the NK1 receptor antagonist RP-67,580 (6.5 nmol) and the NK3 receptor antagonist R-820 (6.5 nmol) completely blocked the CRD-induced hyperalgesia for both noxious and innocuous stimuli. The intrathecal administration of SR-48,968, a tachykinin NK2 receptor antagonist, did not affect the visceral pain threshold of hypersensitive animals. Thus, the results from the present experiment support the concept that tachykinins with actions at spinal NK1 and NK3 but not NK2 receptor sites are involved in visceral hypersensitivity mediated by nociceptive and non-nociceptive afferent inputs.

BK channels containing four sequence variants (V1-V4) in the four different isoforms of the beta-subunit (beta3a, beta3b, beta3c, and beta3d) were expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Reconstituted BK channel inactivation ranged from none to around 90% inactivation. In particular, channels expressing the beta3b-V4 variant displayed a right shift in the potassium current voltage-dependence of activation and inactivated to about 30% of the maximum conductance, compared with wild-type beta3b channels that showed no inactivation. When the membrane potential was depolarized, BK channels inactivated with a very rapid time course (similar to2-6 ms). This same variant was previously demonstrated to show subtly higher incidence in patients with idiopathic epilepsy (IE) compared with controls, especially when combined with variant V2 (combined heterozygotes). Furthermore, the gene maps to a region containing a susceptibility factor for this disorder. Taken together, these data suggest that neurons expressing BK channels composed of the beta3b-V4 variant subunit may experience reduced levels of inhibition and may therefore play permissive roles in high levels of neuronal activity that is characteristic of epilepsy.

As many r-proteins used for therapeutic and structural studies are naturally secreted or engineered to be secreted, a cost-effective serum-free culture medium that allows their efficient expression and purification is required. In an attempt to design such a serum-free medium, the effect of nine protein hydrolysates on cell proliferation, transfection efficiency, and volumetric productivity was evaluated using green fluorescent protein (GFP) and human placental secreted alkaline phosphate (SEAP) as reporter genes. The suspension growing, serum-free adapted HEK293SF-3F6 cell line was stably transfected with an EBNA1-expression vector to increase protein expression when using EBV oriP bearing plasmids. Compared to our standard serum-free medium, concomitant addition of the gelatin peptone N3 and removal of BSA slightly enhanced transfection efficiency and significantly increased volumetric productivity fourfold. Using the optimized medium formulation, transfection efficiencies between 40-60% were routinely obtained and SEAP production reached 18 mg/L-1. To date, we have successfully produced and purified over fifteen r-proteins from 1-14-L bioreactors using this serum-free system. As examples, we describe the scale-up of two secreted his-tagged r-proteins Tie-2 and Neuropilin-1 extracellular domains (ED) in bioreactors. Each protein was successfully purified to >95% purity following a single immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) step. In contrast, purification of Tie-2 and Neuropilin-1 produced in serum-containing medium was much less efficient. Thus, the use of our new serum-free EBNA1 cell line with peptone-enriched serum-free medium significantly improves protein expression compared to peptone-less medium, and significantly increases their purification efficiency compared to serum-containing medium. This eliminates labor-intensive and expensive chromatographic steps, and allows for the simple, reliable, and extremely fast production of milligram amounts of r-proteins within 5 days posttransfection.

Plasma homocysteine level is affected by vitamin intake and by sequence variation in enzymes of homocysteine metabolism. One such enzyme, methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), synthesizes 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, utilized in homocysteine remethylation to methionine. A variant of the MTHFR gene at base pair 677 is associated with reduced activity, increased thermolability, and hyperhomocysteinemia. This variant has been reported to increase risk of the aforementioned disorders. However, not all studies examining disease risk with respect to MTHFR genotype have reported a statistically significant relation. The current authors hypothesized that the effect of the variant might be stronger in younger age groups, as is the case with other genetic risk factors. Thus, the authors examined data from three North American studies: a study of mothers of spina bifida children and control mothers (1995-1996; n = 136); the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Family Heart Study (1994-1995; n = 537); and a Mayo Clinic study of patients undergoing coronary angiography (1998-1999; n = 504). In each study, the effect of MTHFR genotype on plasma homocysteine level was statistically significant only in younger age groups. Failure to examine younger patients separately may explain why some studies have found no association between the genotype and cardiovascular disease.

After 2 wk of rapid ventricular pacing in nine anesthetized canines, cardiac and right atrial neuronal function were evaluated in situ in response to enhanced cardiac sensory inputs, stimulation of extracardiac autonomic efferent neuronal inputs, and close coronary arterial administration of neurochemicals that included nicotine. Right atrial neuronal intracellular electrophysiological properties were then evaluated in vitro in response to synaptic activation and nicotine. Intrinsic cardiac nicotine-sensitive, neuronally induced cardiac responses were also evaluated in eight sham-operated, unpaced animals. Two weeks of rapid ventricular pacing reduced the cardiac index by 54%. Intrinsic cardiac neurons of paced hearts maintained their cardiac mechano- and chemosensory transduction properties in vivo. They also responded normally to sympathetic and parasympathetic preganglionic efferent neuronal inputs, as well as to locally administered alpha- or beta-adrenergic agonists or angiotensin II. The dose of nicotine needed to modify intrinsic cardiac neurons was 50 times greater in failure compared with normal preparations. That dose failed to alter monitored cardiovascular indexes in failing preparations. Phasic and accommodating neurons identified in vitro displayed altered intracellular membrane properties compared with control, including decreased membrane resistance, indicative of reduced excitability. Early-stage heart failure differentially affects the intrinsic cardiac nervous system's capacity to regulate cardiodynamics. While maintaining its capacity to transduce cardiac mechano- and chemosensory inputs, as well as inputs from extracardiac autonomic efferent neurons, intrinsic cardiac nicotine-sensitive, local-circuit neurons differentially remodel such that their capacity to influence cardiodynamics becomes obtunded.

Surgical ablation of the PAGP (PAGPx) attenuated vagally mediated bradycardia by 26%; it reduced heart rate slowing evoked by vagal stimulation superimposed on sympathetically mediated tachycardia by 36%. RAGP ablation (RAGPx) eliminated vagally mediated bradycardia, while retaining the vagally induced suppression of sympathetic-mediated tachycardia (- 83%). After combined RAGPx and PAGPx, vagal stimulation still reduced sympathetic-mediated tachycardia ( - 47%). After RAGPx alone and after PAGPx alone, stimulation of the vagi still produced negative dromotropic effects, although these changes were attenuated compared with the intact state. Negative dromotropic responses to vagal stimulation were further attenuated after combined ablation, but parasympathetic inhibition of atrioventricular nodal conduction was still demonstrable in most animals. Finally, neither RAGPx nor PAGPx altered autonomic regulation of right atrial inotropic function. These data indicate that multiple aggregates of neurons within the intrinsic cardiac nervous system are involved in sinoatrial nodal regulation. Whereas parasympathetic efferent neurons regulating the right atrium, including the sinoatrial node, are primarily located within the RAGP, prejunctional parasympathetic-sympathetic interactions regulating right atrial function also involve neurons within the PAGP.

In normal adults, these regions are activated by listening to speech-like sounds. To investigate auditory cortical processing in autism, the authors performed a positron emission tomography activation study. Method: Regional cerebral blood flow was measured in five autistic adults and eight comparison subjects during rest and while listening to speech-like sounds. Results: Similar to the comparison subjects, autistic patients showed a bilateral activation of the superior temporal gyrus. However, an abnormal pattern of hemispheric activation was observed in the autistic group. The volume of activation was larger on the right side in the autistic patients, whereas the reverse pattern was found in the comparison group. The direct comparison between the two groups showed that the right middle frontal gyrus exhibited significantly greater activation in the autistic group. Conversely, the left temporal areas exhibited less activation in autistic patients. Conclusions: These findings suggest that abnormal auditory cortical processing is implicated in the language impairments and the inadequate response to sounds typically seen in autism.

It was hypothesized that ultrasonic guidance would increase the proportion of successful blocks, decrease block execution time, and reduce the incidence of complications such as pneumothorax and neuropathy. Eighty patients were randomized into two groups of 40, Group US (supraclavicular block guided in real time by a two-dimensional ultrasonic image, with neurostimulator confirmation of correct needle position) and Group NS (supraclavicular block using the subclavian perivascular approach, also with neurostimulator confirmation). Blocks were performed using bupivacaine 0.5% and lidocaine 2% (1:1 vol) with epinephrine 1:200,000 as the anesthetic mixture. The onset of motor and sensory block for the musculocutaneous median, radial, and ulnar nerves was evaluated over a 30 min period. At 30 min 95% of patients in Group US and 85% of patients in Group NS had a partial or complete sensory block of all nerve territories (P = 0.13) and 55% of patients in Group US and 65% of patients in Group NS had a complete block of all nerve territories (P = 0.25). Surgical anesthesia without supplementation was achieved in 85% of patients in Group US and 78% of patients in Group NS (P = 0.28). No patient in Group US and 8% of patients in Group NS required general anesthesia (P = 0.12). The quality of ulnar block was significantly inferior to the quality of block in other nerve territories in Group NS, but not in Group US; the quality of ulnar block was not significantly different between Groups NS and US. The block was performed in an average of 9.8 min in Group NS and 5.0 min in Group US (P = 0.0001). No major complication occurred in either group. We conclude that ultrasound-guided neurostimulator-confirmed supraclavicular block is more rapidly performed and provides a more complete block than supraclavicular block using anatomic landmarks and neurostimulator confirmation.

She was reanimated and then transferred to the intensive care unit; the endotracheal intubation had been difficult, and she had been severely hypoxic. It was noted that the external venous clamp of the tunneled catheter was broken and the hypothesis of a break during the reanimation process was entertained. The routine chest x-ray postintubation showed that the tip of the catheter was ruptured and visible in one branch of the right pulmonary artery. The catheter was changed over a guide wire, and the broken catheter was sent for analysis to the manufacturer. A selective angiography of the right pulmonary artery was performed with the purpose of removing the fractured catheter tip but was unsuccessful. The patient recovered neurologic function slowly over the next 4 months. The exact etiology of the arrest remains incompletely understood; it is unknown whether it was caused by the catheter tip embolization or if an air embolism occurred.

Although remarkable kinetic variability was observed among bursts in terms of intraburst opening probability and mean open and closed times, the values of time constants describing intraburst open times (tau(o(b))s) and closed times (tau(o(b)) s) were distributed around well-defined peaks. At - 40 mV, tau(o(b)) peaks were found at similar to 0.34 (tau(o(b))1) and 0.77 (tau(o(b))2) ms, and major tau(c(b)) peaks were found at similar to0.24 (tau(c(b)) 1) and 0.54 (tau(c(b))2) ms. In similar to80% of the bursts two preferential gating modes were found that consisted of a combination of either tau(o(b)) 1 and tau(c(b))2 ("intraburst mode 1''), or tau(o(b)) 2 and tau(c(b)) 1 ("intraburst mode 2''). Individual channels could switch between different gating modalities, but normally tended to maintain a specific gating mode for long periods. Mean burst duration also displayed considerable variability. At least three time constants were found to describe burst duration, and the frequencies at which each of the corresponding "bursting states'' occurred varied in different channels. Short-lasting bursting states were preferentially associated with intraburst mode 1, whereas very-long-lasting bursts tended to gate according to mode 2 only or other modes that included considerably longer mean open times. These results show that I-NaP channels can generate multiple intraburst open and closed states and bursting states, but these different kinetic states tend to combine in definite ways to produce a limited number of prevalent, well-defined gating modalities. Modulation of distinct gating modalities in individual Na+ channels may be a powerful form of plasticity to influence neuronal excitability and function.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate in vivo the chemical and structural integrity of the thalamus in patients with IGE. Thalamic proton magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (1H-MRSI), measuring N-acetylaspartate (NAA), choline-containing compounds and creatine (Cr) was performed in 20 IGE patients and in a group of age-matched healthy subjects. Additionally, 1H-MRSI measurements were taken in the insular cortex, the posterior temporal lobe white matter and the splenium of the corpus callosum. MRI volumetric analysis of the thalamus was performed in all patients. At the time of the examination, seizures were well controlled in 10 IGE patients and poorly controlled in nine. One patient was newly diagnosed and had the MRI and MRSI examination prior to starting the antiepileptic medication. In IGE patients, 1H-MRSI showed a reduction of mean thalamic NAA/Cr compared with normal controls; no difference was found in NAA/Cr in the other examined areas. There was no difference in NAA/Cr between patients whose seizures were well controlled and those in whom seizures were not controlled. There was no correlation between thalamic NAA/Cr and mean number of spike and wave complexes. We found a significant negative correlation between thalamic NAA/Cr and duration of epilepsy. The mean thalamic volume in patients with IGE was not different from normal controls. These results show evidence of progressive thalamic neuronal dysfunction in patients with IGE supporting the notion of abnormal thalamo-cortical circuitry as a substrate of seizure generation in this form of epilepsy. The thalamic dysfunction may occur regardless of amount of spike and wave activity.

The aim of this study was to test RHD subjects' ability to process non-literal speech acts. A chronometric approach to RHD and matched control performance showed that RHD subjects are impaired in the processing of non-literal speech, though they are also sensitive to the hierarchy of complexity among types. Only the processing of indirect speech acts was not shown to differ from that of normals, probably because the stimuli were of the conventional type. These results show the relevancy of a chronometric approach. They also emphasize the importance of further studying RHD subjects' ability to attribute intentions to protagonists in a short story.

Clinically, without DBS, tremor amplitude varied from absent to high. Tremor was recorded continuously for about 5 min under three conditions of DBS repeated twice, namely, effective frequency (E), ineffective frequency (I), and no DBS (O). No changes in tremor were observed across conditions in subjects with little or no tremor. However, in subjects with moderate to large amplitude tremor, DBS decreased tremor amplitude to near normal values within a few seconds. Generally, transitions were progressive and occurred with a varying time delay. Occasionally, tremor escaped from control regardless of the stimulation condition considered. In some cases tremor amplitude in one condition appeared to depend on the preceding condition. Finally, the results were reproducible on two consecutive days.

The aim of the present study was to investigate spontaneous EEG lateralization under two conditions, waking and REM sleep. Bilateral monopolar EEG was recorded in eight participants using a 12-electrode montage, before the night (5 min eyes closed) and during REM sleep. Spectral analysis (0.75-19.75 Hz) revealed left prefrontal lateralization on total spectrum amplitude power and right occipital lateralization in Delta activity during waking. In contrast, during REM sleep, right frontal lateralization in Theta and Beta activities and right lateralization in occipital Delta activity was observed. These results suggest that spontaneous EEG activities generated during waking and REM sleep are supported in part by a common thalamo-cortical neural network (right occipital Delta dominance) while additional, possibly neuro-cognitive factors modulate waking left prefrontal dominance and REM sleep right frontal dominance.

Her amnesia is relatively isolated and her deficit does not embrace other cognitive domains. G.D. underwent extensive neuropsychological evaluation including language, executive functions, perceptual, and memory tests. Based on clinical observation, the purpose of this study was to determine whether there was a dissociation between her autobiographical and semantic memory. Results point out a severely degraded semantic knowledge of famous public events and persons while autobiographical memory of personally experienced and relevant information remains intact. Results from this study and from previous studies seem to suggest that relative sparing of hippocampal structures may be related to the preservation of autobiographical memory. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc.

We investigated the neural correlates of the AB using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Twelve subjects viewed rapid streams of black letters in which were embedded two white target letters (T1 and T2) separated by either 300 or 700ms. As expected, fewer correct T2 identifications were observed in the short-delay condition. Corresponding fMRI statistical images showed increased activation in inferotemporal and posterior parietal cortex, but also in lateral frontal cortex and cerebellum in the short-delay condition suggesting that these brain regions are associated with perceptual decisions under masking interference.

Indeed, the semantic impairments of right hemisphere damaged (RHD) subjects may be the expression of limited general cognitive resources rather than a specific impairment of semantic processing (Monetta, Hamel, Joanette, 2001; Murray, 2000). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the possibility that the N400 reflect the availability of cognitive resources through an analysis of its different amplitudes according to different semantic complexity level. Ten young adults without any history of neurological damage participated in a semantic categorization task with two different levels of difficulty based on prototypicality. Event related potential (ERP) signals from 64 electrodes were recorded. An N400 was observed during the processing of difficult words and distractors. The results show that the greatest N400 activation was observed during the processing of difficult words, thus reflecting a possible increase in the amount of required cognitive resources.

Ten right- and 10 left-hemisphere-damaged subjects, and 20 normal control subjects were submitted to: (1) a word-triad task where they had to associate alternative metaphoric and non-metaphoric words to a target word, and to (2) a word-dyad task where they had to decide whether or not there was a semantic relationship between two words. The two tasks aimed at differentiating between the subjects' preference for a given semantic meaning versus a genuine semantic deficit for a particular meaning. Results revealed that both right- and left-hemisphere-damaged groups presented a genuine semantic deficit for the processing of metaphoric meaning. The absence of a double dissociation between the two brain-damaged groups does not support the hypothesis of a specific contribution of the right-hemisphere to the processing of metaphoric meaning of words.

Following the work of Marslen-Wilson, Tyler, Warren, Gremer, and Lee (1992), a cross-modal lexical decision task was performed by LHD and RHD subjects, as well as by adults without brain pathology (NC). Subjects listened to sentences with attachment ambiguities with either congruent or incongruent prosody, while performing a visual lexical decision task. Results showed that each of the unilaterally damaged populations differed from each other, as well as from the NCs in terms of sensitivity regarding prosodic cues. Specifically, the RHD group was insensitive to sentence prosody as a whole. This was in contrast to the LHD patients, who responded to the prosodic manipulation, but in the unexpected direction. Results are discussed in terms of current hypotheses regarding the hemispheric lateralization of prosodic cues. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science (USA). All rights reserved.

Methods: Ninety-one patients were enrolled in this prospective, randomized, multicentre study. Anesthesia was induced with thiopental and remifentanil (1.0 mug(.)kg(-1) bolus and a 1 mug(.)kg(-1.)min(-1) infusion) or fentanyl (1 mug(.)kg(-1) bolus and a 1.0 mug(.)kg(-1.)min(-1) infusion). The opioid infusion continued until the level of anesthesia was deemed appropriate for intubation. Anesthesia was maintained with N2O/O-2, isoflurane 0.5 MAC and remifentanil 0.2 mug(.)kg(-1.)min(-1) or fentanyl 0.04 mug(.)kg(-1.)min(-1). At bone flap replacement, either morphine 0.08 mg(.)kg(-1) (remifentanil group) or saline (fentanyl group) was given. Results: Systolic blood pressure was greater in those receiving fentanyl during induction (145.6 +/- 17.5 mmHg vs 128.8 +/- 18.3 mmHg; P = 0.006) and intubation (126.9 +/- 17.1 vs 110.9 +/- 16.5 mmHg; P < 0.001). Median time to tracheal extubation was similar but less variable in the remifentanil group (remifentanil = 8 min: range = 2-44 min; fentanyl = 8 min: range = 1-732 min). The fentanyl patients required a longer time to achieve the first normal neurological score (fentanyl = 38.0 min; remifentanil = 26.0 min; P = 0.035). Both the anesthesiologists and the recovery room nurses rated remifentanil better with respect to level of consciousness. Analgesics were required earlier in patients receiving remifentanil; median time 0.5 vs 1.08 hr, P < 0.001. Conclusions: Remifentanil is a suitable alternative to fentanyl in supratentorial craniotomy. Time to preoperative neurological recovery is faster and morphine provides some transitional analgesia without compromising the quality of recovery.

We report a distal fusiform mycotic pseudoaneurysm of the anterior inferior cerebellar artery (AICA) that simulated an acoustic neuroma on presentation. Methods: A 60-year-old woman was investigated for recent onset of acute dizziness. Laboratory and radiographic investigations are presented, as well as the surgical management of the patient and pathological examination of the aneurysm. Conclusions: An exceptionally rare case of distal mycotic intracanalicular pseudoaneurysm of the AICA with intraluminal thrombus and fusiform anatomy is described. In our review of the literature (1966-present), only five other intracanalicular AICA-aneurysms were encountered, none of which were infectious in etiology. The possible pathophysiologic mechanisms of distal AICA-aneurysms are discussed along with the currently available literature.

It is important to determine if the same is true in Canada. Methods: Skiers and snowboarders (<18 years) presenting to 16 selected emergency departments from 1991 to 1999 were assigned one body region of injury in the following order: i) brain and spine-spinal cord, ii) head and neck, iii) face, iv) other body region (i.e., controls). Crude and adjusted (age, gender, helmet use and hospital admission) odds ratios indicating the proportion of head, brain, face, and neck injury relative to controls by calendar year were estimated. Injury rates were examined for 12 to 17 year olds over the last 4 years of the study. Results: Compared with 1997-1999, there was a lower proportion of skier head injuries from 1991-93 (adjusted odds ratio (AOR)=0.16; 95% Confidence Interval (CI)=0.09-0.30) and from 1995-97 (AOR=0.71; 95% CI=0.49-1.04). The proportion of skier brain injuries was lower from 1993-95 (AOR=0.69; 95% CI=0.44-1.07) and from 1995-97 (AOR=0.56; 95% CI: 0.35-0.91). In snowboarders, however, compared with 1997-99, there was evidence that although the proportion of head injuries was lower from 1991-93 (AOR=0.19; 95% CI=0.05-0.80), the opposite was true for facial injuries. For 12 to 17 year olds, skier brain and snowboarder head and neck injury rates increased from 1995-99. Conclusions: The results suggest that head and brain injuries in skiers and head and neck injuries in snowboarders may be increasing, particularly in adolescents.

Experimental Design: We used a methylation-specific PCR assay to determine the methylation status of the MGMT promoter in the DNA molecules extracted from CRC and nontumor tissue samples from 116 patients who had undergone CRC surgery and for whom clinical outcome information was available on file. Results: We found evidence of MGMT promoter hypermethylation in 26 of 90 CRC cases, and we noted that the later the stage at which a tumor was diagnosed, the less likely its MGMT promoter was to be methylated (P = 0.03, adjusting for chemotherapy), especially for stage D patients (P = 0.01). We also found that CRC patients with unmethylated MGMT promoters were much more likely to experience recurrence within 36 months than patients with hypermethylated MGMT promoters (crude odds ratio, 14.0; 95% confidence interval, 2.42-81.01). After adjustment for stage, CRC patients with unmethylated MGMT promoters who had been exposed to chemotherapy were found to have a 5.3-fold greater risk of recurrence than those who had no exposure to chemotherapy (95% confidence interval, 1.15-30.92). Conclusions: Hypermethylation of the MGMT promoter may be predictive of a low risk of recurrence in CRC patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy.

It is characterized by two major symptoms, excessive daytime sleepiness and cataplexy, and two so-called auxiliary symptoms, hypnagogic hallucinations and sleep paralysis. The final diagnosis relies on polysomnography showing the presence of sleep onset rapid eye movement periods (SOREMPs) during the multiple sleep latency test. The presence of HLA DQA1*0102-DQB1*0602 is supportive of the diagnosis. The pathophysiology of the disorder is still unknown but an imbalance between monoamines and acetylcholine is generally accepted. Recent findings in narcoleptic dogs, a natural model of narcolepsy, and in knockout mice revealed that a mutation of type 2 hypocretin receptor plays a major role in the etiology of narcolepsy. Up to now, no mutation has been found in humans except a case of early onset and atypical narcolepsy. However, a marked reduction of hypocretin type 1 has been found in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of a majority of patients and a global loss of hypocretins was noted in post-mortem brain tissue of narcoleptic subjects. Conversely, no hypocretin neuron degeneration has been observed in the genetic form of narcolepsy in dogs but no trace of hypocretin was seen in the brain or the CSF in cases of sporadic canine narcolepsy. This suggests that different hypocretinergic mechanisms are involved in sporadic and genetic forms of canine narcolepsy. Treatment has not evolved significantly over the last few years. However, new drugs, such as hypocretin agonists, are currently being developed. Significance: After the discovery of the type 2 hypocretin receptor mutation in canine narcolepsy and the finding of a CSF hypocretin-1 deficiency in human narcolepsy, the major stream of research has involved the hypocretinergic system. However, other lines of research deserve to be pursued simultaneously, in view of comprehensive advancements in the understanding of narcolepsy.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of age and gender on HR changes associated with PLMS in restless legs syndrome (RLS) patients. Methods: Forty-two RLS patients underwent one night of polysomnographic recordings. They were divided into 3 groups of 14 subjects (7 women and 7 men) according to age, i.e. young (25-40 years), middle-aged (41-55 years) and elderly (56-71 years) patients. The RR interval was calculated for 5 intervals before and 15 intervals after the onset of 50 PLMS in each patient. Results: PLMS were associated with HR changes characterized by a tachycardia followed by a bradycardia. However, a reduction in the tachycardia and the bradycardia was observed with age. Moreover, women showed a higher amplitude in the bradycardia than men. No age or gender difference was found for MA index and duration. Conclusions: This study showed age and gender differences in the magnitude of the HR changes associated with PLMS. The knowledge of HR variations during sleep, including rapid HR changes associated with sleep events such as PLMS or MA, may be helpful in understanding the potential mechanisms involved in the increased cardiac risk observed in elderly.

Here, we show that two proteins identified through a proteomics analysis of CCVs are new components of the endocytic machinery. The proteins, named NECAP (adaptin-ear-binding coat-associated protein) 1 and 2, are paralogues that display no sequence similarity or common domains with any known protein. Both are enriched in CCV coats, and further analysis of the brain-enriched isoform, NECAP 1, shows its partial localization to clathrin-coated pits and direct binding to the globular ear domain of the alpha-adaptin subunit (alpha-ear) of the adaptor protein 2 (AP-2) complex. Intriguingly, this interaction is mediated by a new motif, WVQF, that uses a distinct alpha-ear interface relative to known alpha-ear-binding partners. Disruption of this interaction blocks clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Together, our studies identify a new family of endocytic proteins that define a unique AP-2-binding motif.

Such naturally occurring variations in maternal behavior are associated with differences in estrogen-inducible oxytocin receptors in the medial preoptic area (MPOA) of the hypothalamus. We compared levels of ERalpha and ERbeta mRNA in the MPOA of lactating High or Low LG mothers as well as in their non-lactating, female offspring, which inherit the maternal phenotype of their mothers. Among lactating females, High LG females exhibited significantly elevated levels of ERalpha mRNA compared with Low LG females. Likewise, the adult, virgin female offspring of High LG mothers showed higher levels of ERalpha mRNA in the MPOA compared with those of Low LG mothers. There were no group differences in levels of ERbeta mRNA. Differences in ERalpha protein expression in the MPOA were confirmed using Western blot analysis. To further characterize the effects of estrogen in the MPOA, cFos immunoreactivity was compared in ovariectomized, adult offspring of High and Low LG dams treated with estradiol or oil. Increased cFos activity in the anterior ventral nucleus of the MPOA was observed in estradiol-treated High LG, but not Low LG females. These findings suggest that natural variations in maternal care are associated with differences in ERalpha expression in the MPOA and that such differences are transmitted from the mother to her female offspring.

Offspring reared by mothers who exhibit increased levels of pup licking/grooming (LG) show increased hippocampal synaptic density and enhanced spatial learning and memory. Using 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU), a thymidine analogue incorporated into cells during DNA synthesis, we examined the effects of early maternal care on hippocampal cell proliferation and neuronal survival in the rat. Twenty-four hours following injection on day 7 of life (P7) there were no differences in BrdU labelling in the offspring of high- compared with low-LG mothers, suggesting no maternal effect on the rate of proliferation at this age. However, 14 and 83 days following injection (P21 and P90), the offspring of high-LG mothers had significantly more surviving BrdU-labelled cells and BrdU-NeuN(+)-colabelled neurons in the dentate gyrus subgranular zone and granule cell layer. At P21, the offspring of high-LG mothers showed increased protein expression of basic fibroblast growth factor and significantly decreased levels of pyknosis. These findings suggest an influence of maternal care on neuronal survival in the hippocampus. Conversely, at the same time point there was a significantly higher level of hippocampal glial fibrillary acidic protein expression in the offspring of low-LG mothers. These findings emphasize the importance of early maternal care for hippocampal development.

Mutations in the sialidase gene NEU1, located on chromosome 6p21.3, result in autosomal recessive disorder, sialidosis, which is characterized by the progressive lysosomal storage of sialylated glycopeptides and oligosaccharides. Sialidosis type I is a milder, late-onset, normosomatic form of the disorder. Type I patients develop visual defects, myoclonus syndrome, cherry-red macular spots, ataxia, hyperreflexia, and seizures. The severe early-onset form, sialidosis type II, is also associated with dysostosis multiplex, Hurler,like phenotype, mental retardation, and hepatosplenomegaly. We summarize information on the 34 unique mutations determined so far in the sialidase gene, including four novel missense and one novel nonsense mutations found in two Czech and two French sialidosis patients. The analysis of sialidase mutations in sialidosis revealed considerable molecular heterogeneity, reflecting the diversity of clinical phenotypes that make molecular diagnosis difficult. The majority of sialidosis patients have had missense mutations, many of which have been expressed; their effects on activity, stability, intracellular localization, and supramolecular organization of sialidase were studied. A structural model of sialidase allowed us to localize mutations in the sialidase molecule and to predict their impact on the tertiary structure and biochemical properties of the enzyme.

The visual deficit in amblyopia involves both elevated contrast thresholds and distorted suprathreshold percepts at high spatial frequencies. It is currently unclear whether these two anomalies are part of the same neural disturbance or whether they reflect different neural dysfunction. METHODS. The quality of the spatial percepts in amblyopia was assessed at detection threshold. The ability of amblyopes to discriminate the orientation and local spatial phase of well-localized spatial stimuli was measured at the detection threshold. Measurements were made as a function of spatial frequency. RESULTS. Performance seemed normal for orientation discrimination, even at high spatial frequencies, but, in some cases, it was disturbed in phase discrimination. CONCLUSIONS. A different explanation and neural basis is needed to encompass both threshold and suprathreshold spatial deficits in amblyopia.

Because integrin-mediated extracellular matrix recognition is crucial during the cell adhesion processes involved in carcinogenesis, we have investigated the effects of EGCG on different cellular integrins of the pediatric brain tumor-derived medulloblastoma cell line DAOY. Using flow cytometry, we report the levels of expression of several cell surface integrins in DAOY. These include high expression of alpha2, alpha3, and beta1 integrins, as well as alphav and beta3 integrins. Moreover, we provide evidence that EGCG can antagonize DAOY cell migration specifically on collagen by increasing cell adhesive ability through specific gene and protein upregulation of the beta1 integrin subunit. Our results suggest that this naturally occurring green tea polyphenol may thus be used as a nutraceutical therapeutic agent in targeting the invasive character of medulloblastomas.

We propose that neural innervation of the gonad allows H. aspersa to monitor oocyte production and ensure an adequate supply of gametes prior to ovulation. The ovotestis is innervated by a branch of the intestinal nerve in which the majority of axon fibres measure <0.2 mum in diameter. We found a strong positive correlation between the number of mature oocytes in the ovotestis and the frequency of spontaneous afferent spikes in the nerve branch. Tactile stimulation of the ovotestis resulted in a 20-fold increase in afferent spikes and an efferent reflex directed towards the ovotestis and the pericardium. Afferent activity also increased 10-fold after an experimentally induced increase in the volume of the ovotestis. These results suggest that the growing oocytes expand the walls of the acini and trigger action potentials in the mechanosensitive nerve terminals that lie within the acinar walls. We hypothesize that the resulting tonic signal is permissive for ovulation. In addition, a phasic sensory signal may occur during ovulation to trigger CNS motor output related to oviposition.

Participants: Eight young, high-functioning adults with TBI and 4 healthy subjects. Main outcome measures: Spatiotemporal gait parameters and their relation to specific clinical measures of severity and locomotor and balance abilities. Results: Subjects with TBI walked slower and showed a tendency for greater foot clearances in all conditions. Slower walking was due to decreased stride lengths and not cadence, while higher foot clearances were due to placing the trailing foot farther from the obstacle and increasing hip flexion angles during avoidance. Conclusions: The results suggest that this highly functional TBI population used increased caution. Measures of injury severity did not provide simple predictions of locomotor ability, but the one-legged stance test with eyes closed correlated to walking capacity.

Recently, P-gp has been reported to be located in the caveolae of multidrug-resistant cells. In this study, we investigated the localization and the activity of P-gp in the caveolae of endothelial cells of the BBB. We used an in vitro model of the BBB which is formed by co-culture of bovine brain capillary endothelial cells (BBCEC) with astrocytes. Caveolar microdomains isolated from BBCEC are enriched in P-gp, cholesterol, caveolin-1, and caveolin-2. Moreover, P-gp interacts with caveolin-1 and caveolin-2; together, they form a high molecular mass complex. P-gp in isolated caveolae is able to bind its substrates, and the caveolae-disrupting agents filipin III and nystatin decrease P-gp transport activity. In addition, mutations in the caveolin-binding motif present in P-gp reduced the interaction of P-gp with caveolin-1 and increased the transport activity of P-gp. Thus, P-gp expressed at the BBB is mainly localized in caveolae and its activity may be modulated by interaction with caveolin-1.

Here, we investigated whether an attenuated response to the positive-feedback effects of oestrogen on luteinizing hormone release contributed to this effect. The ability of oestrogen to induce surges in luteinizing hormone in ad libitum fed and food-restricted dams at different times of lactation was compared. The results showed that, on day 20 postpartum, ad libitum fed dams showed luteinizing hormone surges after oestrogen treatment, but food-restricted dams did not. Ovariectomy or RU486 treatment restored the ability of oestrogen to induce luteinizing hormone surges in food-restricted dams, and chronic progesterone exposure reduced oestrogen-induced surges of luteinizing hormone in ad libitum fed ovariectomized dams. Food restriction also resulted in a reduced ability of oestrogen to induce progesterone receptor immunoreactivity, but did not reduce the number of oestrogen receptors (ERalpha) in the anteroventralperiventricular area. As with the surge in luteinizing hormone, the effects of food restriction on oestrogen induction of progesterone receptors were mediated by progesterone. Together, these results suggest that the ability of food restriction to extend the length of lactational diestrus is mediated, in part, by a decrease in sensitivity to the positive-feedback effects of oestrogen. This results from high circulating concentrations of progesterone which apparently reduce the ability of oestrogen to induce progesterone receptor expression.

MBs arising in the cerebellum represent the most common malignant brain tumors in children. In this study we have analyzed the sequence, methylation, and expression status of the HIC-1 gene in MBs. Hypermethylation of the 5'UTR and/or second exon of HIC-1 was detected in 33/39 (85%) of MB biopsies and in 7/8 (88%) of MB cell lines by methylation-specific PCR. There was a significant correlation (p < 0.001) between HIC-1 methylation and lack of transcription as determined by competitive RT-PCR. Treatment of the MB cell lines Daoy and MEB-MED-8A with 5-aza-2'deoxycytidine led to re-expression of HIC-1 transcripts, indicating a silencing of HIC-1 by CpG island methylation. Mutation analysis of the coding region of HIC-1 revealed a single deletion leading to an in-frame deletion of 4 amino acids in the second exon of HIC-1 (1/68, 1.5%). Our data indicate that a significant number of MBs exhibit strikingly reduced HIC-1 expression caused by altered CpG island methylation. These data suggest that epigenetic silencing of HIC-1 may well contribute to the pathogenesis in the majority of MBs.

Case reports of post-lesion nonparoxysmal hallucination in 1 (and only 1) of 3 sensory modalities (i.e., visual, auditory, somatic) were reviewed, and the content of the qualitative descriptions was analyzed for each modality. The lesion is practically always located in the brain pathway of the sensory modality of the hallucination. There seem to exist localized sensory brain circuits that in healthy people diminish the intensity of internal sensory representation. After a lesion, hallucinosis seems to be caused also by compensatory overactivation of tissue in the nearby brain sensory pathway. This type of hallucination may indeed be termed a "release" form, whereby patients are aware of the hallucinatory nature of their experience, but not usually of "dream centres" as proposed by Lhermitte. Instead, we propose that it is dreaming that should be considered a special case of neural "release."

In the present study, we assessed whether a mixture that was simultaneously deficient in tryptophan, phenylalanine and tyrosine could induce sufficient protein synthesis that plasma levels of all 3 monoamine precursors would decrease. Design: Ten healthy volunteers (5 male, 5 female) were administered a tryptophan/phenylalanine/tyrosine-deficient AA mixture in an open-label study. Plasma concentrations of large neutral AAs were measured before and 5 hours after mixture ingestion. Results: The tryptophan/phenylalanine/tyrosine-deficient mixture lowered plasma concentrations of the 3 AAs by 67%, 78% and 77%, respectively (p less than or equal to 0.001); their ratio to other large neutral AAs was decreased more, namely, by 87%, 90% and 90% (p less than or equal to 0.001). Mood lowering was seen on 3 subscales of the bipolar Profile of Mood States, that is, elated-depressed, composed-anxious and clearheaded-confused, as well as 2 visual analog scales, bored and irritated (p less than or equal to 0.05). Conclusions: Acute tryptophan/phenylalanine/tyrosine depletion may be a suitable new method for rapidly decreasing serotonin and catecholamine transmission simultaneously.

We report here that transgenic (Tg) mice expressing even low levels of Nef in oligodendrocytes under the regulation of the myelin basic protein (MBP) promoter (MBP/HIVNef) developed VM similar to the human disease in its appearance and topography. The spinal cords of these Tg mice showed lower levels of the myelin proteins MAG and CNPase and of the 21-kDa isoform of MBP prior to the development of vacuoles. In addition, Tg oligodendrocytes in primary in vitro cultures appeared morphologically more mature but, paradoxically, exhibited a less mature phenotype based on O4, O1, CNPase, and MBP staining. In particular, mature CNPase(+) MBP+ Tg oligodendrocytes were less numerous than non-Tg oligodendrocytes. Therefore, Nef appears to affect the proper differentiation of oligodendrocytes. These data suggest that even low levels of Nef expression in human oligodendrocytes may be responsible for the development of VM in HIV-1-infected individuals.

Systemic injections mimicked NGF in eliciting sprouting of nociceptive nerves without affecting their regeneration. The sprouting was prevented by anti-NGF treatment, implicating endogenous NGF. We detected no Neotrofin-induced increases in cutaneous NGF levels or in retrograde NGF transport. In contrast, both NGF and phosphorylation of trkA increased significantly in DRGs, with a marginal appearance of phosphorylated trkA in axons. We conclude that the DRG effects of Neotrofin are responsible for its induction of sprouting. Neotrofin also induced a striking phosphorylation of axonal erk 1 and 2, which was, however, unaffected by anti-NGF treatment. We suggest that this NGF-independent MAP kinase activation is involved in nonsprouting functions of Neotrofin such as neuroprotection. Unlike injected NGF, Neotrofin did not induce hyperalgesia, supporting its candidacy as a treatment for peripheral neuropathies like those induced by diabetes and anticancer chemotherapy.

Here we investigated if FGF-2 upregulation in adult RGCs promoted axon regrowth in vivo after acute optic nerve injury. Recombinant adeno-associated virus (AAV) was used to deliver the FGF-2 gene to adult RGCs providing a sustained source of this neurotrophic factor. FGF-2 gene transfer led to a 10-fold increase in the number of axons that extended past 0.5 mm from the lesion site compared to control nerves. Detection of AAV-mediated FGF-2 protein in injured RGC axons correlated with growth into the distal optic nerve. The response to FGF-2 upregulation was supported by our finding that FGF receptor-1 (FGFR-1) and heparan sulfate (HS), known to be essential for FGF-2 signaling, were expressed by adult rat RGCs. FGF-2 transgene expression led to only transient protection of injured RGCs. Thus the effect of this neurotrophic factor on axon extension could not be solely attributed to an increase in neuronal survival. Our data indicate that selective upregulation of FGF-2 in adult RGCs stimulates axon regrowth within the optic nerve, an environment that is highly inhibitory for regeneration. These results support the hypothesis that key factors involved in axon outgrowth during neural development may promote regeneration of adult injured neurons. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc.

Whether there is somatotopic organization within these fascicles has long been of interest, the subject of many investigations, and somewhat controversial. Evidence from diverse sources now points to important somatotopic clustering of nerve fibers within most of the length of the nerve. Information is lacking regarding proximal segments, particularly the plexus and spinal nerve root levels. As a result of this somatotopic arrangement, partial focal nerve lesions can produce restricted clinical deficits that defy the classic rules of localization. Examples of such restricted nerve lesions are provided in this review. Recognition of fascicle somatotopy is also important in the surgical approach to disorders of peripheral nerves.

We measured nasal airflow in human subjects while they imagined sights, sounds and smells, and only during olfactory imagery did subjects spontaneously enact the motor component of olfaction-that is, they sniffed. Moreover, as in perception(3,4), imagery of pleasant odors involved larger sniffs than imagery of unpleasant odors, suggesting that the act of sniffing has a functional role in creating of olfactory percepts.

There were no significant differences in either the magnitude E-max: 11.5 +/- 1.1% (controls) versus 10.2 +/- 2.2% (HE patients) or the efficacy EC50: 20.2 +/- 5.5 nM (controls) versus 17.7 +/- 6.2 nM (HE patients) of flunitrazepam modulation of [H-3]muscimol binding. Allopregnanolone also showed modulation of both sites to a comparable extent in brain tissue from cirrhotic patients and controls E-max: [H-3]muscimol, 15.1 +/- 2.8% (controls) versus 13.8 +/- 1.9% (HE patients); [H-3]flunitrazepam, 17.9 +/- 2.3% (controls) versus 19.1 +/- 2.3% (HE patients), EC50: [H-3]muscimol, 386.5 +/- 25.8 nM (controls) versus 373.8 +/- 13.1 nM (HE patients); [H-3]flunitrazepam, 49.8 +/- 22.9 nM (controls) versus 55.5 +/- 14.0 nM (HE patients). These findings demonstrate unequivocally that the GABA-A sites and their benzodiazepine and neurosteroid modulatory sites manifest normal allosteric coupling in brain in human HE. Therefore, if increased "GABAergic tone" is implicated in the pathophysiology of HE, this must be the consequence of increased brain concentrations of endogenous benzodiazepine and/or neurosteroid ligands for components of the GABA-A receptor complex rather than alterations of the receptor proteins themselves.

Twelve healthy, right-handed participants solved a total of 90 different TOL problems. They were scanned on four occasions during the fast learning stage as well as in a condition designed to control for internally guided movements. Practice of the TOL task resulted in a significant decrease in planning, execution, and total time taken to solve the problems. Consistent with the results of previous studies, early performance of the TOL task was associated with increased blood flow activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal, orbitofrontal, and parietal cortices on the left, as well as in the caudate nucleus, cerebellum, and premotor cortex, bilaterally. Interestingly, however, activity in the left caudate nucleus was maintained from the beginning to the end of the learning process, suggesting that this structure plays a role in this type of cognitive skill learning. In addition, correlational analyses revealed that improved performance on the TOL task was associated with a significant decrease of activity in the medial orbitofrontal and frontopolar cortices over the course of learning, areas thought to be involved in decision making, guessing, and monitoring of feedback information. In sum, the results lend further support to the idea that the learning of cognitive skills requiring planning and working memory capacities is mediated through a fronto-striatal network.

The sensitivity to electrolytic lesions of the VL-VM thalamic nuclei in rats was evaluated for tests requiring balance and equilibrium. VL-VM lesions impaired acquisition of the rotorod test but had no effect on stationary beam and hole-board tests. A selective impairment was also observed in the Morris water maze, as VL-VM thalamic lesions slowed down acquisition of the hidden platform but not the visible platform condition. These results support the hypothesis that thalamic motor nuclei participate in the acquisition of sensorimotor and spatial learning. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ireland Ltd and the Japan Neuroscience Society.

We, describe a patient with a recurrent CSF leak who was found at surgery to have an absence of the entire nerve root sleeve at multiple thoracic levels. CLINICAL PRESENTATION: A 29-year-old woman bodybuilder noted an excruciating orthostatic headache associated with nausea. The neurological examination was unremarkable, and a magnetic resonance imaging examination showed the typical changes of intracranial hypotension. Computed tomographic myelography showed an extensive bilateral lower cervical CSF leak. INTERVENTION: The patient underwent bilateral lower cervical nerve root explorations, and several small dural holes were found. The CSF leaks were repaired, but 3 months later, computed tomographic myelography showed a new CSF leak in the midthoracic area. A thoracic laminectomy was performed, and several nerve roots were found to be completely devoid of dura. After the CSF, leaks were repaired there. was significant improvement in her headaches. CONCLUSION: A recurrent spontaneous spinal CSF leak may occur in patients with intracranial hypotension at a site previously documented not to be associated with a CSF leak. Absent nerve root sleeves may be found in patients with spontaneous spinal CSF leaks ("nude nerve root" syndrome), and these patients may be at increased risk of developing a recurrent CSF leak.

We manipulated independently direction of attention and emotional state, using tasks involving heat pain and pleasant and unpleasant odors. Shifts in attention between the thermal and olfactory modalities did not alter mood or anxiety. Yet, when subjects focused attention on the pain, they perceived it as clearly more intense and somewhat more unpleasant than when they attended to the odor. In contrast, odor valence altered mood, anxiety level, and pain unpleasantness, but did not change the perception of pain intensity. Pain unpleasantness ratings correlated with mood, but not with odor valence, suggesting that emotional changes underlie the selective modulation of pain affect. These results show that emotion and attention differentially alter pain perception and thus invoke at least partially separable neural modulatory circuits.

To explore the suggested association between atypical neuroleptic use and the development of diabetes mellitus, with a focus on older adults. Design. Retrospective cohort study. Subjects. Eleven thousand one hundred four older (> 65 yrs) residents of long-term care institutions in Ontario, Canada, who received either atypical neuroleptic agents, typical neuroleptic agents, benzodiazepines, or corticosteroids. Measurements and Main Results. Each subject was followed for the development of a diabetic event, defined as newly prescribed antidiabetic drug therapy. Our Cox regression model was adjusted for age, sex, socioeconomic status, comorbidity, and concomitant use of beta-blockers, thiazide diuretics, and antiepileptic agents. The adjusted hazard ratio for the development of diabetes in patients receiving atypical neuroleptics compared with those receiving benzodiazepines (control group) was 0.89 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.66-1.21). The adjusted hazard ratio for typical neuroleptic users compared with the benzodiazepine group was 1.27 (95% CI 0.91-1.77). As expected, patients receiving corticosteroid therapy were almost twice as likely to develop diabetes as those receiving benzodiazepines (adjusted hazard ratio 2.2, 95% CI 1.41-3.12). For patients receiving atypical neuroleptic agents, no statistically significant difference in the percentage of diabetic events was found among individual agents (2.1% olanzapine, 1% quetiapine, 2.1% risperidone). Conclusion. Drug therapy with atypical neuroleptic agents in older adults did not increase their risk of developing diabetes mellitus.

These mutants were compared in a series of motor coordination tests requiring balance and equilibrium to nonataxic controls (Grid2(ho/+)) and to a double mutant (Grid2(ho/Lc)) with an inserted Lc mutation. The performance of Grid2(ho/ho) mutant mice was poorer than that of controls on stationary beam, coat hanger, unsteady platform, and rotorod tests. Grid2(ho/Lc) did not differ from Grid2(Lc/+) mice. However, the insertion of the Lc mutation in Grid2(ho/Lc) potentiated the deficits found in Grid2(ho/ho) in stationary beam, unsteady platform, and rotorod tests. These results indicate a deleterious effect of the Lc mutation on Grid2-deficient mice. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The plasma samples were fractionated by sequential affinity chromatography on heparin-agarose (HepA) and concanavalin A-agarose (ConA) columns followed by separation on one-dimensional and two-dimensional polyacrylamide gels. Carbonylation (oxidation) of proteins was monitored by in-strip derivatization with 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNP) and anti-DNP immunoblotting. Nine spots representing glycoproteins which showed enrichment or high specific oxidation indices in AD HepA-ConA 2-D gels relative to NEC samples were analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption-time of flight-mass spectrometry and identified with high probability (p < 0.001) as isoforms of human transferrin (Tf) hemopexin (Hpx) and alpha-1-antitrypsin (alpha-1-AT). These glycoproteins were concentrated, respectively, 5-, 6.5- and 107-fold in HepA-ConA eluates derived from AD plasma relative to the NEC samples. Specific oxidation indices of the identified Tf and Hpx isoforms in AD plasma were respectively, 7.4 and 2.8 relative to NEC. Our findings provide further evidence for systemic derangements in heme/iron/redox homeostasis and activation of the acute phase response in sporadic AD. Moreover, the data implicate isoforms of Tf, Hpx and alpha-1-AT as potential biological markers of this condition.

It was described as a GABA(B(1a,2)) receptor subtype-selective agonist, activating postsynaptic K+ currents and inhibiting postsynaptic Ca2+ channels in CA1 pyramidal cells, but without presynaptic actions. These activities appeared controversial and we therefore sought to further clarify gabapentin actions in rat hippocampal slices by characterizing K+ currents and Ca2+ channels targeted by gabapentin using whole-cell recording and multiphoton Ca2+ imaging. 1) We found that gabapentin and baclofen induced inwardly rectifying K+ currents (F-Gbp and K-Bac, respectively), sensitive to Ba2+ and Cs+. 2) A constitutively active K-IR current, independent of GABA(B) receptor activation and sensitive to Ba2+ and Cs+ was also present. 3) K-Gbp, K-Bac, and K-IR currents showed some differences in sensitivity to Ba2+ and Cs+, indicating the possible activation of distinct Kir3 currents, independent of KIR, by gabapentin and baclofen. 4) Gabapentin inhibition of Ca2+ channels was abolished by omega-conotoxin GVIA, but not by omega-agatoxin IVA and nimodipine, indicating a predominant action of gabapentin on N-type Ca2+ channels. 5) Gabapentin actions were linked to activation of pertussis toxin-sensitive G-proteins since N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) blocked K-Gbp activation and Ca2+ channel inhibition by gabapentin. 6) Finally, gabapentin reduced epileptiform discharges in slices via GABAB receptor activation. The anticonvulsant actions of gabapentin in hippocampal cells may thus involve GABAB receptor coupling to G-proteins and modulation of Kir3 and N-type Ca2+ channels. Moreover, gabapentin and baclofen activation of GABA(B) receptors may couple to distinct cellular targets. (C) 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Among them, organochlorine compounds (OCs) are known to affect calcium (Ca2+) homeostasis. They are neurotoxic by perturbation of Ca2+ channels and pumps, and they interfere with protein kinase C (PKC) and Ca2+ binding protein (CaBP). Ca2+ is an essential element to adequate fetal growth and development. The aim of the present study is to determine the relation between low environmental maternal exposure to OCs, such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB 153), Aroclor 1260, p,p'-dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and p,p'-dichlorodiphenyl-dichloroethane (DDE), Ca2+ levels in serum and placenta, placental Ca2+ transfer, and newborn development. Total Ca2+ and OCs were measured in women's serum samples, as well as in umbilical cord's serum and placenta at term. Placentas were taken for trophoblast cells isolation and Ca2+ incorporation kinetic experiments. Our results were obtained from 30 pregnant women from the southwestern area of Quebec. Concentrations of Aroclor 1260, PCB 153, DDE, and DDT were respectively 6.1, 6.0, 3.1, and 2.9 times lower in the umbilical cord serum than in the mother's serum at term. In the placenta, DDE was accumulated at higher levels than other contaminants. A tendency towards an inverse relation was observed for in OCs found in three compartments and Ca2+ levels in maternal serum and in placental tissues. Maternal Ca2+ concentrations do not influence Ca2+ uptake by syncytiotrophoblast. Only DDE (greater than or equal to0.70 mug/l) in maternal serum significantly was associated with a small increase in Ca2+ uptake by syncytiotrophoblast. This study will help us determine if low OC contamination significantly modifies Ca2+ transfer in syncytiotrophoblast.

We ask whether radial and rotational second-order (texture-defined) motion patterns are processed in a similar manner. The motion sensitivity to translating, radiating and rotating motion patterns of both first-order (luminance-modulated noise) and second-order (contrast-modulated noise) were measured for patterns presented at four different exposure durations (106, 240, 500 and 750 ms). No significant difference in motion sensitivity was found across motion type for the first-order motion class across exposure duration (i.e., from 240 to 750 ms) whereas direction-identification thresholds for radiating and rotating second-order motion were significantly greater than that of the second-order translational stimuli. Furthermore, thresholds to all second-order motion stimuli increased at a significantly faster rate with decreasing exposure duration compared to those of first-order motion. Interestingly, simple and complex second-order thresholds increased at similar rates. Taken together, the results suggest that complex second-order motion is not analyzed in a sequential manner. Rather, it seems that the same 'hard-wired' mechanisms responsible for complex first-order motion processing also mediate complex second-order motion, but not before the pre-processing (i.e., rectification) of local second-order motion signals.

Complex I is composed of at least 46 structural subunits that are encoded in both nuclear and mitochondrial DNA. Enzyme deficiency can result from either impaired catalytic efficiency or an inability to assemble the holoenzyme complex; however, the assembly process remains poorly understood. We have used two-dimensional Blue-Native/SDS gel electrophoresis and a panel of 11 antibodies directed against structural subunits of the enzyme to investigate complex I assembly in the muscle mitochondria from four patients with complex I deficiency caused by either mitochondrial or nuclear gene defects. Immunoblot analyses of second dimension denaturing gels identified seven distinct complex I subcomplexes in the patients studied, five of which could also be detected in non-denaturing gels in the first dimension. Although the abundance of these intermediates varied among the different patients, a common constellation of subcomplexes was observed in all cases. A similar profile of subcomplexes was present in a human/mouse hybrid fibroblast cell line with a severe complex I deficiency due to an almost complete lack of assembly of the holoenzyme complex. The finding that diverse causes of complex I deficiency produce a similar pattern of complex I subcomplexes suggests that these are intermediates in the assembly of the holoenzyme complex.

At CF - CA3 pyramidal neuron synapses, membrane depolarization paired with low (0.33 Hz) presynaptic stimulation generated a heterogeneous response that ranged from long-term potentiation (LTP), long-term depression (LTD), to no alteration of synaptic strength. However, the same induction paradigm applied at MF-CA3 pyramidal neuron synapses consistently induced LTD. This novel form of LTD was independent of NMDARs, mGluRs, cannabinoid receptors, opioid receptors, or coincident synaptic activity, but was dependent on postsynaptic Ca2+ elevation through L-type Ca2+ channels and release from inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor- sensitive intracellular stores. Ca2+ imaging of both proximal and distal CA3 pyramidal neuron dendrites demonstrated that the depolarizing induction paradigm differentially elevated intracellular Ca2+ levels. L-type Ca2+ channel activation was observed only at the most proximal locations where mossy fibers make synapses. Depolarization- induced LTD did not occlude the conventional 1 Hz-induced LTD or vice versa, suggesting independent mechanisms underlie each form of plasticity. The paired-pulse ratio and coefficient of variation of synaptic transmission were unchanged after LTD induction, suggesting that the expression locus of LTD is postsynaptic. Moreover, peak-scaled nonstationary variance analysis indicated that depolarization-induced LTD correlated with a reduction in postsynaptic AMPA receptor numbers without a change in AMPA receptor conductance. Our results suggest that this novel form of LTD is selectively expressed at proximal dendritic locations closely associated with L-type Ca2+ channels.

Relative to control values, the preterm group values showed a mean bilateral reduction in hippocampal volume of 8-9% (ranging to 23%), whereas the developmental amnesic group values showed a reduction of 40% (ranging from 27% to 56%). Despite equivalent IQ and immediate memory scores in the two study groups, there were marked differences between them on a wide variety of verbal and visual delayed memory tasks. Consistent with their diagnosis, the developmental amnesic group was impaired relative to both other groups on nearly all delayed memory measures. The preterm group, by contrast, was significantly impaired relative to the controls on only a few memory measures, i.e., route following and prospective memory. We suggest that early hippocampal pathology leads to the disabling memory impairments associated with developmental amnesia when the volume of this structure is reduced below normal by approximate to20-30% on each side. Whether this is a sufficient condition for the disorder or whether abnormality in other brain regions is also necessary remains to be determined.

In mouse and rat spinal cord, [I-125]-deltorphin-labeled DOR binding sites were detected throughout the gray matter. In contrast, in primate and particularly in human spinal cord, DOR binding was mainly present in laminae I-II, with little to no binding in deeper layers. Accordingly, in rodent spinal cord, DOR mRNA was expressed by a large number of neurons distributed throughout the ventral and dorsal horns, whereas in the primate, DOR expression was significantly lower, as evidenced by a moderate number of labeled cells throughout the gray matter in monkey and by only few labeled cells in human, mainly in Clarke's column and lamina IX. Major species differences in DOR expression were also observed in primary afferent cells bodies. In rat DRG, intense DOR mRNA hybridization was primarily observed over large ganglion cells immunopositive for neurofilament 200. In contrast, in monkey and human DRG, DOR mRNA was primarily detected over small and medium-sized ganglion cells. These results demonstrate major differences in the expression and distribution of DOR in the spinal cord and DRG between mammalian species. Specifically, they point to a progressive specialization of DOR toward the regulation of primary somatosensory, namely nociceptive, inputs during phylogeny and suggest that the effects of DOR agonists in rodents may not be entirely predictive of their action in humans.

( 2002) Science 298, 1781 - 1785). In this study, we investigated whether accumulation of prion protein ( PrP) in the cytosol is toxic to human neurons in primary culture. We show that in these neurons, a single PrP isoform lacking signal peptide accumulates in the cytosol of neurons treated with epoxomicin, a specific proteasome inhibitor. Therefore, endogenously expressed PrP is subject to the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway and is degraded by the proteasome in human primary neurons. In contrast to its toxicity in N2a cells, reverse-translocated PrP (ERAD-PrP) is not toxic even when neurons are microinjected with cDNA constructs to overexpress either wild-type PrP or mutant PrPD178N. We found that ERAD-PrP in human neurons remains detergent-soluble and proteinase K-sensitive, in contrast to its detergent-insoluble and proteinase K-resistant state in N2a cells. Furthermore, not only is microinjection of a cDNA construct expressing CyPrP not toxic, it protects these neurons against Bax-mediated cell death. We conclude that in human neurons, ERAD-PrP is not converted naturally into a form reminiscent of scrapie PrP and that PrP located in the cytosol retains its protective function against Bax. Thus, it is unlikely that simple accumulation of PrP in the cytosol can cause neurodegeneration in prion diseases.

The rate of Kv3.3 inactivation has, however, been difficult to establish given problems in obtaining consistent rates of inactivation in expression systems. This study characterized the properties of AptKv3.3, the teleost homologue of Kv3.3, when expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) or human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells. We show that the properties of AptKv3.3 differ significantly between CHO and HEK cells, with the largest difference occurring in the rate and voltage dependence of inactivation. While AptKv3.3 in CHO cells showed a fast and voltage-dependent rate of inactivation consistent with N-type inactivation, currents in HEK cells showed rates of inactivation that were voltage-independent and more consistent with a slower C-type inactivation. Examination of the mRNA sequence revealed that the first methionine start site had a weak Kozak consensus sequence, suggesting that the lack of inactivation in HEK cells could be due to translation at a second methionine start site downstream of the NH2-terminal coding region. Mutating the nucleotide sequence surrounding the first methionine start site to one more closely resembling a Kozak consensus sequence produced currents that inactivated with a fast and voltage-dependent rate of inactivation in both CHO and HEK cells. These results indicate that under the appropriate conditions Kv3.3 channels can exhibit fast and reliable inactivation that approaches that more typically expected of "A"-type K+ currents.

Intranuclear inclusions are the pathological hallmark of OPMD. The mechanism by which protein aggregation in OPMD might relate to a toxic gain-of-function has so far remained elusive. Whether protein aggregates themselves are pathogenic or are the consequence of an unidentified underlying molecular mechanism is still unclear. Here, we report that protein aggregation in a cell model of OPMD directly impaires the function of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (UPP) as well as molecular chaperone functions. The proteasome inhibitor lactacystin causes significant increase of protein aggregation and toxicity. Moreover, overexpression of molecular chaperones (HSP40 and HSP70) suppressed protein aggregation and toxicity. We also provide evidence that mPABPN1-ala17 protein aggregation proportionally correlates with toxicity. Furthermore, we show that co-expression of chaperones in our OPMD cell model increases the solubility of mPABPN1-ala17 and transfected cell survival rate. Our studies suggest that molecular regulators of polyalanine protein solubility and degradation may provide insights into new mechanisms in OPMD pathogenesis. Further analysis of the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which UPP and molecular chaperones influence the degradation of misfolded proteins could provide novel concepts and targets for the treatment and understanding of the pathogenesis of OPMD and neurodegenerative diseases.

Using a gene deletion approach, we generated mice containing only NF-L or NF-M. In vivo pulse radiolabeling analyses in retinal ganglion cell neurons revealed that NF-L alone is incapable of efficient transport, whereas nearly one-half of the normal level of NF-M is transported along optic axons in the absence of the other triplet subunits. Under these conditions, however, NF-M transport is completely abolished by deleting alpha-internexin. Our results strongly suggest that efficient neurofilament protein transport in vivo minimally requires hetero-oligomer formation. They also show that NF-M can partner with intermediate filament proteins other than the NF-H and NF-L subunits in neurons to support slow transport and possibly other functions of neuronal intermediate filaments.

It produces several alterations in organs, especially in the brain. Recently, isoflurane emerged in neuroscience laboratories. For many reasons it appears to be better than halothane for animal brain research (e.g. isoflurane induces lower intracranial pressure, and is less detrimental on the cardiovascular system). However, no one is in a position to recommend it in electrophysiology research because its effects on specific brain functions are relatively unknown. Given that both anesthetics yield different actions on gross brain activity (EEG, VEP), it is likely that they differentially affect single neuron activity. The goal of this study is to determine whether halothane or isoflurane use is best suited to study the receptive field properties of neurons in the cat's primary visual cortex. Extra-cellular recordings were made for both anesthetics in area 17 of adult cats under different levels of anesthesia. Results indicate that various cell parameters differ under halothane anesthesia when compared with isoflurane. The main difference between the two anesthetics is the greater depression of the cell optimal visual response amplitude induced by isoflurane at equipotent concentration. Due to its stronger depressive effects, isoflurane may not be the ideal anesthetic for single-cell recordings in the primary visual cortex. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Recently, we have shown that CXCL8 can acutely modulate ion channel activity in septal neurons expressing receptors CXCR1 and/or CXCR2. This was a surprising finding, insofar as CXCR1 expression had not been described for the mammalian brain. Here we investigated whether CXCR1 transcripts are present in other brain regions, whether they are expressed at the single-cell level in molecularly identified neurons and astrocytes, and how they are regulated during early postnatal development. In addition, possible cellular colocalization of CXCR1 and CXCR2 transcripts was examined. Semiquantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) revealed that CXCR1 mRNAs were expressed in the septum, striatum, hippocampus, cerebellum, and cortex (temporoparietal and entorhinal) at different levels and appeared to be regulated independently from CXCR2 during development. By using RT multiplex PCR on acutely dissociated cells from these brain regions, we show that CXCR1 transcripts were expressed in 83% of 84 sampled neurons displaying cholinergic (choline acetyltransferase mRNAs), gamma-aminobutyric acidergic (glutamic acid decarboxylases 65 and 67 mRNAs), or glutamatergic (vesicular glutamate transporters 1 and 2 mRNAs) phenotypes. CXCR1 and CXCR2 transcripts were colocalized in 45% of neurons sampled and also were present in some glial fibrillary acidic protein mRNA-expressing astrocytes. This is the first study to demonstrate the widespread expression of CXCR1 transcripts in the brain and suggests that CXCR1 may have hitherto unsuspected roles in neuromodulation and inflammation.

Across populations, impulsivity has been linked to reduced 5-HT activity, but compulsivity has been associated (at least inconsistently) with an increase. We therefore became interested in the association between behavioral-trait variations and 5-HT status in BN. In 56 bulimic and 29 non-bulimic women, we measured eating symptoms, personality traits, platelet paroxetine binding, and neuroendocrine responses following oral meta-chlorophenylpiperazine (m-CPP). Relative to normal eaters, bulimic women showed reduced density (B-max) of platelet paroxetine-binding sites, blunted prolactin (PRL) responses following m-CPP, and (as a trend) lower basal PRL levels. However, after effects of binge-purge frequencies, body mass, and other extraneous factors were controlled, PRL levels at baseline and other moments in the serial sampling varied systematically with presence of impulsive and compulsive traits. PRL was generally low in BN, but 'high-compulsive'/'low-impulsive' traits were associated with higher (normal-range) PRL values. Comparable trait-related variations were not observed on paroxetine-binding indices. Our findings suggest that 5-HT status in BN may correspond to impulsive or compulsive traits, and they encourage multidimensional modeling of the pathophysiological role of 5-HT in BN.

J	Clarfield, AM				Clarfield, AM			The decreasing prevalence of reversible dementias - An updated meta-analysis	ARCHIVES OF INTERNAL MEDICINE			English	Review							PROGRESSIVE INTELLECTUAL DETERIORATION; CLINICAL-PREDICTION RULES; ACADEMY-OF-NEUROLOGY; IMAGING PROCEDURE CT; COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; ELDERLY OUTPATIENTS; VITAMIN-B12 DEFICIENCY; DIAGNOSTIC EVALUATION; CONSECUTIVE PATIENTS	Background: In 1988, 2 meta-analyses suggested that the prevalence of reversible dementia was significantly lower than had been previously estimated. it was predicted that further work would indicate an. even lower rate. The present study represents an updated meta-analysis of the true prevalence of reversible dementia. Methods: MEDLINE was searched from 1987 through 2002. References were also gleaned from pertinent articles and relevant textbooks. Data were extracted on the nature and provenance of the studies, dementia etiology, and the proportion of cases that were potentially reversible and reversed. Results: Fifty articles were identified of which 39 met the study criteria, representing 7042 patients of whom 5620 (87.2%) had dementia. Patients were classified according to etiology and, where possible (in 23 [59%] of 39 studies), whether the dementia partially or completely resolved. A much higher proportion of studies than was previously the case were either community-based (31%) or observed subjects from outpatient departments (54%). Alzheimer disease was still the commonest cause of dementia (56.3%) followed by a vascular etiology (20.3%). Conditions requiring neuroimaging made up only 2.2% of cases. Potentially reversible causes were seen in 9%, and only 0.6% of dementia cases actually reversed (0.29% partially, 0.31% fully). Conclusions: The reported proportion of dementias that reverse is much lower than previously thought. While comorbidity should always be treated for its own sake and in the hope that cognitive decline may at least be delayed, the present findings have significant clinical and economic implications for the workup of dementia.

In order to assess receptor dependence of these events, we used PC12 cell cultures, which are devoid of TGF-beta receptors. Surprisingly, TGF-beta potentiated the neurotoxic effects of the 40-residue Abeta peptide, Abeta-(1 - 40), in this model suggesting that there may be a direct, receptor-independent interaction between TGF-beta and Abeta- (1 - 40). Surface plasmon resonance confirmed that TGF-beta binds with high affinity directly to Abeta- (1 - 40) and electron microscopy revealed that TGF-beta enhances Abeta- (1 - 40) oligomerization. Immunohistochemical examination of mouse brain revealed that hippocampal CA1 and dentate gyrus, two regions classically associated with Abeta- mediated pathology, lack TGF-beta Type I receptor immunoreactivity, thus indicating that TGF-beta receptor-mediated signaling would not be favored in these regions. Our observations not only provide for a unique, receptor-independent mechanism of action for TGF-beta, but also help to reconcile the literature interpreting the role of TGF-beta in Abeta function. These data support a critical etiological role for this mechanism in neuropathological amyloidoses.

In contrast to its receptor-mediated endocytosis at neutral pH, addition of 25 mug/ml of either Alexa 568- or FITC-conjugated PGI to NIH-3T3 cells at progressively acid pH results in its quantitatively increased association with cell surface fibrillar structures that is particularly evident at pH 5. A similar pH-dependent cell surface association of PGI is observed for first passage human chondrocytes obtained from osteoarthritic joints. At acid pH, PGI colocalizes with fibronectin fibrils, and this association occurs directly upon addition of PGI to the cells. In contrast to the receptor-mediated endocytosis of PGI, fibril association of 25 mug/ml PGI at pH 5 is not competed with an excess (2 mg/ml) of unlabeled PGI. PGI binding at acid pH is therefore neither saturable nor mediated by its receptor. PGI is enzymatically active as a dimer and we show here by non-denaturing gel electrophoresis as well as by glutaraldehyde cross-linking that it exists at neutral pH in a tetrameric form. Increasingly acid pH results in the appearance of PGI monomers that correlates directly with its enhanced cell surface association. However, glutaraldehyde cross-linked PGI is endocytosed at neutral pH and still exhibits enhanced cell surface binding at pH 5. Circular dichroism analysis revealed pH-dependent changes in the near but not the far UV spectra indicating that the tertiary structure of the protein is specifically altered at pH 5. Conformational changes of PGI and exposure of the monomer-monomer interface under acidic conditions, such as those encountered in the synovial fluid of arthritic joints, could therefore result in its deposition on the surface of joints and the induction of an autoimmune response.

This raised the question of whether the abnormalities seen in Crtl1 null mice are all caused by the absence of link protein in cartilage or whether the deficiency of the protein in other tissues and organs contributed to the phenotype. To address this question we have generated transgenic mice overexpressing cartilage link protein under the control of a cartilage-specific promoter, and then these transgenic mice were used for a genetic rescue of abnormalities in Crtl1 null mice. While the overexpression of cartilage link protein resulted in no abnormal phenotype, the cartilage-specific transgene expression of link protein could completely prevent the perinatal mortality of link protein-deficient mice and, depending on the level of the link protein expression, rescue skeletal abnormalities. Although link protein was originally isolated from cartilage, we found and determined Crtl1 transcripts and corresponding proteins in every organ tested from mouse embryos to aging animals. We also identified three additional members of the link protein family, all co-localized with hyaluronic acid-binding proteoglycans in the mouse genome. The ubiquitous presence of link protein suggests a general and systemic function of link protein in the organization of extracellular matrix in a number of tissues, possibly interacting with other proteoglycans, such as versican, brevican, and neurocan.

In chimeric mice that are mixtures of normal and SOD1 mutant-expressing cells, toxicity to motor neurons is shown to require damage from mutant SOD1 acting within nonneuronal cells. Normal motor neurons in SOD1 mutant chimeras develop aspects of ALS pathology. Most important, nonneuronal cells that do not express mutant SOD1 delay degeneration and significantly extend survival of mutant-expressing motor neurons.

This finding has been attributed to a process of leaky integration. However, the rate at which integration approaches asymptote has been shown to depend on stimulation strength, a finding that differs from the behavior of a simple leaky integrator. The authors replicate both findings and show that they are both well described by a new model that incorporates a hyperbolic strength-duration function, a logistic function mapping stimulation frequency onto reward intensity, and another logistic function mapping reward intensity onto performance.

J	Aristizabal, F; Glavinovic, MI				Aristizabal, F; Glavinovic, MI			Wavelet analysis of nonstationary fluctuations of Monte Carlo-simulated excitatory postsynaptic currents	BIOPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article							GLUTAMATE-RECEPTOR CHANNELS; SODIUM CURRENT FLUCTUATIONS; CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; SYNAPTIC TRANSMISSION; TRANSMITTER CONCENTRATION; CONDUCTANCE FLUCTUATIONS; NEUROTRANSMITTER RELEASE; NEUROMUSCULAR-JUNCTION; HIPPOCAMPAL SYNAPSES; KAINATE RECEPTORS	Tracking spectral changes of rapidly varying signals is a demanding task. In this study, we explore on Monte Carlo-simulated glutamate-activated AMPA patch and synaptic currents whether a wavelet analysis offers such a possibility. Unlike Fourier methods that determine only the frequency content of a signal, the wavelet analysis determines both the frequency and the time. This is owing to the nature of the basis functions, which are infinite for Fourier transforms (sines and cosines are infinite), but are finite for wavelet analysis (wavelets are localized waves). In agreement with previous reports, the frequency of the stationary patch current fluctuations is higher for larger currents, whereas the mean-variance plots are parabolic. The spectra of the current fluctuations and mean-variance plots are close to the theoretically predicted values. The median frequency of the synaptic and nonstationary patch currents is, however, time dependent, though at the peak of synaptic currents, the median frequency is insensitive to the number of glutamate molecules released. Such time dependence demonstrates that the "composite spectra" of the current fluctuations gathered over the whole duration of synaptic currents cannot be used to assess the mean open time or effective mean open time of AMPA channels. The current (patch or synaptic) versus median frequency plots show hysteresis. The median frequency is thus not a simple reflection of the overall receptor saturation levels and is greater during the rise phase for the same saturation level. The hysteresis is due to the higher occupancy of the doubly bound state during the rise phase and not due to the spatial spread of the saturation disk, which remains remarkably constant. Albeit time dependent, the variance of the synaptic and nonstationary patch currents can be accurately determined. Nevertheless the evaluation of the number of AMPA channels and their single current from the mean-variance plots of patch or synaptic currents is not highly accurate owing to the varying number of the activatable AMPA channels caused by desensitization. The spatial nonuniformity of open, bound, and desensitized AMPA channels, and the time dependence and spatial nonuniformity of the glutamate concentration in the synaptic cleft, further reduce the accuracy of stimates of the number of AMPA channels from synaptic currents. In conclusion, wavelet analysis of nonstationary fluctuations of patch and synaptic currents expands our ability to determine accurately the variance and frequency of current fluctuations, demonstrates the limits of applicability of techniques currently used to evaluate the single channel current and number of AMPA channels, and offers new insights into the mechanisms involved in the generation of unitary quantal events at excitatory central synapses.

J	Hemmerling, TM; Donati, F				Hemmerling, TM; Donati, F			Neuromuscular blockade at the larynx, the diaphragm and the corrugator supercilii muscle: a review	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ANAESTHESIA-JOURNAL CANADIEN D ANESTHESIE			English	Article							ADDUCTOR POLLICIS MUSCLES; PHRENIC-NERVE STIMULATION; CERVICAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; GOOD INTUBATING CONDITIONS; ORBICULARIS OCULI; TRACHEAL INTUBATION; BLOOD-FLOW; ANESTHETIZED HUMANS; CONSCIOUS HUMANS; RECORDING SITE	Purpose: To review recent findings concerning neuromuscular blockade and monitoring at the larynx, the diaphragm, and the corrugator supercilii muscle. Source: This narrative review is based on recent publications. Principal findings: Neuromuscular blockade at the larynx and the diaphragm is less intense than at, the adductor pollicis muscle; the onset and offset of neuromuscular blockade is more rapid. The corrugator supercilii muscle reflects better the time course of neuromuscular blockade of the larynx than the adductor pollicis muscle, is better suited to monitor the onset of neuromuscular blockade for intubation, and should give a better reflection of the time course and degree of neuromuscular blockade of the larynx or the diaphragm. Recovery of neuromuscular function at the end of any procedure is best reflected at the adductor pollicis muscle where neuromuscular transmission is last restored. Clinical monitoring of the larynx or the diaphragm is still limited by the absence of a simple method. Acceleromyography of the corrugator supercilii muscle is prone to artifacts that do not occur during monitoring of the adductor pollicis muscle. Phonomyography, a new method of monitoring that is currently being tested, is based on the phenomenon that muscle contraction creates low-frequency sound waves, which can be detected using special microphones to quantify neuromuscular blockade. This method seems promising because it can be easily used on all muscles of interest. Conclusion: Research during the last 15 years has greatly enhanced our knowledge about how muscles react differently to muscle relaxants and has enabled us to achieve better surgical conditions with safer use of muscle relaxants. Interesting technologies have been developed to reliably monitor neuromuscular blockade at the larynx and the diaphragm, but are currently restricted to research settings. Our increased understanding should help us in ongoing efforts to develop the "ideal" muscle relaxant and the "ideal" method of neuromuscular monitoring.

In order to establish the functional role for zincergic neurons in visual cortical function and plasticity we have compared the topographic distribution of zincergic terminals in the primary visual cortex (V1) of normal adult vervet monkeys (Cercopithicus aethiops) to that in monkeys monocularly deprived of visual input for short (24 h) or long (3 months) survival times. In normal animals, staining levels for zinc were highest in layers 1-3, 4b, 5 and 6 and lowest in layers 4a and 4c. The laminar and tangential patterns of zinc staining were complementary to staining patterns demonstrated using cytochrome oxidase (CO) histochemistry. Following 3 months of monocular deprivation by enucleation, levels of zinc staining in layers 3, 4calpha and 6a were heterogeneously reduced, clearly revealing the ocular dominance pattern in V1. When compared with the pattern of CO staining, levels of both CO and zinc were reduced in cortical territory innervated by the enucleated eye. Zinc histochemistry also revealed the ocular dominance pattern after only 24 h of monocular impulse blockade induced by enucleation or intravitreal tetrodotoxin infusion. However, by either means of deprivation for 24 h, levels of zinc were increased in deprived-eye stripes relative to nondeprived-eye stripes. These results indicate that zincergic terminals demarcate distinct compartments in the primate visual cortex. Furthermore, levels of synaptic zinc are rapidly and dynamically regulated, suggesting that zinc and/or zincergic neurons participate in mediating activity-dependent changes in the organization of the adult neocortex.

Materials and methods: The literature was searched for randomised controlled trials that dealt with the management of brain metastases. Potential research questions were identified on the basis of the results of the literature review. Results: A number of research questions were identified. In the context of the NCIC Symptom Control Group, a trial of supportive care alone vs supportive care and whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT) in a subset of patients with the diagnosis of brain metastases was deemed to be of highest priority. We discussed a number of issues relating to the feasibility of such a trial. Conclusions: The optimal management of brain metastases remains elusive. Despite the results of numerous randomised controlled trials, many questions remain unanswered. The magnitude of benefit using WBRT above supportive care alone is uncertain. A trial of supportive care alone vs supportive care and WBRT may be successful once target population, feasibility and methodological issues are thoroughly solved.

J	Gagne, F; Blaise, C				Gagne, F; Blaise, C			Effects of municipal effluents on serotonin and dopamine levels in the freshwater mussel Elliptio complanata	COMPARATIVE BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY C-TOXICOLOGY & PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						endocrine disruption; transfected serotonin receptors; estrogen; nonylphenol; monoamine oxidase; nerve ganglia; gonad; molluscs	DREISSENA-POLYMORPHA; CRASSOSTREA-GIGAS; ZEBRA MUSSEL; GONADAL-STEROIDS; BRAIN; CATECHOLAMINES; HEPATOCYTES; TILAPIA; OYSTER	Sex differentiation and gametogenesis represent critical steps in the reproductive process and are subject to hormonal control by serotonin, dopamine and steroids such as estradiol-17beta and testosterone. The purpose of this study sought to examine the endocrine-disrupting activity that a primary-treated municipal effluent might have on the metabolism of biogenic amine levels. First, serotonin receptors transfected in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were used to screen for the presence of serotonin receptor agonist or antagonist. Second, one group of Elliptio complanata mussels were exposed to single compounds likely to be found in municipal wastewaters and another group was exposed in situ to the municipal effluent plume for 90 days in experimental cages. Results showed that solid phase C-8 extracts of surface water downstream a municipal effluent could activate the transport of serotonin by receptors at a distance of at least 5 km from its outfall thereby indicating the presence of serotonin mimics in the effluent dispersion plume. Levels of serotonin and monoamine oxidase (MAO) activity in nerve ganglia of mussels exposed for 90 days to the municipal effluent were, respectively, reduced and increased at a distance 10-km downstream. Injections of estradiol-17beta and nonylphenol in mussels decreased the levels of serotonin and dopamine, but increased MAO activity in the gonad and nerve ganglia. Exposure to estrogenic chemicals present in municipal effluents may therefore alter the normal metabolism of serotonin and dopamine, both of which are involved in sexual differentiation in bivalves and fish. Chemicals acting through E2 receptor-mediated pathways and serotonin receptors are likely to cause the observed effects. Crown Copyright (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier Science Inc.

Studies of post-mortem brain tissue samples from individuals with AIDS have revealed that a small proportion of astrocytes are infected by HIV-1 which is linked to the development of HIV-associated dementia (HIVD), a frequent clinical manifestation of HIV-1 disease affecting up to 20% of infected adults. However, astrocyte infection by HIV-1 in vivo is generally non-productive, and can only be readily detected by sensitive techniques that detect HIV-1 RNA or proviral DNA. Similarly, primary astrocyte cultures and astrocytic cell lines can be permissive to infection by HIV-I strains, but are refractory to efficient HIV-1 expression. In efforts to delineate the molecular mechanisms underlying the "restricted" infection, several studies have demonstrated that efficient HIV-1 replication is blocked in astrocytes at different steps of the virus life cycle, including virus entry, reverse transcription, nucleocytoplasmic HIV-1 RNA transport, translation of viral RNA, and maturation of progeny virions. However, the relative importance of each of these possible replication blocks in restricting HIV-1 replication in astrocytes is unclear. Moreover, how restricted astrocyte infection contributes to the development of HIVD is unknown. This review surveys the current in vitro models of restricted HIV-1 replication in astrocytes, and provides an analysis of the available evidence supporting a role for astrocyte infection in the pathogenesis of HIVD. A greater understanding of the fate of HIV-1 in astrocytes may assist in the identification of viral reservoirs in the central nervous system, novel therapies for the treatment of HIVD, and also novel strategies to suppress HIV-1 replication in CD4(+) cells of the immune system.

J	Dray, A				Dray, Andy			Novel molecular targets in pain control	CURRENT OPINION IN ANESTHESIOLOGY			English	Article						pain; GPCRs; ion channels; enzymes; analgesia		Purpose of review The complexity of pain processing in clinical pain conditions and in animal models has revealed many time-related changes and an abundance of molecular drug targets. There continues to be insecurity, however, about new target validation in clinical pain and thus most analgesia development is of high risk for evolving new pain therapies. The present review highlights a number of molecular targets being pursued for pain control. Recent findings Many pain targets are critically dependent on the pain model/lesion type. Neural and glial plasticity, ranging from changes in molecular expression and receptor phosphorylation to profound morphological reorganization, has been described under these conditions. Pain modulation has been shown to involve all major families of regulatory proteins such as the G-protein coupled receptors, ion channels, regulatory enzymes, neurotrophins, and kinases, offering an abundance of targets and therapeutic opportunities for symptomatic pain relief. Summary Many molecular targets have been highlighted with some being the focus of current analgesia research. Some of these (e. g. vanilloid receptor 1, cannabinoid receptor 1, sodium channel NaV 1.8) have been evaluated in animal studies and in preliminary clinical studies, but others are highly novel and riskier analgesia pain targets (e. g. metabotropic glutamate receptors, sensory neurone specific receptors, kinase inhibitors).

Methods and results Four hundred and twenty-six of 768 patients receiving C, E, or C+E were randomized to either M or placebo. Patients were New York Heart Association class II-IV, ejection fraction (EF) <0.40 and 6-min walk distance <500 m. Ejection fraction (EF), cardiac volumes, blood pressures, heart rates, and neurohormones were measured. End diastolic volumes changed +29.4+/-6.4 ml for C/E, +16.6+/-10.4ml for C+E, +19.7+/-6.5ml for C+M/E+M, and -6.4+/-7.5ml for C+E+M (Pless than or equal to0.01). End systolic volumes changed +22.9+/-5.8 ml for C/E, +11.9+/-9.1 mt for C+E, +6.0+/-5.7 ml for C+E/E+M, and -16.5+/-7.0 mL for C+E+M (Pless than or equal to0.001). Ejection fraction changed +0.01+/-0.01 for C/E, +0.01+/-0.01 for C+E, +0.03+/-0.01 for C+M/E+M, and +0.05+/-0.01 for C+E+M (Pless than or equal to0.0001). No significant differences for blood pressure or neurohormones; heart rate for C+M/E+M and C+E+M decreased (Pless than or equal to0.01) vs C/E or C+E. Conclusion C+E+M had a modest but beneficial effect on cardiac function compared to the other groups. Combination of C+E+M has potential for providing HF patients with further benefit.

Recently, to minimise the extent of surgery, anterior interbody fusion with cages has become more common. While there are numerous reports on the primary stabilising effects of the different cervical cages, little is known about the subsidence behaviour of such cages in vivo. We retrospectively reviewed eight patients with cervical radiculopathy operated upon with anterior discectomy and fusion with a stand-alone titanium cervical cage. During surgery, only the cartilage portion of the end plate was removed and the cages were filled with autologous cancellous bone graft from the iliac crest. To assess possible subsidence or migration, three different radiographic measurements in the sagittal plane were taken for each case, postoperatively and at the latest follow-up. Subsidence was defined as any change in at least one of our parameters of at least 3 mm. Follow-up time was 12-18 months (average 15 months). Five of the nine fused levels had radiological signs of cage subsidence. No posterior or anterior migration was observed. However, subsidence did not correlate with clinical symptoms in four of the five patients. The remaining patient with signs of subsidence, whose neck pain and neurologic symptoms had regressed in the early postoperative course, suffered recurrence of radiculopathy 6 months after the surgery. Her symptoms were explained by the subsidence of the cage and the subsequent foraminal stenosis observed on the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. At 15 months' follow-up, her cage was broken. Our preliminary results, so far limited in number, represent a serious warning to the proponents of stand-alone cervical cages	McGill Univ, Jewish Gen Hosp, Dept Orthoped Surg, Montreal, PQ H3T 1E2, Canada; McGill Univ, Montreal, PQ, Canada; Dept Surg, Lausanne, Switzerland	Arlet, V (reprint author), McGill Univ, Jewish Gen Hosp, Dept Orthoped Surg, 3755 Chemin Cote St Catherine, Montreal, PQ H3T 1E2, Canada.							16	104	120	0	6	SPRINGER-VERLAG	NEW YORK	175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA	0940-6719			EUR SPINE J	Eur.

Although many computer-assisted systems have been developed to optimize pedicle screw insertion, these systems are expensive, not user-friendly and involve significant radiation from pre-operative computed tomographic (CT) scan imaging. This study describes and evaluates a transpedicular drill guide (TDG) designed to assist in the proper placement of pedicle screws in the thoracic spine. Pilot holes were made manually using the TDG in the thoracic spine (T1-T11) of three human cadavers before inserting 4.5-mm-diameter screws. CT scans followed by visual inspection of the spines were performed to evaluate the position of the screws. Five of 66 screws (7.6%) violated the pedicle wall: two (3.0%) medially and three (4.5%) laterally. The medial and lateral perforations were within 1 mm and 2 mm of the pedicle wall, respectively. The medial perforations were not at risk of causing neurological complications. No screw penetrated the superior or inferior pedicle wall. The TDG is easy to use and can decrease the incidence of misplaced thoracic pedicle screws. The TDG could be used as a complement to fluoroscopy in certain applications, especially for training surgeons.

Recently, an increasing number of medical reports have implicated osteoporotic fractures as a cause of serious neurological deficit and painful disabling spinal deformities. This has been corroborated by the present authors as well. These complications are only amenable to surgical management, requiring instrumentation. Instrumenting an osteoporotic spine, although a challenging task, can be accomplished if certain guidelines for surgical techniques are respected. Neurological deficits respond equally well to an anterior or posterior decompression, provided this is coupled with multisegmental fixation of the construct. With the steady increase in the elderly population, it is anticipated that the spine surgeon will face serious complications of osteoporotic spines more frequently. With regard to surgery, however, excellent correction of deformities can be achieved, by combining anterior and posterior approaches. Paget's disease of bone (PD) is a non-hormonal osteometabolic disorder and the spine is the second most commonly affected site. About one-third of patients with spinal involvement exhibit symptoms of clinical stenosis. In only 12-24% of patients with PD of the spine is back pain attributed solely to PD, while in the majority of patients, back pain is either arthritic in nature or a combination of a pagetic process and coexisting arthritis. In this context, one must be certain before attributing low back pain to PD exclusively, and antipagetic medical treatment alone may be ineffective. Neural element dysfunction may be attributed to compressive myelopathy by pagetic bone overgrowth, pagetic intraspinal soft tissue overgrowth, ossification of epidural fat, platybasia, spontaneous bleeding, sarcomatous degeneration and vertebral fracture or subluxation. Neural dysfunction can also result from spinal ischemia when blood is diverted by the so-called "arterial steal syndrome". Because the effectiveness of pharmacologic treatment for pagetic spinal stenosis has been clearly demonstrated, surgical decompression should only be instituted after failure of antipagetic medical treatment. Surgery is indicated as a primary treatment when neural compression is secondary to pathologic fractures, dislocations, spontaneous epidural hematoma, syringomyelia, platybasia, or sarcomatous transformation. Five classes of drugs are available for the treatment of PD. Bisphosphonates are the most popular antipagetic drug and several forms have been investigated.

Nicotine (50 muM) enhanced the evoked field potentials; its effects were also observed in the presence of the GABA(B) antagonist 2-hydroxy-saclofen (250 muM; added to BMI) and were blocked by pre-perfusion with the nicotinic antagonist hexamethonium (HXM, 50 muM). The potentiating effects of nicotine in BMI persisted during prolonged perfusion (more than 20 min), while those in control perfusion medium were transient. The nicotinic antagonists HXM (50 muM), methyllycaconitine (MLA, 0.01 muM) and dihydro-beta-erythroidine (DHbetaE, 50 muM) potentiated CA3-evoked field potentials. Perfusion of HXM in the presence of the anticholinesterase eserine (1 muM) or the muscarinic antagonist atropine (1 muM) did not alter its effects. None of the nicotinic agents tested changed the frequency of spontaneous BMI-induced epileptiform discharges (nicotine, HXM, MLA, DhbetaE), suggesting that nicotinic receptors do not drive spontaneous epileptiform discharges in this in vitro model. These experiments demonstrate that nicotinic receptors are activated tonically during disinhibition and modulate the activity of excitatory synapses in the immature CA3 hippocampal area. The persistent nicotinic facilitatory effects during disinhibition versus the transient in control conditions indicate that nicotinic modulation depends on environmental conditions and also that nicotinic receptors may be a contributing factor in early-life seizures.

Among the factors influencing degenerative processes during aging are altered levels of neurotrophic ovarian steroid 17beta-estradiol (E2). The follitropin receptor knockout (FORKO) female mouse displays hormonal imbalance characterized by very low levels of circulating E2 and high levels of testosterone. FORKO mice (24 days and 20 months) were used to investigate structural and functional changes in the central nervous system. We now show that the lifelong depletion of the sex hormone E2 in female FORKO mice correlates with abnormal behavior associated with defined alterations in brain morphology early in life, especially in aged animals. Immunohistochemical studies showed significant increases in the size and number of immunoreactive glial fibrillary acidic protein glial cells found in several brain regions (cortex and hippocampus) and a dramatic decline in estrogen receptors alpha and beta in the amygdala of FORKO females. These changes were associated with increased signs of anxiety in these animals. In the present study, we provide evidence that the chronic depletion of sex hormone E2 from early development leads to neural impairments in adult and aged FORKO mice that are associated with hypertrophy of glial cells, cell loss in distinct brain regions, and abnormal behavior. We suggest that the hormonal imbalance found in the female FORKO mouse provides an experimental paradigm for the study of morphological correlates of the behavioral changes that often accompany menopause in women.

Background.-The relationship between migraine and mood disorders has been of long-standing interest to researchers and clinicians. Although a strong association has been demonstrated consistently for migraine and major depression, there has been less systematic research on the links between migraine and bipolar disorder. Methods.-A migraine questionnaire (based on International Headache Society criteria) was administered to 108 outpatients with bipolar disorder. Information on the clinical course of bipolar illness was also collected. Results.-The overall lifetime prevalence of migraine was 39.8% (43.8% among women and 31.4% among men). In the subgroup of patients with bipolar II disorder, the lifetime prevalence of migraine was 64.7%. The bipolar with migraine group was younger, tended to be more educated, was more likely to be employed or studying, and had fewer psychiatric hospitalizations. Their initial presentation for psychiatric treatment was more often for symptoms of depression, rather than hypomania or mania. They were more likely to have a family history of migraine and psychiatric disorders, and a greater number of affected relatives. They were less likely to use mood stabilizers, and more likely to use atypical antidepressants. Migraine was assessed by a neurologist in only 16% of affected patients. The prevalence of the use of specific antimigraine medications (triptans) was 27.9%. Conclusions.-This study confirms the higher prevalence of migraine among those with bipolar disorder compared to the general population. Migraine in patients with bipolar disorder is underdiagnosed and undertreated. Bipolar disorder with migraine is associated with differences in the clinical course of bipolar disorder, and may represent a subtype of bipolar disorder.

J	Ong, CHP; Bateman, A				Ong, CHP; Bateman, A			Progranulin (Granulin-epithelin precursor, PC-cell derived growth factor, Acrogranin) in proliferation and tumorigenesis	HISTOLOGY AND HISTOPATHOLOGY			English	Review						progranulin; proliferation; tumorigenesis	LEUKOCYTE PROTEASE INHIBITOR; HUMAN-BREAST-CANCER; DIFFERENTIAL GENE-EXPRESSION; NEONATAL RAT HYPOTHALAMUS; STEROID-INDUCIBLE GENE; ACUTE MYELOID-LEUKEMIA; ARREST-SPECIFIC GENE; GRANULIN/EPITHELIN PRECURSOR; MICROARRAY ANALYSIS; HUMAN NEUTROPHILS	The granulin-epithelin precursor, progranulin, PC-cell-derived growth factor or acrogranin, is a high molecular weight secreted mitogen. It is abundantly expressed in rapidly cycling epithelial cells, in the immune system and in neurons, such as cerebellar Purkinje cells. Progranulin contributes to tumorigenesis in diverse cancers, including breast cancer, clear cell renal carcinoma, invasive ovarian carcinoma and glioblastoma. It regulates the rate of epithelial cell division in responsive epithelial cells, and confers an invasive phenotype on these cells. It is involved in the wound response. During embryogenesis, progranulin accelerates blastocyst formation, and is a growth factor for trophectodermal cells. In the neonate, progranulin, regulates the hormone-dependent virilization of the hypothalamus. It activates phosphorylation of She, and p44/42 MAPK (mitogen activated protein kinase) in the ERK (extracellular regulated kinase) signaling pathway; PI3K (phosophatidyl inositol-3-kinase), AKT/protein kinase B, and p70(S6kinase), in the phosophatidyl inositol-3-kinase pathway; and focal adhesion kinase in the adhesion/motility pathway. The signaling properties of progranulin are apparently similar to those of classic growth factors, but the functional properties of progranulin distinguish it from these molecules. Deleting the insulin-like growth factor I receptor from murine embryonic fibroblasts blocks proliferation in response to all classic growth factors, such as epidermal growth factor, or platelet-derived growth factor, whereas progranulin retains mitotic activity on these cells. The defined biological actions of progranulin probably represent a small fraction of its overall functions. Transcriptome analyses show that the progranulin gene is induced in numerous situations that vary from obesity to the transcriptional response of cells to antineoplastic drugs. Here, the biological roles of progranulin will be reviewed, with an emphasis on cancer and cell proliferation.

Methods The PCL is a simple cognitive test with 32 items that includes two scores of orientation and memory and a global score of 0-32 points. It was applied to a population sample of 527 elderly people over 70 with low educational level, who Were independently diagnosed by consensus between two neurologists as having normal cognitive function, age associated cognitive decline (AACD, IPA-OMS criteria) or dementia (DSM-IV criteria). Individuals with severe visual or hearing defects and those who rejected the exam were excluded from the study. The PCL was validated in a sample of 375 individuals: 300 normal, 42 with AACD and 33 with dementia. The sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and likelihood ratios, as well as the ROC curves for dementia and for AACD-dementia, were calculated. The confounding effect of sociodemographic variables was assessed by logistic regression analysis and convergent validity by partial correlations of the PCL with other cognitive tests. Inter-rater reliability was evaluated with the intraclass correlation coefficient. Results The PCL identified dementia (cut-off less than or equal to22) and AACD-dementia (cut-off less than or equal to26), with the following diagnostic parameters, respectively: sensitivity 93.9%-80%, specificity 94.7%-84.3%, positive likelihood ratio 17.8-5.1, negative likelihood ratio 0.06-0.24, and accuracy 94.6%-83.4%. The areas under the ROC curve were 0.985 (95% Confidence Intervals (CI) 0.967-0.995) and 0.904 (95% CI: 0.870-0.932) respectively. The intraclass correlation coefficient was 0.79 (0.74-0.83). Conclusion The PCL is a simple instrument, which is both valid and reliable, for the screening of dementia in population samples of individuals with low educational level. This instrument could be useful in primary health care. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

To determine whether changes in the central histaminergic system are a feature of human HE, we studied histamine, tele-methylhistamine, and presynaptic autoregulatory H-3 receptors in cerebral cortex and caudate-putamen obtained at autopsy from six cirrhotic patients and six appropriately matched controls. Methods: Histamine was assayed by HPLC; tele-methylhistamine by GC-MS. H-3 receptors were studied by in vitro receptor binding using [H-3]R-alpha-methylhistamine as ligand. Results: In HE patients, there was a significant fourfold increase of histamine in caudate-putamen and a significant increase in all cortical regions studied. tele-Methyhistamine was also increased and the densities of histamine H-3 receptor sites were significantly decreased in patient material. Conclusions: These findings are consistent with activation of the histaminergic system in HE. Given that histamine participates in the regulation of arousal and circadian rhythmicity, they indicate that induction of central histamine mechanisms may contribute to the development of neuropsychiatric symptoms, such as sleep disturbances and altered circadian rhythms in chronic HE and suggest that pharmacological manipulation of the histaminergic system could be beneficial in the treatment of HE in chronic liver failure.

It activates the extracellular regulated kinases and phosphatidyl inositol-3 kinase signal cascades, among others, and increases expression of cyclins D and B. Structurally, it belongs to none of the well-established growth factor families. It regulates developmental events as diverse as the onset of cavitation in the preimplantation embryo and male-specific brain differentiation. During wound repair it promotes granulation and neovascularization. It regulates inflammation through a tripartite loop with secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (SLPI) which protects pgrn from proteolysis, and elastase, which digests it to smaller peptides. Intact pgrn is anti-inflammatory through the inhibition of some of the actions of tumor necrosis factor, while the proteolytic peptides may stimulate the production of proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin 8. Pgrn is highly expressed in aggressive cancer cell lines and clinical specimens including breast, ovarian, and renal cancers as well as gliomas. In experimental systems it confers an aggressive phenotype on poorly tumorigenic epithelial cancer cells. The malignancy of highly tumorigenic progranulin-expressing cell lines depends on the expression level of the pgrn gene since attenuating pgrn mRNA levels in pgrn-responsive cells greatly inhibits tumor progression. Given its actions in wound repair and tumorigenesis pgrn may prove a useful clinical target, both for prognosis and for therapy.

Being dynamic and malleable processes, development and aging are controlled not only by genes but also by environmental and epigenetic influences that predominate in the second half of life. Genetic mutations affect many phenotypes in flies, worms, rodents, and humans which share several diseases or their equivalents, including cancer, neurodegeneration, and infectious disorders as well as their susceptibility to them. Life span and stress resistance are closely linked. Oxidative stress actually constitutes a defined hypothesis of aging in that macromolecule oxidative damage accumulates with age and tends to be associated with life expectancy. DNA methylation, a force in the regulation of gene expression, is also one of the biomarkers of genetic damage. The mitotic clock of aging is marked, if not guided, by telomeres, essential genetic elements stabilizing natural chromosomic ends. The dream of humans to live longer, healthy lives is being tested by attempts to modify longevity in animal models, frequently by dietary manipulation. The quest continues to understand the mechanisms of healthy aging, one of the most compelling areas of research in the 21st century. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Mild MTHFR deficiency, due to a common variant at nucleotide 677, has been reported to influence risk for several disorders including cardiovascular disease, neural tube defects, pregnancy complications and cancer. In recent work, we characterized the complete cDNA and gene sequences in the human and mouse genes, which had previously been mapped to chromosomes 1 and 4, respectively. During the course of this work, we observed that PCR primers in exons 1 and 2 of Mthfr generated amplicons of the expected size for the normal Mthfr transcript, using both reverse-transcribed RNA and genomic DNA as templates. These findings alluded to the existence of a pseudogene in the murine genome. Here, we report the characterization of this pseudogene. The absence of intron 1, the partial retention of intron 2, the location of this gene on chromosome 5, and the presence of sequences unrelated to Mthfr at the 5' and 3' ends of the 1259 bp fragment are features that are indicative of a partially-processed pseudogene, that we have designated Mthfr-ps. A Mthfr-ps transcript was not detectable by sensitive RT-PCR using assays designed to simultaneously detect the authentic Mthfr transcript. The structure of this paralogous gene and the identification of a repeat sequence at the 3' end of this pseudogene suggest that it arose by retrotransposition of a mis-spliced Mthfr transcript. Investigations of the Mthfr gene should take into account the presence of the non-functional Mthfr-ps to avoid misinterpretation of results.

The interaction of Hes1 with Gro/TLE is mediated by a WRPW tetrapeptide present in all Hairy/Enhancer of split (Hes) family members. In contrast to Hes1, the related protein Hes6 promotes neuronal differentiation. Little is known about the molecular mechanisms that underlie the neurogenic activity of Hes6. It is shown here that Hes6 antagonizes Hes1 function by two mechanisms. Hes6 inhibits the interaction of Hes1 with its transcriptional corepressor Gro/TLE. Moreover, it promotes proteolytic degradation of Hes1. This effect is maximal when both Hes1 and Hes6 contain the WRPW motif and is reduced when Hes6 is mutated to eliminate a conserved site (Ser183) that can be phosphorylated by protein kinase CK2. Consistent with these findings, Hes6 inhibits Hes1-mediated transcriptional repression in cortical neural progenitor cells and promotes the differentiation of cortical neurons, a process that is normally inhibited by Hes1. Mutation of Ser183 impairs the neurogenic ability of Hes6. Taken together, these findings clarify the molecular events underlying the neurogenic function of Hes6 and suggest that this factor can antagonize Hes1 activity by multiple mechanisms.

J	Fellows, LK; Foster, BJ; Chalk, CH				Fellows, LK; Foster, BJ; Chalk, CH			Clinical significance of complex repetitive discharges: A case-control study	MUSCLE & NERVE			English	Article						complex repetitive discharges; electromyography; motor neuron disease; myopathy; spontaneous activity	MUSCLE	Complex repetitive discharges (CRDs) are a striking, infrequent finding on needle electromyography (EMG), but their significance is debated. This retrospective case-control study of 486 patients evaluated in a general hospital-based EMG laboratory examined the association of CRDs with specific diag nostic categories, duration of symptoms, and comorbid diabetes mellitus. No CRDs were identified in patients without other evidence of neuromuscular disease. Myopathy was associated with an increased risk of CRDs (adjusted odds ratio, 5.98; 95% confidence interval, 2.38 to 14.99). In general, neuropathic conditions were not associated with either an increased or decreased risk of CRDs compared with other neuromuscular diseases, although confidence intervals were wide. Similarly, neither the chronicity of symptoms nor the presence of diabetes yielded odds ratios that differed significantly from unity. In clinical populations similar to the one we studied, the positive predictive value of CRDs for any of the diagnoses we evaluated is low. However, the absence of CRDs can be of diagnostic value in that it reduces the likelihood of myopathy or motor neuron disease. The likelihood of finding CRDs in acute conditions is the same as that in chronic conditions.

However, osmotically stimulated cells regulate volume(5) normally, whereas systemic osmoregulatory responses are sustained(6,7). Here we report that osmosensory neurons of rat supraoptic nucleus expressed significant membrane reserves, and could not regulate volume or total membrane surface area during osmotic perturbations, which may allow mechanosensitive channels to encode the amplitude and time course of an osmotic stimulus.

The statistical analysis of fMRI data usually includes a standard model of the hemodynamic response function (HRF) but it is not known how well this fits the actual HRF of epileptic spikes. The objective of this exploratory study was to compare the activated areas and t-statistical scores obtained with a standard HRF to those obtained with a patient-specific HRF. Eight patients with focal epilepsy were studied. We obtained an estimate of the patient-specific HRFs for each patient at the local maximum of activation in the standard HRF analysis. The activated areas obtained with the patient-specific HRFs were larger or similar to the originally activated areas. Additional activated areas were seen in five patients, and most were compatible with the EEG and anatomical MRI localization of epileptogenic and lesional regions. Using patient-specific HRFs brings increased sensitivity to the analysis of epileptic spikes by EEG-fMRI. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Following intensive MI training over several days, which led to a modest but significant improvement in performance, healthy subjects showed an increase in activity restricted to the medial aspect of the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), and a decrease in the cerebellum. These main results are largely consistent with those found in a previous study of sequence learning performed in our laboratory after physical practice of the same task [NeuroImage 16 (2002) 142]. Further analyses showed a positive correlation between the blood flow increase in the OFC and the percentage of improvement on the foot sequence task. Moreover, the increased involvement of the medial OFC revealed a modality specific anatomo-functional organization, as imagination of the sequential task after MI practice activated a more posterior region than its execution. These results demonstrate that learning a sequential motor task through motor imagery practice produces cerebral functional changes similar to those observed after physical practice of the same task. Moreover, the findings are in accord with the hypothesis that mental practice with MI, at least initially, improves performance by acting on the preparation and anticipation of movements rather than on execution per se.

We used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to examine the structural organization of two auditory cortical regions, Heschl's gyrus (HG) and the planum temporale (PT), in deaf and hearing subjects. The results show preservation of cortical volume in HG and PT of deaf subjects deprived of auditory input since birth. Measurements of grey and white matter, as well as the location and extent of these regions in the deaf showed complete overlap both with matched controls and with previous samples of hearing subjects. The results of the manual volume measures were supported by findings from voxel-based morphometry analyses that showed increased grey-matter density in the left motor hand area of the deaf, but no differences between the groups in any auditory cortical region. This increased cortical density in motor cortex may be related to more active use of the dominant hand in signed languages. Most importantly, expected interhemispheric asymmetries in HG and PT thought to be related to auditory language processing were preserved in these deaf subjects. These findings suggest a strong genetic component in the development and maintenance of auditory cortical asymmetries that does not depend on auditory language experience. Preservation of cortical volume in the deaf suggests plasticity in the input and output of auditon, cortex that could include language-specific or more general-purpose information from other sensory modalities.

However, even with the extensive use of sensor), thalamic stimulation as a clinical tool in the relief of chronic pain, the results are still inconsistent. This discrepancy could probably be explained by the fact that the majority of these studies are case reports or retrospective analyses, which have often used imprecise pain measurements that do not allow a rigorous statistical evaluation of pain relief. None of these studies measured the effect of stimulation on clinical pain for longer than a few hours per day, which is an important aspect considering that clinical pain can vary over time. Moreover, placebo controls are seldom included. In the current study, we measured patients' pain perception at home over a 2-week period, both during days of normal stimulation of the sensory thalamus and during days without stimulation. Patients also came to the laboratory to assess the effects of thalamic and placebo stimulation on clinical pain, experimental heat pain, innocuous air puff and visual stimulation. A potential relation between the perceived paresthesia and analgesic efficacy during thalamic and placebo stimulation was also explored. We found that thalamic stimulation significantly affected clinical and experimental pain perception, but that an important placebo component also exists. On the other hand, neither thalamic nor placebo stimulation affected air puff and visual ratings, suggesting that the effect applies specifically to pain and hence is not caused by a general change in attention. The level of paresthesia elicited during the placebo manipulation was also directly correlated with the degree of placebo pain relief. These results suggest that thalamic stimulation produces a small but significant reduction in pain perception, but that a significant placebo effect also exists.

J	Pruessner, JC; Kirschbaum, C; Meinlschmid, G; Hellhammer, DH				Pruessner, JC; Kirschbaum, C; Meinlschmid, G; Hellhammer, DH			Two formulas for computation of the area under the curve represent measures of total hormone concentration versus time-dependent change	PSYCHONEUROENDOCRINOLOGY			English	Article						area under the curve; repeated hormone measures; total concentrations; changes over time	HPA-AXIS; CORTISOL; STRESS; RESPONSES	Study protocols in endocrinological research and the neurosciences often employ repeated measurements over time to record changes in physiological or endocrinological variables. While it is desirable to acquire repeated measurements for finding individual and group differences with regard to response time and duration, the amount of data gathered often represents a problem for the statistical analysis. When trying to detect possible associations between repeated measures and other variables, the area under the curve (AUC) is routinely used to incorporate multiple time points. However, formulas for computation of the AUC are not standardized across laboratories, and existing differences are usually not presented when discussing results, thus causing possible variability, or incompatibility of findings between research groups. In this paper, two formulas for calculation of the area under the curve are presented, which are derived from the trapezoid formula. These formulas are termed 'Area under the curve with respect to increase' (AUC(L)) and 'Area under the curve with respect to ground' (AUC(G)). The different information that can be derived from repeated measurements with these two formulas is exemplified using artificial and real data from recent studies of the authors. It is shown that depending on which formula is used, different associations with other variables may emerge. Consequently, it is recommended to employ both formulas when analyzing data sets with repeated measures. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

We take advantage of the spatial nature of the data to reduce the noise in certain key parameters, achieving an increase in degrees of freedom for a mixed effects analysis. Our main interest is the analysis of the resulting images of test statistics using the geometry of random fields. We show how the Euler characteristic of the excursion set plays a key role in setting the threshold of the image to detect regions of the brain activated by a stimulus.

Identifying and defining the characteristic features of the many different neuronal types is essential for achieving a cellular understanding of complex activity from perception to cognition. So far, cortical GABAergic interneurons have represented the epitome of cellular diversity in the CNS. Despite the desperate need for effective classification criteria allowing a common language among neuroscientists, interneurons still evoke memories of Babel. Several approaches are now available to overcome the challenges and problems associated with the various classification systems used so far.

Recent experiments have suggested that interactions between osmotic and circadian factors may be important for homeostasis. The existence of an in vitro slice preparation retaining these nuclei and their interconnections would therefore be useful for the analysis of synaptic interactions. In the rat, the OVLT, SCN and SON are found at increasingly ventral and lateral positions along the rostro-caudal axis, such that conventional 400 mum slices taken in the pure coronal or horizontal planes do not retain all three nuclei. Here we show that horizontal slices cut at angles of 38-42degrees relative to the dorsal surface of the cortex retain large fractions of the three nuclei. Intracellular recordings revealed membrane properties consistent with those previously published for OVLT, SCN and SON neurons. Moreover, antidromic and synaptic responses evoked by electrical stimulation revealed that extensive axonal projections are retained between these nuclei. Finally, chemical and osmotic stimulation of the OVLT exerted powerful influences on the rate of spontaneous synaptic events in SON neurons. We therefore conclude that angled horizontal hypothalamic slices represent a useful preparation for the analysis of physiological interactions between the OVLT, SCN and SON. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

The impact of this complex interrelationship on pathological outcomes is poorly understood. In the present investigation the stressor-reactive BALB/cByJ and the relatively stressor resilient C57BL/6ByJ mice were maintained on a macronutrient selection protocol or given free access to chow for 20 months. The C57BL/6ByJ mice exhibited a marked preference for fat over carbohydrates, whereas BALB/cByJ mice preferred carbohydrates over fat. Cognitive testing in a Morris water maze indicated that while BALB/cByJ mice were clearly more impaired in this task relative to their C57BL/6ByJ counterparts, there was no substantial effect of the diet at either 13 or 19 months of age. Furthermore, despite their stressor resiliency, at 19 months of age, C57BL/6ByJ mice who invariably consumed fat, exhibited greater plasma corticosterone responses to a 20-min period of restraint than chow fed animals. Indeed, the corticosterone rise was as pronounced as in the more reactive BALB/cByJ strain. Furthermore, the C57BL/6ByJ diet-fed mice showed features of insulin insensitivity and increased adiposity. These data suggest that the adverse effects of fat consumption need to be considered in the context of genetically determined vulnerability/resilience factors. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Despite their archetypical organization, the maps maintain the capacity to rapidly reorganize, suggesting that the neural circuitry underlying cortical representations is inherently plastic. Here we show that the circuitry supporting motor maps is dependent upon continued protein synthesis. Injections of two different protein synthesis inhibitors into adult rat forelimb motor cortex caused an immediate and enduring loss of movement representations. The disappearance of the motor map was accompanied by a significant reduction in synapse number, synapse size, and cortical field potentials and caused skilled forelimb movement impairments. Further, motor skill training led to a reappearance of movement representations. We propose that the circuitry of adult motor cortex is perpetually labile and requires continued protein synthesis in order to maintain its functional organization.

In order to understand the underlying mechanisms responsible for these processes, we studied early effects of this metal in a sub-acute rat model. Levels of manganese in the globus pallidus were increased by 81% after 1 day of treatment and elevated by 551% compared to controls after 4 days. In addition, manganese treatment led to a 60% increase in ptbr expression, and a 105% increase in levels of its product, the isoquinoline-carboxamide binding protein, a major constituent of the 'peripheral-type' benzodiazepine receptor (PTBR) that is localized to astrocytes, in this brain region after 4 days. These results indicate that PTBRs, and possibly neurosteroids, are an early response to manganese exposure and may play a major role in the pathophysiology of MN. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

We report an association of the C(-1019)G 5-HT1A promoter polymorphism with major depression and suicide in separate cohorts. In depressed patients, the homozygous G(-1019) allele was enriched twofold versus controls (p = 0.0017 and 0.0006 for G/G genotype and G allele distribution, respectively), and in completed suicide cases the G(-1019) allele was enriched fourfold (p = 0.002 and 0.00008 for G/G genotype and G allele distribution, respectively). The C(-1019) allele was part of a 26 bp imperfect palindrome that bound transcription factors nuclear NUDR [nuclear deformed epidermal autoregulatory factor (DEAF-1)]/suppressin and Hairy/Enhancer-of-split-5 (Drosophila) (Hes5) to repress 5-HT1A or heterologous promoters, whereas the G(-1019) allele abolished repression by NUDR, but only partially impaired Hes5-mediated repression. Recombinant NUDR bound specifically to the 26 bp palindrome, and endogenous NUDR was present in the major protein-DNA complex from raphe nuclear extracts. Stable expression of NUDR in raphe cells reduced levels of endogenous 5-HT1A protein and binding. NUDR protein was colocalized with 5-HT1A receptors in serotonergic raphe cells, hippocampal and cortical neurons, and adult brain regions including raphe nuclei, indicating a role in regulating 5-HT1A autoreceptor expression. Our data indicate that NUDR is a repressor of the 5-HT1A receptor in raphe cells the function of which is abrogated by a promoter polymorphism. We suggest a novel transcriptional model in which the G(-1019) allele derepresses 5-HT1A autoreceptor expression to reduce serotonergic neurotransmission, predisposing to depression and suicide.

For a period of 10 min, rats were observed for spontaneous nociceptive behaviours (SNBs), including: tail elevation, twitching or licking; hindpaw elevation, licking or shaking; and caudally directed biting or scratching. The amount of time each rat spent eliciting these individual behaviours was recorded and a total time (in seconds) spent exhibiting SNBs was then calculated. To determine which glutamate receptors are primarily responsible for these nociceptive behaviours, we pretreated additional groups of rats with selective antagonists for N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole proprionic acid/kainate (AMPA/KA) and group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR 1 and 5). Results indicate that SAAs dose-dependently produce SNBs that are attenuated by NMDA receptor and group I mGluR antagonists. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Bossert, JM; Franklin, KBJ				Bossert, JM; Franklin, KBJ			Reinforcing versus anticonvulsant drugs: effects on intracranial self-stimulation rate-frequency M-50 indices	BEHAVIOURAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						pentobarbital; gabapentin; amphetamine; brain stimulation; GABA; medial forebrain bundle	VENTRAL TEGMENTAL AREA; BRAIN-STIMULATION; GABAERGIC INHIBITION; REWARD THRESHOLDS; GABA AGONISTS; GABAPENTIN; COCAINE; ABUSE; AMPHETAMINE; BEHAVIOR	Drugs of abuse, such as amphetamine and morphine, produce reward-related shifts on intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) thresholds. The facilitatory effects on ICSS thresholds of drugs that act through the GABAergic system, however, are reported to be attributed to their antiseizure and anticonvulsant effects, rather than their reinforcing effects. Using a rate-frequency ICSS paradigm, we examined the effects of amphetamine (a reinforcing drug of abuse that acts via the catecholaminergic system), pentobarbital (a GABA(A) receptor agonist and reinforcing barbiturate with anticonvulsant properties), and gabapentin (a nonspecific GABAergic agonist and anticonvulsant with low abuse potential) on ICSS M-50 indices. All three doses of amphetamine (0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 mg/kg) and pentobarbital (2.5, 5.0, and 10.0 mg/kg) significantly lowered rate-frequency M-50 values. Gabapentin, on the other hand, significantly raised rate-frequency M-50 values, albeit only at the highest dose administered (30 mg/kg). Our results indicate that shifts in ICSS M-50 values produced by pentobarbital are associated with the reinforcing, not the anticonvulsant, effect of pentobarbital. These results are consistent with the view that there is a common system underlying the reinforcing effects of drugs and ICSS reinforcement, and suggest that the reinforcing and anticonvulsant effects of GABA agonists are dissociable.

For example, while there is agreement that the N170 component of event-related potentials is sensitive to face processing, there is considerable debate about whether its response reflects a structural encoder for faces, a feature (e.g. eye) detector, or something else. We introduce a principled approach to determine the stimulus features driving brain responses. Our analyses on two observers resolving different face categorization tasks (gender and expressive or not) reveal that the N170 responds to the eyes within a face irrespective of task demands. This suggests a new methodology to attribute function to different components of the neural system for perceiving complex stimuli. (C) 2003 Lippincott Williams Wilkins.

While family history and genetic factors are important individual risk factors for narcolepsy, environmental factors also contribute to the pathogenesis of the disease. The aim of the study was to find out whether there is a seasonality of month of birth in narcoleptic patients. Design: Diagnosis of narcolepsy with cataplexy was based on International Classification of Sleep Disorders criteria with clinical, standard polysomnographic, and Multiple Sleep Latency Test features. Patients and Setting: The birth dates of 886 patients with a clear-cut diagnosis of narcolepsy with cataplexy from 3 large narcolepsy databases (352 from Montpellier-France, 157 from Montreal-Canada, and 377 from Stanford-United States of America) were compared with those of 35,160,522 subjects from the general population. Measurements and Results: Patients with narcolepsy had a significantly different seasonality of month of birth compared to that of the general population. The monthly distribution of birth yielded a peak in March with a maximal odds ratio at 1.45 and a trough in September with a minimal odds ratio at 0.63. No gender or country of origin differences were observed. Conclusions: A birth seasonality in the development of narcolepsy suggests the presence of environmental factors acting in combination with genetic factors during the fetal or perinatal period, in terms of an autoimmune process targeting the hypocretin system.

The aim of the present study was to test the hypothesis in humans that an oral dose of ethanol would lead to dopamine release in the ventral striatum, including the nucleus accumbens. Six healthy subjects underwent two [C-11]raclopride PET scans following either alcohol (1 ml/kg) in orange juice or orange juice alone. Subjective mood changes, heart rate, and blood-alcohol levels were monitored throughout the procedure. Personality traits were evaluated using the tridimensional personality questionnaire. PET images were co-registered with MRI and transformed into stereotaxic space. Statistical parametric maps of [C-11]raclopride binding potential change were generated. There was a significant reduction in [C-11]raclopride binding potential bilaterally in the ventral striatum/nucleus accumbens in the alcohol condition compared to the orange juice condition, indicative of increased extracellular dopamine. Moreover, the magnitude of the change in [C-11]raclopride binding correlated with the alcohol-induced increase in heart rate, which is thought to be a marker of the psychostimulant effects of the drug, and with the personality dimension of impulsiveness. The present study is the first report that, in humans, alcohol promotes dopamine release in the brain, with a preferential effect in the ventral striatum. These findings support the hypothesis that mesolimbic dopamine activation is a common property of abused substances, possibly mediating their reinforcing effects. (C) 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

The primary combustion products of MMT are Mn phosphate, Mn sulfate, and a Mn phosphate/Mn sulfate mixture. Concerns have been raised that the combustion products of MMT containing Mn could be neurotoxic, even at low levels of exposure. The objective of this study is to investigate exposure-response relationships for bioaccumulation and locomotor effects following subchronic inhalation exposure to a mixture of manganese phosphates/sulfate mixture. A control group and three groups of 30 male Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed in inhalation chambers for a period of 13 weeks, 5 days per week, 6 h a day. Exposure concentrations were 3000, 300, and 30 mug/m(3). At the end of the exposure period, locomotor activity and resting time tests were conducted for 36 h using a computerized autotrack system. Rats were then euthanized by exsanguination and Mn concentrations in different tissues (liver, lung, testis, and kidney) and blood and brain (caudate putamen, globus pallidus, olfactory bulb, frontal cortex, and cerebellum) were determined by neutron activation analysis. Increased manganese concentrations were observed in blood, kidney, lung, testis, and in all brain sections in the highest exposure group. Mn in the lung and in the olfactory bulb were dose dependent. Our data indicate that the olfactory bulb accumulated more Mn than other brain regions following inhalation exposure. Locomotor activity was increased at 3000 mug/m(3), but no difference was observed in resting time among the exposed groups. At the end of the experiment, rats exposed to 300 and 3000 mug/m(3) exhibited significantly decreased body weight in comparison with the control group. Biochemical profiles also revealed some significant differences in certain parameters, specifically alkaline phospatase, urea, and chlorate. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The authors used [C-11](R)-PK11195 PET to localize in vivo microglial activation in patients with multiple system atrophy (MSA). Increased [C-11](R)-PK11195 binding was primarily found in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, putamen, pallidum, pons, and substantia nigra, reflecting the known distribution of neuropathologic changes in MSA. Providing an indicator of disease activity, [C-11](R)-PK11195 PET can thus be used to characterize the in vivo neuropathology of MSA.

Here, we show that Otx1 is expressed in hematopoietic pluripotent and erythroid progenitor cells. Moreover, bone marrow cells from mice lacking Otx1 exhibit a cell-autonomous impairment of the erythroid compartment. In agreement with these results, molecular analysis revealed decreased levels of erythroid genes that include the SCL and GATA-1 transcription factors. Accordingly, a gain of function of SCL rescues the erythroid deficiency in Otx1(-/-) mice. Taken together, our findings indicate a function for Otx1 in the regulation of blood cell production.

Several in vitro and in vivo models have been developed and used to study brain tumour invasion and cell motility. Here, we review some of the traditional in vitro models of brain tumour invasion and the latest adaptations to the widely used spheroid model. Several research groups studying the mechanisms mediating brain tumour invasion have made important contributions to the field by improving in vitro models of tumour migration and invasion. Sharing these advances will hopefully accelerate experimental discovery and the development of novel anti-invasion brain tumour therapies.

Innovation, new or modified learned behaviour not previously found in the population, is the first stage in many instances of cultural transmission and may play an important role in the lives of animals with generalist or opportunistic lifestyles. Within-species, innovation is associated with low neophobia, high neophilia, and with high social learning propensities. Indices of innovatory propensities can be calculated for taxonomic groups by counting the frequency of reports of innovation in published literature. These innovation rate data provide a useful comparative measure for studies of behavioural flexibility and cognition. Innovation rate is positively correlated with the relative size of association areas in the brain, namely the hyperstriatum ventrale and neostriatum in birds, and the neocortex and striatum in primates. Innovation rate is also positively correlated with the reported variety of tool use, as well as interspecific differences in learning. Current evidence thus suggests similar patterns of cognitive evolution in primates and birds.

In contrast, the adult form of the disease has been rarely described, and the etiology of this variant remains unknown. Objective: To characterize the clinical phenotype and identify the gene causing an autosomal dominant form of adult Alexander disease. Methods: We identified a large kindred segregating clinical features compatible with adult Alexander disease in an autosomal dominant fashion. A neurological examination was performed on all affected members of this family. Most of these patients also underwent magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and a polysomnographic study. The diagnosis was confirmed pathologically in 2 individuals. We screened all coding regions of the GFAP gene in affected individuals by means of direct sequencing and single-stranded conformational polymorphisms analysis. Results: We found a novel D78E mutation in GFAP in all affected individuals. This mutation was not detected in more than 100 control subjects. Clinical and radiological features of affected individuals were clearly different from those of patients with the infantile and juvenile forms of the disease. The most consistent finding was the presence of bulbar signs. In addition, sleep disturbance (mainly sleep apnea), symptoms of dysautonomia, and dysmorphism were found in all affected individuals. In younger patients, magnetic resonance imaging showed T2 signal abnormalities in the medulla compatible with an area of demyelination. in contrast, in older patients, we found marked atrophy of the medulla without signal abnormalities. None of the affected individuals exhibit signs of demyelination of the cerebral white matter. Conclusions: The present study is the first demonstration of a mutation in GFAP that causes an autosomal dominant form of Alexander disease and establishes the existence of the adult variant. Clinical evaluation in individuals carrying mutation in the GFAP gene allowed and will help increase its recognition in neurological practice.

We now report new interactions between p97 and another LRP ligand, the urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) complex. By using biospecific interaction analysis, both pro-uPA and plasminogen are shown to interact with immobilized p97. Moreover, the activation of plasminogen by pro-uPA is increased by soluble p97. Because the uPA system plays a crucial role in cell migration, both in cancer and in angiogenesis, we also measured the impact of both endogenous membrane-bound and exogenous p97 on cell migration. The monoclonal antibody L235 (which recognizes a conformational epitope on p97) inhibited the migration of human microvascular endothelial cells (HMECs-1) and of human melanoma SK-MEL-28 cells, indicating that endogenous membrane-bound p97 could be associated with this process. In addition, low concentrations of exogenous p97 (10 and 100 nM) inhibited HMEC-1 and SK-MEL28 cell migration by more than 50%. These results indicate that membrane-bound and soluble p97 affect the migration capacity of endothelial and melanoma cells and suggest that p97 could be involved in the regulation of plasminogen activation by interacting with pro-uPA and plasminogen.

Naloxone (2 mg kg(-1); i.p.) challenge precipitated a robust withdrawal syndrome that depleted CGRP-like immunoreactivity and increased the number of Fos-like immunoreactive neurons in the dorsal horn. 3 Intrathecal administration of NDGA (10, 20 mug), a nonselective LOX inhibitor, AA-861 (1.5, 3 mug), a 5-LOX selective inhibitor, or baicalein (1.4, 2.8 mug), a 12-LOX selective inhibitor, concurrently with systemic morphine for 5 days or as a single injection immediately preceding naloxone challenge, blocked the depletion of CGRP-like immunoreactivity, prevented increase in the number of Fos-like immunoreactive neurons in the dorsal horn, and significantly attenuated the morphine withdrawal syndrome. 4 The results of this study suggest that activity of LOX products, at the spinal level, contributes to the expression of opioid physical dependence, and that this activity may be expressed through increased sensory neuropeptide release.

All mutations are small deletions that are predicted to result in a frameshift and premature truncation of the alsin protein. Here we describe a ninth ALS2 mutation, in two siblings affected by infantile-onset ascending spastic paraplegia with bulbar involvement. This mutation is predicted to result in the substitution of an amino acid by a stop codon, and thus is the first nonsense mutation detected in this gene. It is probable that full-length alsin is required for the proper development and/or functioning of upper motor neurons.

Indeed, hit was the first caspase substrate to be identified in the brain. Since that time, the identification of caspase-generated N-terminal hit fragments in the patient brain and the accelerated phenotype of transgenic mice expressing truncated fragments of htt support the hypothesis that htt proteolysis contributes to the pathogenesis of htt. However, selective and quantitative neuronal loss has so far been observed only in mice with expression of full-length human htt, suggesting the possibility that generating htt fragments from the intact protein may be essential for selective neuronal loss to be evident. Furthermore, a characteristic neuropathological hallmark of HID in patient brain and animal models is the presence of intracellular aggregates composed of htt fragments containing the polyglutamine expansion. Because numerous Studies have demonstrated enhanced cytotoxicity and aggregenic potential of amino-terminal hit fragments containing expanded polyglutamine repeats, an understanding of precisely how hit is cleaved within the brain may result in novel therapeutic approaches for HD. In this review, we integrate many observations on proteolysis in HID, attempt to synthesize a coherent view of how proteolysis may contribute to the pathogenesis of HD, and comment on the future potential of protease inhibitors as a therapeutic strategy for this devastating illness.

An overview is presented of human clinical and animal experimental findings showing the involvement of the thalamus, at the level of white matter tracts and separate nuclei, in aspects of memory functioning. The region in the thalamus that contributes to declarative memory is the anterior and medial division, containing the anterior nuclei, the medial dorsal nucleus and the intralaminar and midline nuclei. A lesion to the anterior nuclei or their afferent white matter tract, the mammillothalamic tract, results in deficits of encoding of new stimuli. Lesions to the medial dorsal nucleus affect executive processes pertaining to declarative memory, such as the use of memory strategies for retrieval; damage to the intralaminar and midline nuclei results in decreased arousal and thus affects the declarative memory process. Based on anatomical and functional data, a theory is proposed of how the thalamus might play a role at different levels of declarative memory functioning. Firstly, the anterior and mediodorsal nucleus are involved in processing the contents of the stimuli for storage and recall. The anterior nuclei influence the selection of material to be stored and remembered, whereas the mediodorsal nucleus is involved in the coordination and selection of the strategies used to retrieve material. Secondly, the intralaminar and midline nuclei and specifically the lateral and ventral components, maintain a necessary state of the cortical regions involved in the ongoing memory processes. The two types of function subserved by these groups of thalamic nuclei, focussing on contents vs. state, need to work in parallel to mediate and allow memory functioning, respectively.

Sustained epileptic discharges originate from the dysplastic neocortex and this tissue retains sufficient connectivity for expressing seizure abnormalities. In this brief review, we summarize the findings obtained by analyzing surgically-resected human tissue with focal cortical dysplasia that was maintained in vitro in a brain slice preparation. These data have been compared with those obtained from human cortex with normal structural organization; such tissue was available from patients undergoing surgery for a variety of neurological disorders, most often for mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. These studies have shown that: (i) slices obtained from focal cortical dysplastic tissue have an intrinsic ability to generate ictal-like epileptiform events when challenged with the convulsant drug 4-aminopyridine; (ii) 4-aminopyridine-induced ictal discharges are not seen in neocortical slices obtained from neocortical samples with no or minimal structural lesion; (iii) these ictal discharges are caused by the activation of excitatory amino acid receptors, and in particular those of the N-methyl-D aspartate type; (iv) focal cortical dysplastic tissue also generates synchronous potentials that are mainly contributed by GABA(A) receptor-mediated conductances.

This is due to the fact that identification of many of these malformations on visual inspection of conventional MRI is difficult due to their subtlety and the complexity of the brain's convolutions. Quantitative MR image processing methods have the potential to help identify lesions that may be overlooked by conventional radiological evaluation. To increase the sensitivity of MRI for the detection of subtle lesions of FCD, we recently developed voxel-based image post-processing methods, including first-order texture analysis and morphological processing modeled on known MRI features of FCD. Using these methods we were able to increase the sensitivity over conventional MRI analysis by more than 30%, while maintaining a high degree of reliability. The image processing methods we developed improve visual detection of FCD, even in cases where no lesion is obvious on MRI. Therefore, these techniques could allow a more precise evaluation of patients with partial epilepsy who could benefit from surgery.

In contrast, the apolipoprotein E (apoE) gene has proven to be a risk factor for AD with apoE epsilon4 AD patients having been found to show lower levels of brain apoE. In the present study, treatment of primary rat mixed glial cell cultures with the common NSAIDs, indomethacin and aspirin, induced significant increases in extracellular apoE protein levels. Similarly, treatment of primary rat astrocyte cell cultures with aspirin and a cyclooxygenase (COX)-2-selective aspirin derivative also stimulated significant increases in apoE protein. However, astrocyte and mixed glial apoE protein levels were significantly reduced following exposure to COX-2-specific indomethacin amides and an inactive indomethacin derivative. ApoE protein modulation was observed at physiological and subphysiological concentrations well below the COX inhibition IC50 values of the NSAIDs used, suggestive of a COX-independent mechanism. In contrast to these results, indomethacin and aspirin treatment failed to induce any significant changes in apoE mRNA levels. The failure of NSAIDs to significantly alter apoE expression may have been indicative of a nontranscriptional mechanism of apoE protein induction. Consequently, NSAID-induced increases in apoE protein may enhance apoE-mediated immunosuppression and compensatory synaptic plasticity, potentially resulting in decreased AD risk and delay of disease onset.

Dramatic changes in the expression of MMPs and TIMPs occur during excitotoxic/neuroinflammatory processes. However, only the measurement of net protease activity is relevant physiologically, and the functional consequences of MMP/TIMP ratio modifications in the brain remain elusive. In order to assess MMP activity and effects in brain tissue, we combined in vivo and organotypic culture models of kainate (KA)-induced excitotoxicity to provoke selective neuronal death and neuroinflammation in the hippocampus. Using in situ zymography, we show that KA-induced excitotoxic seizures in rats increase net MMP activity in hippocampal neurons 8 h after seizures, before their death, and that this increase is neuronal activity-dependent. Three days after KA, proteolytic activity increases in blood vessels and reactive glial cells of vulnerable areas, in relation with neuroinflammation. At 7 and 15 days, proteolysis remains high in blood vessels whereas it is reduced in glia. In organotypic hippocampal cultures, which lack blood cell-mediated inflammation and extrinsic connections, a broad-spectrum inhibitor of MMPs (MMPI), but also a selective MMP-9 inhibitor, protect hippocampal neurons against KA-induced excitotoxicity. Moreover, recombinant MMP-9, but not MMP-2, induces selective pyramidal cell death in these cultures and KA-induced neuronal activity exacerbates the neuronal death promoting effects of MMP-9. These data strongly implicate MMPs, and MMP-9 in particular, in both excitotoxic neuronal damage and subsequent neuroinflammatory processes, and suggest that selective MMPIs could be therapeutically relevant in related neurological disorders.

The inhibitory effect of the specific p38 blockers, PD 169316 and SB 203580, on ascorbate-induced myelination was exerted during the early stages (1-2 days) of ascorbate treatment. Inhibition of p38 was further shown to prevent the alignment of Schwann cells along axons in laminin-treated cocultures. The addition of laminin to Schwann cell-dorsal root ganglion neuron cocultures stimulated phosphorylation of p38, thereby demonstrating a link between laminin-induced myelination and p38 activation. Similarly, the small heat shock protein, Hsp27, which is phosphorylated by MAPKAPK2, a downstream substrate of p38, was phosphorylated in response to the addition of laminin to the cocultures. The p38 inhibitors did not affect the proliferation or survival of Schwann cells in the cocultures as assessed by BrdU incorporation and total cell counts. However, p38 inhibition interfered with an early stage in myelination, thereby preventing ascorbate-induced increases in the levels of mRNAs encoding MBP, MAG, and P-o and reducing laminin deposition. These results indicate that activation of p38 by a signaling pathway(s) involving laminin and appropriate integrin receptor(s) is required for the alignment of Schwann cells with axons that precedes myelination.

Mouse dorsal root ganglia neurons were seeded on a collagen sponge populated with human endothelial cells and/or human fibroblasts. Addition of nerve growth factor (NGF; 10 ng/ml) was not required for sensory neurons survival but was necessary to promote neurite outgrowth, as assessed by immunostaining of the 150 kDa neurofilament. A vigorous neurite elongation was detected inside the reconstructed tissue after 14 and 31 days of neurons culture, reaching up to 770 mum from day 14. Axons were often observed closely associated with the capillary-like tubes reconstructed in the model, in a similar pattern as in the human dermis. The presence of endothelial cells induced a significant increase of the neurite elongation after 14 days of culture. The addition of human keratinocytes totally avoided the twofold decrease in the amount of neurites observed between 14 and 31 days in controls. Besides the addition of NGF, axonal growth did not necessitate B27 supplement or glial cell coculture to be promoted and stabilized for long-term culture. Thus, this model might be a valuable tool to study the effect of various cells and/or attractive or repulsive molecules on neurite outgrowth in vitro.

Methods: H-1 and C-13 NMR spectroscopy using [1-C-13] glucose was performed on extracts of frontal cortex obtained from groups of rats with acute liver failure induced by hepatic devascularization whose body temperature was maintained either at 37degreesC (normothermic) or 35degreesC (hypothermic), and appropriate sham-operated controls. Results: At coma stages of encephalopathy in the normothermic acute liver failure animals, glutamine concentrations in frontal cortex increased 3.5-fold compared to sham-operated controls (P < 0.001). Comparable increases of brain glutamine were observed in hypothermic animals despite the absence of severe encephalopathy (coma). Brain glutamate and aspartate concentrations were respectively decreased to 60.9% +/- 7.7% and 42.2% +/- 5.9% (P < 0.01) in normothermic animals with acute liver failure compared to control and were restored to normal values by mild hypothermia. Concentrations of lactate and alanine in frontal cortex were increased to 169.2% +/- 15.6% and 267.3% +/- 34.0% (P < 0.01) respectively in normothermic rats compared to controls. Furthermore, de novo synthesis of lactate and alanine increased to 446.5% +/- 48.7% and 707.9% +/- 65.7% (P < 0.001), of control respectively, resulting in increased fractional C-13-enrichments in these cytosolic metabolites. Again, these changes of lactate and alanine concentrations were prevented by mild hypothermia. Conclusions: Mild hypothermia (35degreesC) prevents the encephalopathy and brain edema resulting from hepatic devascularization, selectively normalizes lactate and alanine synthesis from glucose, and prevents the impairment of oxidative metabolism associated with this model of ALF, but has no significant effect on brain glutamine. These findings suggest that a deficit in brain glucose metabolism rather than glutamine accumulation is the major cause of the cerebral complications of acute liver failure.

Whereas Lpl+ heterozygotes show a mild tail defect (looped), homozygous Lp/Lp embryos show a very severe form of NTD, with a completely open neural tube from the hindbrain region to the caudal portion of the spinal cord (craniorachischisis). We have recently identified a positional candidate for Lp on chromosome 1, designated as Ltap. Here, we have used an in vivo complementation approach in transgenic mice to attempt to correct the looped-tail phenotype with a bacterial artificial chromosome clone (BAC280A23) that harbors a full-length copy of the Ltap gene. Genotype: phenotype correlations in Lpl+ heterozygotes carrying BAC280A23 show that this clone can rescue the looped-tail phenotype in two independent founder lines (P < 0.05 and P < 0.0001). Importantly, BAC280A23 is also observed to rescue the lethal NTD of Lp/Lp homozygotes, because several viable transgenic Lp/Lp mice could be identified and appeared normal (P < 0.05). Results from these gain-of-function transgenic animals strongly suggest that the positional candidate Ltap present in this BAC is indeed the gene that is defective in loop-tail.

The clearance of apoptotic leukocytes by tissue-specific phagocytes is critical in the resolution of the inflammatory infiltrate and leads to a profound downregulation of phagocyte immune functions. Adult human microglia from surgically removed normal brain tissue was used in a standardized, light-microscopic in vitro phagocytosis assay of apoptotic autologous peripheral blood-derived mononuclear cells (MNCs). Microglia from five different patients had a high capacity for the uptake of apoptotic MNCs in contrast to nonapoptotic target cells with the phagocytosis rate for nonapoptotic MNCs amounting to only 61.6% of the apoptotic MNCs. A newly described phosphatidylserine receptor, critical in the phagocytosis of apoptotic cells by macrophages, is also expressed at similar levels on human microglia. The effects of the therapeutically used immunomodulatory agent interferonbeta (IFNbeta) were investigated using Lewis rat microglia and apoptotic, encephalitogenic, myelin basic protein-specific autologous T-cells. Also, rat microglia had a high capacity to phagocytose apoptotic T-cells specifically. IFNbeta increased the phagocytosis of apoptotic T-cells to 36.8% above the untreated controls. The enhanced phagocytic activity was selective for apoptotic T-cells and was not mediated by increased IL-10 secretion. Apoptotic inflammatory cells may be efficiently and rapidly removed by microglial cells in the autoimmune-inflamed human CNS. The in vitro increase of phagocytosis by IFNbeta merits further investigations whether this mechanism could also be therapeutically exploited. (C) 2003 Wiley-Liss.

In this paper, we propose an evaluation framework, based on global and local measures of the relevance of the registration. We have chosen to focus more particularly on the matching of cortical areas, since intersubject registration methods are dedicated to anatomical and functional normalization, and also because other groups [7] have shown the relevance of such registration methods for deep brain structures. Experiments were conducted using 6 methods on a database of 18 subjects. The global measures used show that the quality of the registration is directly related to the transformation's degrees of freedom. More surprisingly, local measures based on the matching of cortical sulci did not show significant differences between rigid and non rigid methods.

Its novelty ties in the use of a multiobjective genetic algorithm where sensitivity analysis and neural network are employed to allow the use of a representative database to evaluate fitness and the use of a validation database to identify the subsets of selected features that provide a good generalization. Some advantages of this approach include the ability to accommodate multiple criteria such as number of features and accuracy of the classifier, as well as the capacity to deal with huge databases in order to adequately represent the pattern recognition problem. Comprehensive experiments on the NIST SD19 demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed methodology.

However, the evidence for this theory is not consistent with findings of an enhanced detection of local targets (Plaisted, O'Riordan, & Baron-Cohen, 1998b; Plaisted, Swettenham, & Rees, 1999), but a typical global bias (Mottron, Burack, Stauder, Robaey, 1999; Ozonoff, Strayer, McMahon, & Filloux, 1994). Method: Adolescents with high-functioning autism and CA- (approximately 15 years) and IQ- (approximately 105-110) matched typically developing adolescents were administered a series of global-local visual tasks, including a traditional task of hierarchical processing, three tasks of configural processing, and a disembedding task that involved rapid perceptual processing. Results: No group differences were found on either the traditional task of hierarchical processing or on tasks of configural processing. However, group differences were found on the disembedding task as the search for embedded, in relation to isolated stimuli, was slower for the typically developing adolescents but similar for the participants with autism. Conclusions: These findings are consistent with other reports of superior performance in detecting embedded figures (Jolliffe & Baron-Cohen, 1997; Shah & Frith, 1983), but typical performance in global and configural processing (Mottron, Burack et al., 1999; Ozonoff et al., 1994) among persons with high-functioning autism. Thus, the notions of local bias and global impairment that are part of WCC may need to be reexamined.

Materials and Methods: A CPMG sequence with 1 x 1 x 5 mm(3) resolution was used to quantify T-2 in a single axial slice at the midlevel of the occipital lobe in 23 healthy adult volunteers. Refocusing intervals of 8, 11, and 22 msec were compared. A Bayesian classifier was used to classify a 1 x 1 x 1 mm(3) T-1-weighted three-dimensional data set into gray matter, white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid, with an average 95% a posteriori probability used as the threshold for inclusion into a tissue-specific region of interest (ROI). Results: The usual T-2 contrast between the gray and white matter (i.e., T-2GM > T-2WM) was observed, with a highly significant effect of tissue type on the estimated T-2 (P < 10(-5)). The observed T-2 gradually decreased with increasing refocusing interval, for a decrease of 3.3 +/- 1.5 msec in gray matter and 3.0 +/- 1.5 msec in white matter between the 8 and 22 msec refocusing interval acquisitions. Conclusion: The observed T-2 shortening is consistent with the effect of the dramatic decrease in T-2 of partly deoxygenated blood on this range of refocusing rates.

It causes severe seizures, leading to dementia and eventually death in early adulthood. Methods: One Lafora disease gene, EPM2A, has been identified on chromosome 6q24. Locus heterogeneity led us to search for a second gene using a genome wide linkage scan in French-Canadian families. Results: We mapped a second Lafora disease locus, EPM2B, to a 2.2 Mb region at 6p22, a region known to code for several proteins, including kinesins. Kinesins are microtubule dependent motor proteins that are involved in transporting cellular components. In neurones, they play a major role in axonal and dendritic transport. Conclusion: Analysis of the present locus in other non-EPM2A families will reveal whether there is further locus heterogeneity. Identification of the disease gene will be of major importance towards our understanding of the pathogenesis of Lafora disease.

Semi-intact preparations of larval sea lamprey were used to determine the relative contribution of the middle (MRRN) and the posterior (PRRN) rhombencephalic reticular nuclei to swimming controlled by the MLR. Intracellular recordings were performed to examine the inputs from the MLR to RS neurons. Stimulation of the MLR elicited monosynaptic excitatory responses of a higher magnitude in the MRRN than in the PRRN. This differential effect was not attributed to intrinsic properties of RS neurons. Paired recordings showed that at threshold intensity for swimming, spiking activity was primarily elicited in RS cells of the MRRN. Interestingly, cells of the PRRN began to discharge at higher stimulation intensities only when MRRN cells had reached their maximal discharge rate. Glutamate antagonists were ejected in either nucleus to reduce their activity. Ejections over the MRRN increased the stimulation threshold for evoking locomotion and resulted in a marked decrease in the swimming frequency and the strength of the muscle contractions. Ejections over the PRRN decreased the frequency of swimming. This study provides support for the concept that RS cells show a specific recruitment pattern during MLR-induced locomotion. RS cells in the MRRN are primarily involved in initiation and maintenance of low-intensity swimming. At higher frequency locomotor rhythm, RS cells in both the MRRN and the PRRN are recruited.

We evaluated different methods for quantifying patient-physician discordance and identified factors associated with discordance in the assessment of lupus disease activity. Methods. Data from 208 female patients who had a comprehensive annual examination were extracted from the Montreal General Hospital Lupus Registry. Discordance was measured by the difference between the patient self-reported 10 cm visual analog scale (VAS) and the physician VAS for global disease activity (VASDIFF). Multiple linear regression was used to identify the correlates of discordance, e.g., SF-36(TM) scales, Systemic Lupus Activity Measure (SLAM) components, etc. Four regression models were estimated using: (1) all patients; (2) only patients who evaluated disease activity higher than their physician's assessment; (3) only patients who evaluated disease activity lower than their physician's assessment; and (4) all patients, with the absolute value of VASDIFF as the dependent variable. Results. Of the 208 observations, 150 (72%) of the VASDIFF scores were within +/-2.5 cm on a 10 cm scale, indicating absence of marked discordance; 43 (20.7%) were from patients overscoring and 15 (7.2%) from patients underscoring their physician by at least 2.5 cm. Higher SF-36 role physical score, more bodily pain, and lower role emotional score in addition to the SLAM-skin component were independently associated with higher discordance. SF-36 social function and mental health scores as well as SLAM-neurological and kidney components were correlated with discordance in some subanalyses. Bodily pain was the most important variable for predicting "clinically relevant" discordance, followed by SLAM-skin and kidney components. Conclusion. Discordance between patients and physicians may result from patients scoring their disease activity based on their psychological and physical well-being, whereas physicians score disease activity based on the clinical and physical signs and symptoms of lupus.

Early evidence showed that during sensitization, S-HT activates a cyclic AMP-protein kinase A (cAMP-PKA)-dependent pathway within specific sensory neurons (SNs), which increases their excitability and facilitates synaptic transmission onto their follower motor neurons (MNs). However, recent data suggest that serotonergic modulation during sensitization is more complex and diverse. The neuronal circuits mediating defensive reflexes contain a number of interneurons that respond to S-HT in ways opposite to those of the SNs, showing a decrease in excitability and/or synaptic depression. Moreover, in addition to acting through a cAMP-PKA pathway within SNs, 5-HT is also capable of activating a variety of other protein kinases such as protein kinase C, extracellular signal-regulated kinases, and tyrosine kinases. This diversity of 5-HT responses during sensitization suggests the presence of multiple S-HT receptor subtypes within the Aplysia central nervous system. Four S-HT receptors have been cloned and characterized to date. Although several others probably remain to be characterized in molecular terms, especially the Gs-coupled 5-HT receptor capable of activating cAMP-PKA pathways, the multiplicity of serotonergic mechanisms recruited into action during learning in Aplysia can now be addressed from a molecular point of view.

J	Janicki, C; Seuntjens, J				Janicki, C; Seuntjens, J			Re-evaluation of the dose to the cyst wall in P-32 radiocolloid treatments of cystic brain tumors using the Dose-Point-Kernel and Monte Carlo methods	MEDICAL PHYSICS			English	Article						radiation dosimetry; intracavity therapy; beta-emitting radionuclides; dose-point-kernel; Monte Carlo	CRANIOPHARYNGIOMAS; THERAPY	Intracavity instillation of beta-emitting colloid pharmaceuticals is a common technique used to treat cystic brain tumors. Most of the dosimetric calculations that have been reported in the literature for this problem are based on empirical formulas derived by Loevinger. Concentration of P-32 radiolabeled solution for the delivery of a prescribed dose (200 Gy to the cyst wall) has been published previously using this formalism in what we refer to as a standard nomogram. The calculations using the Loevinger formulas for calculating the P-32 activity necessary to achieve 200 Gy at the cyst wall is re-evaluated and compared to numerically computed results based on full Monte Carlo simulations (EGSnrc) and the dose-point-kernel (DPK) integration method. For cyst diameters greater than 1 cm, the new calculations agree well with previously published results (the standard nomogram) to within a few percents. However, for cyst diameters of less than 1 cm, it is shown that the standard nomogram results underestimate the therapeutic activity by a factor of similar to3 for very small diameters (similar to0.2 cm). New tables based on our calculations are presented and the sources of discrepancies are identified. It is concluded that the new set of data based on our calculations should replace the standard nomogram to administer accurately the target dose to the cyst wall for the smaller diameter cysts (< 1 cm).

Compensatory changes were observed in glycine, glutamate, and inositols in the brain stem, but not the spinal cord, of chronic morphine-treated rats. In spinal cord, increases were detected in lactate and N-acetyl-aspartate (NAA), suggesting that there is anaerobic glycolysis, plasma membrane damage, and altered pH preferentially in the spinal cord of chronic morphine-treated rats.

Over the last decade, increasing evidence suggests that hyperammonemia leads to alterations in the glutamatergic neurotransmitter system. Studies utilizing in vivo and in vitro models of hyperammonemia reveal significant changes in brain glutamate levels, glutamate uptake and glutamate receptor function. Extracellular brain glutamate levels are consistently increased in rat models of acute liver failure. Furthermore, glutamate transport studies in both cultured neurons and astrocytes demonstrate a significant suppression in the high affinity uptake of glutamate following exposure to ammonia. Reductions in NMDA and non-NMDA glutamate receptor sites in animal models of acute liver failure suggest a compensatory decrease in receptor levels in the wake of rising extracellular levels of glutamate. Ammonia exposure also has significant effects on metabotropic glutamate receptor activation with implications, although less clear, that may relate to the brain edema and seizures associated with clinical hyperammonemic pathologies. Therapeutic measures aimed at these targets could result in effective measures for the prevention of CNS consequences in hyperammonemic syndromes. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.
