In rats working for electrical stimulation of the medial forebrain bundle, we assessed the effect of GBR-12909 (1-[2-[bis(4-fluorophenyl)methoxy]ethyl]-4-[3-phenylpropyl]piperazine), a specific blocker of the dopamine transporter. Operant performance was measured as a function of the strength and cost of electrical stimulation. GBR-12909 increased the opportunity cost most subjects were willing to pay for a reward of a given intensity. However, this effect was smaller than that produced by a regimen of cocaine administration that drove similar increases in nucleus accumbens (NAc) dopamine levels in unstimulated rats. Delivery of rewarding stimulation to drug-treated rats caused an additional increase in dopamine concentration in the NAc shell in cocaine-treated, but not GBR-12909-treated, rats. These behavioral and neurochemical differences may reflect blockade of the norepinephrine transporter by cocaine but not by GBR-12909. Whereas the effect of psychomotor stimulants on ICSS has long been attributed to dopaminergic action at early stages of the reward pathway, the results reported here imply that increased dopamine tone boosts reward pursuit by acting at or beyond the output of the circuitry that temporally and spatially summates the output of the directly stimulated neurons underlying ICSS. The observed enhancement of reward seeking could be attributable to a decrease in the value of competing behaviors, a decrease in subjective effort costs, or an increase in reward-system gain.

Genetic defects in NPHP gene products that localize to cilia and centrosomes defined them as "ciliopathies.'' However, disease mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we identify by whole-exome resequencing, mutations of MRE11, ZNF423, and CEP164 as causing NPHP-RC. All three genes function within the DNA damage response (DDR) pathway. We demonstrate that, upon induced DNA damage, the NPHP-RC proteins ZNF423, CEP164, and NPHP10 colocalize to nuclear foci positive for TIP60, known to activate ATM at sites of DNA damage. We show that knockdown of CEP164 or ZNF423 causes sensitivity to DNA damaging agents and that cep164 knockdown in zebrafish results in dysregulated DDR and an NPHP-RC phenotype. Our findings link degenerative diseases of the kidney and retina, disorders of increasing prevalence, to mechanisms of DDR.

Early life insults include abnormalities of cortical development, hypoxic-ischemic injury and prolonged febrile seizures. To study epileptogenesis, we have developed a two-hit model of MTLE characterized by two early-life insults: a freeze lesion-induced cortical malformation at post-natal day 1 (P1), and a prolonged hyperthermic seizure (HS) at P10. As early life stressors lead to sexual dimorphism in both acute response and long-term outcome, we hypothesized that our model could lead to gender-based differences in acute stress response and long-term risk of developing MTLE. Male and female pups underwent a freeze-lesion induced cortical microgyrus at P1 and were exposed to HS at P10. Animals were monitored by video-EEG from P90 to P120. Pre and post-procedure plasma corticosterone levels were used to measure stress response at P1 and P10. To confirm the role of sex steroids, androgenized female pups received daily testosterone injections to the mother pre-natally and post-natally for nine days while undergoing both insults. We demonstrated that after both insults females did not develop MTLE while all males did. This correlated with a rise in corticosterone levels at P1 following the lesion in males only. Interestingly, all androgenized females showed a similar rise in corticosterone at P1, and also developed MTLE. Moreover, we found that the cortical lesion significantly decreased the latency to generalized convulsion during hyperthermia at P10 in both genders. The cortical dysplasia volumes at adulthood were also similar between male and female individuals. Our data demonstrate sexual dimorphism in long-term vulnerability to develop epilepsy in the lesion + hyperthermia animal model of MTLE and suggest that the response to early-life stress at P1 contributes significantly to epileptogenesis in a gender-specific manner.

Subgroup-specific structural variation across 1,000 medulloblastoma genomes	NATURE			English	Article							HEDGEHOG PATHWAY INHIBITOR; COPY-NUMBER ALTERATION; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; ALPHA-SYNUCLEIN; HUMAN CANCERS; BETA FAMILY; SYNPHILIN-1; PROTEIN; MYC; CHILDHOOD	Medulloblastoma, the most common malignant paediatric brain tumour, is currently treated with nonspecific cytotoxic therapies including surgery, whole-brain radiation, and aggressive chemotherapy. As medulloblastoma exhibits marked intertumoural heterogeneity, with at least four distinct molecular variants, previous attempts to identify targets for therapy have been underpowered because of small samples sizes. Here we report somatic copy number aberrations (SCNAs) in 1,087 unique medulloblastomas. SCNAs are common in medulloblastoma, and are predominantly subgroup-enriched. The most common region of focal copy number gain is a tandem duplication of SNCAIP, a gene associated with Parkinson's disease, which is exquisitely restricted to Group 4 alpha. Recurrent translocations of PVT1, including PVT1-MYC and PVT1-NDRG1, that arise through chromothripsis are restricted to Group 3. Numerous targetable SCNAs, including recurrent events targeting TGF-beta signalling in Group 3, and NF-kappa B signalling in Group 4, suggest future avenues for rational, targeted therapy.

It is the most common malignant brain tumour in children, and shows tremendous biological and clinical heterogeneity(1). Despite recent treatment advances, approximately 40% of children experience tumour recurrence, and 30% will die from their disease. Those who survive often have a significantly reduced quality of life. Four tumour subgroups with distinct clinical, biological and genetic profiles are currently identified(2,3). WNT tumours, showing activated wingless pathway signalling, carry a favourable prognosis under current treatment regimens(4). SHH tumours show hedgehog pathway activation, and have an intermediate prognosis(2). Group 3 and 4 tumours are molecularly less well characterized, and also present the greatest clinical challenges(2,3,5). The full repertoire of genetic events driving this distinction, however, remains unclear. Here we describe an integrative deep-sequencing analysis of 125 tumour-normal pairs, conducted as part of the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) PedBrain Tumor Project. Tetraploidy was identified as a frequent early event in Group 3 and 4 tumours, and a positive correlation between patient age and mutation rate was observed. Several recurrent mutations were identified, both in known medulloblastoma-related genes (CTNNB1, PTCH1, MLL2, SMARCA4) and in genes not previously linked to this tumour (DDX3X, CTDNEP1, KDM6A, TBR1), often in subgroup-specific patterns. RNA sequencing confirmed these alterations, and revealed the expression of what are, to our knowledge, the first medulloblastoma fusion genes identified. Chromatin modifiers were frequently altered across all subgroups. These findings enhance our understanding of the genomic complexity and heterogeneity underlying medulloblastoma, and provide several potential targets for new therapeutics, especially for Group 3 and 4 patients.

Curcumin ameliorates hepatic fibrosis in type 2 diabetes mellitus - insights into its mechanisms of action	BRITISH JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						curcumin; hepatic fibrosis; hepatic stellate cells; type 2 diabetes; RAGE	STELLATE CELLS; IN-VITRO; ACTIVATION; EXPRESSION; RECEPTOR; GENE; INHIBITION; DISEASE; GROWTH; TISSUE	A wide variety of beneficial effects have been attributed to curcumin, a major polyphenol from the golden spice Curcuma longa known as turmeric, including amelioration of severe complications of type 2 diabetes such as hepatic fibrosis, retinopathy, neuropathy and nephropathy. In the present issue of BJP, Lin and colleagues reveal new mechanisms by which curcumin inhibits the activation of hepatic stellate cells in vitro, a hallmark of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis and hepatic fibrogenesis associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus. They demonstrated that curcumin suppresses the advanced glycation end-products (AGEs)-mediated induction of the receptor for AGEs (RAGE) gene expression by increasing PPAR gamma activity and stimulating de novo synthesis of glutathione. As a result, downstream elements of RAGE-activated pathways are inhibited, which prevents oxidative stress, inflammation and hepatic stellate cell activation. This report suggests that curcumin may have potential as an anti-fibrotic agent in type 2 diabetes and opens the door to the evaluation of curcumin therapeutic effects in liver conditions of different aetiology and in other disorders linked to the impairment of PPAR gamma activity, such as obesity and atherosclerosis.

Analysis of the SORT1 gene in familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis	NEUROBIOLOGY OF AGING			English	Article						Genetics; Neuromuscular disease; Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis	MUTATIONS; PROTEIN; PROGRANULIN; TDP-43; FUS	Background: Substantial efforts have been deployed in the past decade to identify the genetic causes of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and we hypothesized here that mutations in SORT1 or aberrant SORT1 splicing reduce progranulin level and promote neurodegeneration. Methods: We sequenced the coding exons of SORT1 in a cohort of 112 unrelated individuals with familial ALS. We also tested for aberrant SORT1 splicing by RT-PCR using RNA samples from cell lines expressing six different ALS-associated TARDBP mutations. Results: We identified one unique missense and two unique silent mutations in our cohort. None are predicted to have functional effects. No aberrant SORT1 splicing event was observed. Conclusions: SORT1 mutations are not a common cause of familial ALS, and the influence of TARDBP mutations on SORT1 splicing still needs to be clarified. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

In this paper we focus primarily on studies carried out in rats to describe the changes in the maternal brain that enable the dam to meet the energetic demands of her offspring. In rats, providing milk for their litter is associated with a dramatic increase in caloric intake, a reduction in energy expenditure and changes in the pattern of energy utilization as well as storage. These behavioral and physiological adaptations result, in part, from alterations in the central pathways controlling energy balance. Differences in circulating levels of metabolic hormones such as leptin, ghrelin and insulin as well as in responsiveness to these signals between lactating and nonlactating animals, contribute to the modifications in energy balance pathways seen postpartum. Suckling stimulation from the pups both directly, and through the hormonal state that it induces in the mother, plays a key role in facilitating these adaptations.

The technique's simplicity, lower cost and applicability to children have contributed to its popularity. However, the translation of DOI to clinically relevant scenarios has lagged. Poor quantification of local hemodynamic changes based on optical signals remains a major hurdle and significant efforts are still being pursued to better understand how to recover accurate images of functional activation and generate statistical maps, and to identify the limitations of DOI. This paper reviews the underlying principles of brain DOI and applications that may find a niche in the clinic.

Preclinical and clinical studies have established that a dysfunction of serotonin (5-HT) neurotransmission is a common hallmark in major depression and drugs acting on the 5-HT system have antidepressant properties. In the past 15 years, the development of knockout mice showing a depressive-like or resilience-like phenotype have allowed us to better understand the complex relationship between genes, behaviour and the 5-HT system in mood disorders. The present review revises several knockout mice genotypes with 'mood' alteration and analyses how 5-HT firing activity, measured with electrophysiological techniques, is impaired after a gene manipulation. The behavior and electrophysiology data from 5-HT transporter (5HTT), 5-HT1A, 5-HT4, the neurokinin 1 (NK1) receptor, fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) and the TWIK-1 related K+ (TREK-1) channel knockout mice are here analysed. Interestingly, a correlation between 5-HT firing rate and depressive/resilience phenotypes can be established in these different knockouts. Furthermore, findings in knockout mice have been successfully translated to humans, and findings from human studies have helped to design and generate knockout mice to explore new hypotheses of the etiology of human depression. The correlation of 5-HT activity and behavior could be a predictor factor for understanding the role of receptors, channels and enzymes in depression, and could be used also to assess the potential antidepressive effects of novel drugs.

Indigenous children living nearby plantations with chlorpyrifos-treated bags have elevated 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol (TCPy) urinary concentrations	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Children; Pesticides; Chlorpyrifos; Biomarkers; Banana; Developing countries	PASSIVE AIR SAMPLERS; PESTICIDE EXPOSURE; ORGANOPHOSPHORUS PESTICIDES; MASS-SPECTROMETRY; HUMAN VOLUNTEERS; NEURODEVELOPMENT; NEUROTOXICITY; METABOLITES; ENVIRONMENT; MECHANISMS	Background: The US Environmental Protection Agency voluntary phased-out residential use of chlorpyrifos in 2001. In contrast, in Costa Rica, chlorpyrifos-treated bags are increasingly used to protect banana and plantain fruits from insects and to fulfill product standards, even in populated areas. Objectives: To evaluate children's exposure to chlorpyrifos in villages situated nearby banana plantations and plantain farms in Costa Rica. Methods: The study targeted two villages with use of chlorpyrifos-treated bags in nearby banana plantations and plantain farms and one village with mainly organic production. For 140 children from these villages, mostly indigenous Ngabe and Bribri, parent-interviews and urine samples (n=207) were obtained. Urinary 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol (TCPy) levels were measured as a biomarker for chlorpyrifos exposure. In the banana and plantain village also environmental contamination to chlorpyrifos was explored. Results: Children from the banana and plantain villages had statistically significant higher urinary TCPy concentrations than children from the referent village: 2.6 and 2.2 versus 1.3 mu g/g creatinine, respectively. Chlorpyrifos was detected in 30% of the environmental samples as well as in 92% of the hand/foot wash samples. For more than half of the children their estimated intake exceeded the US EPA chronic population adjusted dose. For some, the acute population adjusted dose and the chronic reference dose were also exceeded. Conclusions: Our results suggest that children living nearby plantations with chlorpyrifos-treated bags are exposed to chlorpyrifos levels that may affect their health.

The goal of this study was to identify potential mediators of brain noradrenergic dysfunction in MDD. Bone morphogenetic protein 7 (BMP7), a member of the transforming growth factor-beta superfamily, is a critical mediator of noradrenergic neuron differentiation during development and has neurotrophic and neuroprotective effects on mature catecholaminergic neurons. Real-time PCR of reversed transcribed RNA isolated from homogenates of LC tissue from 12 matched pairs of MDD subjects and psychiatrically normal control subjects revealed low levels of BMP7 gene expression in MDD. No differences in gene expression levels of other members of the BMP family were observed in the LC, and BMP7 gene expression was normal in the prefrontal cortex and amygdala in MDD subjects. Laser capture microdissection of noradrenergic neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes from the LC revealed that BMP7 gene expression was highest in LC astrocytes relative to the other cell types, and that the MDD-associated reduction in BMP7 gene expression was limited to astrocytes. Rats exposed to chronic social defeat exhibited a similar reduction in BMP7 gene expression in the LC. BMP7 has unique developmental and trophic actions on catecholamine neurons and these findings suggest that reduced astrocyte support for pontine LC neurons may contribute to pathology of brain noradrenergic neurons in MDD.

The 2010 McDonald criteria simplified MRI requirements, and newly proposed that the criteria are also suitable for the diagnosis of pediatric MS. Methods: In a national prospective incident cohort study of children with acute demyelination observed for a minimum of 24 months, baseline and serial clinical and MRI examinations were used to retrospectively evaluate the 2010 and 2005 McDonald criteria using clinically relapsing disease as the gold standard. Results: Of 212 eligible participants, 34 experienced 2 or more clinical attacks, 58 met the 2010 criteria, and 42 met 2005 McDonald criteria. The 2010 criteria demonstrated high sensitivity (100%), specificity (86%), positive predictive value (76%), and negative predictive value (100%) for children older than 11 years with nonacute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) presentations, as did the 2005 McDonald criteria. In younger children with a non-ADEM presentation, PPV of the 2010 criteria was only 55%. None of the 50 children with ADEM met clinical criteria for MS, but 10 met 2010 and 4 met 2005 criteria. Interpretation: Both 2005 and 2010 McDonald criteria identify children with relapsingremitting MS, although caution is suggested when applying these criteria in younger children. The 2010 McDonald criteria are simple and enable an early diagnosis of MS, but are not suited for application in the context of ADEM-like presentations. ANN NEUROL 2012;72:211223.

Automated region of interest analysis of dynamic Ca2+ signals in image sequences. Am J Physiol Cell Physiol 303: C236-C243, 2012. First published April 25, 2012; doi:10.1152/ajpcell.00016.2012.-Ca2+ signals are commonly measured using fluorescent Ca2+ indicators and microscopy techniques, but manual analysis of Ca2+ measurements is time consuming and subject to bias. Automated region of interest (ROI) detection algorithms have been employed for identification of Ca2+ signals in one-dimensional line scan images, but currently there is no process to integrate acquisition and analysis of ROIs within two-dimensional time lapse image sequences. Therefore we devised a novel algorithm for rapid ROI identification and measurement based on the analysis of best-fit ellipses assigned to signals within noise-filtered image sequences. This algorithm was implemented as a plugin for ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). We evaluated the ability of our algorithm to detect synthetic Gaussian signal pulses embedded in background noise. The algorithm placed ROIs very near to the center of a range of signal pulses, resulting in mean signal amplitude measurements of 99.06 +/- 4.11% of true amplitude values. As a practical application, we evaluated both agonist-induced Ca2+ responses in cultured endothelial cell monolayers, and subtle basal endothelial Ca2+ dynamics in opened artery preparations. Our algorithm enabled comprehensive measurement of individual and localized cellular responses within cultured cell monolayers. It also accurately identified characteristic Ca2+ transients, or Ca2+ pulsars, within the endothelium of intact mouse mesenteric arteries and revealed the distribution of this basal Ca2+ signal modality to be non-Gaussian with respect to amplitude, duration, and spatial spread. We propose that large-scale statistical evaluations made possible by our algorithm will lead to a more efficient and complete characterization of physiologic Ca2+-dependent signaling.

Correct diagnosis is challenging for emergency physicians (EPs) due to its variable clinical picture, as well as its lack of diagnostic biological markers. Objectives: To raise awareness among EPs regarding FHM's diverse clinical picture, and to highlight FHM's diagnostic criteria to facilitate an accurate and timely diagnosis of FHM in patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with indicative symptomatology. Case Report: A 24-year-old male student presented to the ED complaining of dizziness, general weakness, and blurred vision that had developed the previous night. The initial physical examination revealed drowsiness, slow speech production, and slight weakness with paresthesia in all limbs. Detailed communication with the patient's aunt revealed that he had experienced several similar attacks since the age of 12 years, and that there was also an extensive family history of the same symptoms. In addition, 2 h after arrival, the patient experienced severe throbbing headache, vomiting, severe dysphasia, and the weakness shifted to the right side. A computed tomography scan of the brain showed no anomalies. He was admitted with a tentative diagnosis of FHM. Conclusion: A diagnosis of FHM should be considered if the patient's clinical features include headache and weakness, with a family history of similar symptomatology. However, atypical symptoms of FHM may present as recurrent episodes of unexplained encephalopathy. Crucial elements for making an accurate and timely diagnosis of FHM include a detailed knowledge of weakness-related diseases and an ability to consider FHM in the differential diagnosis, as well as obtaining a thorough family history with repeated neurologic assessments.

Pitfalls in the dipolar model for the neocortical EEG sources. J Neurophysiol 108: 956-975, 2012. First published April 25, 2012; doi: 10.1152/jn.00098.2011.-For about six decades, primary current sources of the electroencephalogram (EEG) have been assumed dipolar in nature. In this study, we used electro-physiological recordings from anesthetized Wistar rats undergoing repeated whisker deflections to revise the biophysical foundations of the EEG dipolar model. In a first experiment, we performed three-dimensional recordings of extracellular potentials from a large portion of the barrel field to estimate intracortical multipolar moments generated either by single spiking neurons (i.e., pyramidal cells, PC; spiny stellate cells, SS) or by populations of them while experiencing synchronized postsynaptic potentials. As expected, backpropagating spikes along PC dendrites caused dipolar field components larger in the direction perpendicular to the cortical surface (49.7 +/- 22.0 nA.mm). In agreement with the fact that SS cells have "close-field" configurations, their dipolar moment at any direction was negligible. Surprisingly, monopolar field components were detectable both at the level of single units (i.e., -11.7 +/- 3.4 nA for PC) and at the mesoscopic level of mixed neuronal populations receiving extended synaptic inputs within either a cortical column (-0.44 +/- 0.20 mu A) or a 2.5-m(3)-voxel volume (-3.32 +/- 1.20 mu A). To evaluate the relationship between the macroscopically defined EEG equivalent dipole and the mesoscopic intracortical multipolar moments, we performed concurrent recordings of high-resolution skull EEG and laminar local field potentials. From this second experiment, we estimated the time-varying EEG equivalent dipole for the entire barrel field using either a multiple dipole fitting or a distributed type of EEG inverse solution. We demonstrated that mesoscopic multipolar components are altogether absorbed by any equivalent dipole in both types of inverse solutions. We conclude that the primary current sources of the EEG in the neocortex of rodents are not precisely represented by a single equivalent dipole and that the existence of monopolar components must be also considered at the mesoscopic level.

This requires encoded information to persist once important predictors are extracted, while also being modifiable in response to changes within the environment. Memory reconsolidation may allow stored information to be modified in response to related experience. However, there are many boundary conditions beyond which reconsolidation may not occur. One interpretation of these findings is that the event triggering memory retrieval must contain new information about a familiar stimulus in order to induce reconsolidation. Presently, the mechanisms that affect the likelihood of reconsolidation occurring under these conditions are not well understood. Here we speculate on a number of systems that may play a role in protecting memory from being destabilized during retrieval. We conclude that few memories may enter a state in which they cannot be modified. Rather, metaplasticity mechanisms may serve to alter the specific reactivation cues necessary to destabilize a memory. This might imply that destabilization mechanisms can differ depending on learning conditions. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Finnie, Peter S.

Liver transplantation for symptomatic liver metastases of neuroendocrine tumours	CURRENT ONCOLOGY			English	Article						Liver transplantation; neuroendocrine tumour; liver metastases	ENDOCRINE TUMORS; CONSENSUS GUIDELINES; UNKNOWN PRIMARY; MANAGEMENT; SURVIVAL; FOREGUT; HINDGUT; MIDGUT	Numerous reports have demonstrated that liver transplantation for neuroendocrine tumour metastasis is feasible. However, perioperative risks and long-term recurrences remain significant concerns. When liver transplantation is combined with extensive intestinal or pancreatic resection, the risk is particularly high. We report our institutional experience of liver transplantations performed for liver metastases secondary to neuroendocrine tumours, and in combination with a review of the literature, we propose a set of selection criteria. The key points include unresectable hepatic metastases of neuroendocrine origin, absence of extrahepatic metastases, symptomatic disease that is refractory to medical therapy, a Ki-67 level less than 2%, previous resection of the primary disease, and previous therapy for metastatic neuroendocrine tumour. In our experience, the patient in the first case had, post-transplantation, rapid disease progression because of an unidentified primary, and patient in the second case had primary non-function of the liver graft, requiring urgent re-transplantation. More recently, two liver transplantations were successfully performed. The indications were, in the first case, refractory hormonal secretion and, in the other, secondary biliary cirrhosis attributable to hepatic artery therapy with tumour in situ. Subclinical and stable recurrent disease has been detected by scintigraphy in the mesentery and lumbar spine in the former patient. A mesenteric recurrence developed in the latter patient 2 years post transplantation and was subsequently completely resected. At 4 and 5 years post transplantation, both patients are symptom-free. Recurrence after transplantation remains a significant concern, even with careful patient selection, but recurrences may remain indolent. If recurrences are progressive, they may still be amenable to additional medical or surgical therapy. A national or international consensus between oncologists and transplant specialists regarding the indications for liver transplantation is vital, because future progress will depend on careful patient selection and prospective study.

After subcortical stroke affecting the pyramidal tract (PT), an abnormal pattern of bilateral activity develops in M1. With this prospective longitudinal study, we aimed to determine whether a morphological correlate of poststroke disinhibition could be measured within 20 days and 6 months of PT stroke. Using diffusion tensor imaging with tractography, we delineated transcallosal motor fibers (CMF) in nine PT stroke patients, six patients with subcortical infarct not affecting the PT (NonPT) and six transient ischemic attack patients. We compared changes in CMF fractional anisotropy ratios (rFA) with rFA in a distinct bundle of callosal occipital fibers (COF). At the initial time point, there were no significant differences in rFA between groups and fiber bundles. At follow-up, PT-group rFA(CMF) was significantly lower than PT-group rFA(COF) and NonPT-group rFA(CMF). PT-group rFA(CMF) decreased over time and correlated with rFA of the PT (rFA(PT)) retrograde to the infarct at 6 months. Our data suggest a progressive degenerative transsynaptic effect of PT stroke on CMF, which could be a morphological correlate of transcallosal disinhibition.

Recently, we reported evidence of lower normalized C-11-AMT trapping in the orbitofrontal cortex (OBFC) of subjects meeting the criteria for an impulsive and/or aggressive behavioral phenotype. In this study, we examined whether part of the variance in OBFC serotonin synthesis is related to polymorphisms of the gene that encodes for the indoleamine's rate-limiting enzyme in the brain, tryptophan hydroxylase-2 (TPH2). In all, 46 healthy controls had PET C-11-AMT scans and were genotyped for 11 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) distributed across the TPH2 gene and its 5' upstream region. Several TPH2 SNPs were associated with lower normalized blood-to-brain clearance of C-11-AMT in the OBFC. Dose-effect relationships were found for two variants (rs6582071 and rs4641527, respectively, located in the 5' upstream region and intron 1) that have previously been associated with suicide. Associations in the OBFC remained statistically significant in a mixed larger sample of patients and controls. These results suggest that in humans, genetic factors might partly account for variations in serotonin synthesis in the OBFC.

However, the symptomatic effects of caffeine in PD have not been adequately evaluated. Methods: We conducted a 6-week randomized controlled trial of caffeine in PD to assess effects upon daytime somnolence, motor severity, and other nonmotor features. Patients with PD with daytime somnolence (Epworth > 10) were given caffeine 100 mg twice daily x 3 weeks, then 200 mg twice daily x 3 weeks, or matching placebo. The primary outcome was the Epworth Sleepiness Scale score. Secondary outcomes included motor severity, sleep markers, fatigue, depression, and quality of life. Effects of caffeine were analyzed with Bayesian hierarchical models, adjusting for study site, baseline scores, age, and sex. Results: Of 61 patients, 31 were randomized to placebo and 30 to caffeine. On the primary intention-to-treat analysis, caffeine resulted in a nonsignificant reduction in Epworth Sleepiness Scale score (-1.71 points; 95% confidence interval [CI] -3.57, 0.13). However, somnolence improved on the Clinical Global Impression of Change (+0.64; 0.16, 1.13, intention-to-treat), with significant reduction in Epworth Sleepiness Scale score on per-protocol analysis (-1.97; -3.87, -0.05). Caffeine reduced the total Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale score (-4.69 points; -7.7, -1.6) and the objective motor component (-3.15 points; -5.50, -0.83). Other than modest improvement in global health measures, there were no changes in quality of life, depression, or sleep quality. Adverse events were comparable in caffeine and placebo groups. Conclusions: Caffeine provided only equivocal borderline improvement in excessive somnolence in PD, but improved objective motor measures. These potential motor benefits suggest that a larger long-term trial of caffeine is warranted. Classification of evidence: This study provides Class I evidence that caffeine, up to 200 mg BID for 6 weeks, had no significant benefit on excessive daytime sleepiness in patients with PD.

The neurotoxicology literature continues to confuse the terms sex (biological attributes) and gender (socially constructed roles and behavior) and the words are still used interchangeably. Throughout the lifespan, sex and gender are in interaction and both may play a role in influencing exposure and effect. Studies that have examined both males and females, provide evidence for sex differences in toxicokinetics and responses to neurotoxic assault as well as gender differences in exposure patterns, biomarkers of exposure, neurobehavioral performance and social consequences. Integrating sex and gender considerations into research in neurotoxicology would not only provide us with a better understanding of the mechanisms and pathways that lead to toxic assault, but also provide a means to improve preventive intervention strategies.

The first contribution highlighted the usefulness of functional neuroimaging of the central nervous system (CNS) to evaluate cognitive as well as motor deficits in Mn-exposed welders. The second dealt with results of two prospective studies in Mn-exposed workers or welders showing that after decrease of Mn exposure the outcome of reversibility in adverse CNS effects may differ for motor and cognitive function and, in addition the issue of plasma Mn as a reliable biomarker for Mn exposure in welders has been addressed. The third presentation showed a brief overview of the results of an ongoing study assessing the relationship between environmental airborne Mn exposure and neurological or neuropsychological effects in adult Ohio residents living near a Mn point source. The fourth paper focused on the association between blood Mn and neurodevelopment in early childhood which seems to be sensitive to both low and high Mn concentrations. The fifth contribution gave an overview of six studies indicating a negative impact of excess environmental Mn exposure from air and drinking water on children's cognitive performance, with special attention to hair Mn as a potential biomarker of exposure. These studies highlight a series of questions about Mn neurotoxicity with respect to cognitive processes, forms and routes of exposure, adequate biomarkers of exposure, gender differences, susceptibility and exposure limits with regard to age.

This symposium brought together participants to explore the neurotoxic effects of pesticides across the lifespan. Endpoints examined included neurobehavioral, affective and neurodevelopmental outcomes among occupational (both adolescent and adult workers) and nonoccupational populations (children). The symposium discussion highlighted many challenges for researchers concerned with the prevention of neurotoxic illness due to pesticides and generated a number of directions for further research and policy interventions for the protection of human health, highlighting the importance of examining potential long-term effects across the lifespan arising from early adolescent, childhood or prenatal exposure.

However, to understand the origins of human tool behavior, comparisons with solely chimpanzees are insufficient, lacking the power to identify derived traits. Moreover, tool use is unlikely a unitary phenomenon. Large-scale comparative analyses provide an alternative and suggest that tool use co-evolves with a suite of cognitive traits.

The selective neuropeptide Y Y-5 agonist [cPP(1-7),NPY19-23,Ala(31),Aib(32),Gln(34)]hPP differently modulates emotional processes and body weight in the rat	BEHAVIOURAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Anxiety; Corticosterone; Depression; Neuropeptide Y; Olfactory bulbectomy	OLFACTORY BULBECTOMIZED RAT; FORCED SWIM TEST; CONTRASTING GROOMING PHENOTYPES; DEPRESSION-LIKE BEHAVIOR; FOOD-INTAKE; GENE-EXPRESSION; RECEPTOR ANTAGONIST; SOCIAL-INTERACTION; ANXIETY DISORDERS; NPY	The neuropeptide V (NPY) has been suggested to act as a major regulator of emotional processes and body weight. The full spectrum of biological effects of this peptide is mediated by at least four classes of receptors known as the Y-1, Y-2, Y-4, and Y-5 subtypes. However, the respective contribution of each of these receptor subtypes, especially the Y-5 subtype, in emotional processes is still mostly unknown. In the present study, we investigated the effect of long term administration of a selective Y-5 agonist [cPP(1-7),NPY19-23,Ala(31),Aib(32),Gln(34)]hPP on emotional processes and body weight using two rat models of emotional dysfunctions, the corticosterone (CORT)-induced anxiety model as well as the olfactory bulbectomized (OBX) model of depression and anxiety in Wistar and Sprague-Dawley rats, respectively. The sub-chronic administration of the Y5 agonist reversed the high levels of locomotion, rearing and grooming in the open field test and the impaired social activity induced by OBX, while increased the percentage of entries and time in the open arm of the elevated plus maze in CORT-treated rats. Furthermore, this Y-5 agonist increased body weight in both strains of control rats. These data further demonstrate that Y-5(-) receptors are not only involved in the control of body weight but also mediate emotional processing under challenged conditions. Thus, the pharmacotherapeutic administration of a Y-5 agonist could be considered as a potentially novel strategy to alleviate some forms of anxiety and depression in humans. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

We reviewed safety data from nonclinical studies and clinical trials (phases 1, 2A, and 3) with fidaxomicin. In nonclinical studies, fidaxomicin was administered orally at approximately 1 g/kg/d to dogs for up to 3 months with no significant target-organ toxicities observed. A total of 728 adults have received oral fidaxomicin in clinical trials to date: 116 healthy volunteers and 612 patients with C. difficile infection. In phase 3 clinical trials, fidaxomicin was well tolerated, with a safety profile comparable with oral vancomycin. There were no differences in the incidence of death or serious adverse events between the 2 drugs. Fidaxomicin appears to be well tolerated. Continued monitoring of adverse events in the postmarketing setting will provide additional information about the full safety profile of fidaxomicin.

However, higher integration of the neurostimulator becomes increasingly necessary for miniaturization purposes, power consumption reduction, and for increasing the number of stimulation channels. As a first step towards total integration, we present in this paper the design of a highly-integrated neurostimulator that can be assembled on a 21-mm diameter printed circuit board. The prototype is based on three custom integrated circuits fabricated in High-Voltage (HV) CMOS technology, and a low-power small-scale commercially available FPGA. Using a step-down approach where the inductive voltage is left free up to 20 V, the inductive power and data recovery front-end is fully integrated. In particular, the front-end includes a bridge rectifier, a 20-V voltage limiter, an adjustable series regulator (5 to 12 V), a switched-capacitor step-down DC/DC converter (1: 3, 1: 2, or 2: 3 ratio), as well as data recovery. Measurements show that the DC/DC converter achieves more than 86% power efficiency while providing around 3.9-V from a 12-V input at 1-mA load, 1: 3 conversion ratio, and 50-kHz switching frequency. With such efficiency, the proposed step-down inductive power recovery topology is more advantageous than its conventional step-up counterpart. Experimental results confirm good overall functionality of the system.

A sample of 38 patients with BPD and matched community comparison participants completed event-contingent record forms after each significant interaction for a 20-day period. Multilevel models showed that, controlling for baseline levels of depressive symptoms and neuroticism, as well as lagged negative affect, event-level elevations in perceived inferiority and emotional insecurity were related to more negative affect in both groups. Event-level perceived inferiority was more strongly associated with negative affect in patients with BPD who reported higher levels of self-criticism, while event-level perceived emotional insecurity was more strongly associated with negative affect in patients with BPD who reported higher levels of dependency. No significant interactions emerged for the comparison group. These findings further our understanding of differences among patients with BPD and support the application of personality-vulnerability or diathesis-stress models in predicting negative affect in BPD. Results have implications for the design of therapies for patients with BPD.	[Kopala-Sibley, Daniel C.; Zuroff, David C.; Moskowitz, D.

AV-45-A16 Study Grp	Cerebral PET with florbetapir compared with neuropathology at autopsy for detection of neuritic amyloid-beta plaques: a prospective cohort study	LANCET NEUROLOGY			English	Article							POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; PITTSBURGH COMPOUND-B; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; F 18; ASSOCIATION; RADIOLIGAND; PATHOLOGY; DEMENTIA; ADULTS	Background Results of previous studies have shown associations between PET imaging of amyloid plaques and amyloid-beta pathology measured at autopsy. However, these studies were small and not designed to prospectively measure sensitivity or specificity of amyloid PET imaging against a reference standard. We therefore prospectively compared the sensitivity and specificity of amyloid PET imaging with neuropathology at autopsy. Methods This study was an extension of our previous imaging-to-autopsy study of participants recruited at 22 centres in the USA who had a life expectancy of less than 6 months at enrolment. Participants had autopsy within 2 years of PET imaging with florbetapir (F-18). For one of the primary analyses, the interpretation of the florbetapir scans (majority interpretation of five nuclear medicine physicians, who classified each scan as amyloid positive or amyloid negative) was compared with amyloid pathology (assessed according to the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease standards, and classed as amyloid positive for moderate or frequent plaques or amyloid negative for no or sparse plaques); correlation of the image analysis results with amyloid burden was tested as a coprimary endpoint. Correlation, sensitivity, and specificity analyses were also done in the subset of participants who had autopsy within 1 year of imaging as secondary endpoints. The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT 01447719 (original study NCT 00857415). Findings We included 59 participants (aged 47-103 years; cognitive status ranging from normal to advanced dementia). The sensitivity and specificity of florbetapir PET imaging for detection of moderate to frequent plaques were 92% (36 of 39; 95% CI 78-98) and 100% (20 of 20; 80-100%), respectively, in people who had autopsy within 2 years of PET imaging, and 96% (27 of 28; 80-100%) and 100% (18 of 18; 78-100%), respectively, for those who had autopsy within 1 year. Amyloid assessed semiquantitatively with florbetapir PET was correlated with the post-mortem amyloid burden in the participants who had an autopsy within 2 years (Spearman p=0.76; p<0.0001) and within 12 months between imaging and autopsy (0.79; p<0.0001). Interpretation The results of this study validate the binary visual reading method approved in the USA for clinical use with florbetapir and suggest that florbetapir could be used to distinguish individuals with no or sparse amyloid plaques from those with moderate to frequent plaques. Additional research is needed to understand the prognostic implications of moderate to frequent plaque density.

The aim was to evaluate patient-ventilator interaction in infants during NAVA as compared with conventional ventilation. METHODS: Infants were successively ventilated with NAVA, pressure control ventilation (PCV), and pressure support ventilation (PSV). Edi and ventilator pressure (Pvent) waveforms were compared and their variability was assessed by coefficients of variation. RESULTS: Ten patients (mean age 4.3 +/- 2.4 mo and weight 5.9 +/- 2.2 kg) were studied. In PCV and PSV, 4 +/- 4.6% and 6.5 +/- 7.7% of the neural efforts failed to trigger the ventilator. This did not occur during NAVA. Trigger delays were shorter with NAVA as compared with PCV and PSV (93 +/- 20 ms vs. 193 +/- 87 ms and 135 +/- 29 ms). During PCV and PSV, the ventilator cycled off before the end of neural inspiration in 12 +/- 13% and 21 +/- 19% of the breaths (0 +/- 0% during NAVA). During PCV and PSV, 24 +/- 11% and 25 +/- 9% of the neural breath cycle was asynchronous with the ventilator as compared with 11 +/- 3% with NAVA. A large variability was observed for Edi in all modes, which was transmitted into Pvent during NAVA (coefficient of variation: 24 +/- 8%) and not in PCV (coefficient of variation 2 +/- 1%) or PSV (2 +/- 2%). CONCLUSION: NAVA improves patient-ventilator interaction and delivers adequate ventilation with variable pressure in infants.

Additionally, HIV-1-infected patients with a low CD4+ T-lymphocyte count displayed lower concentrations of reduced glutathione (GSH), the main intracellular antioxidant molecule, and lower level of survival. To establish a correlation between increased concentrations of extracellular Vpr and an oxidative stress-induced phenotype, the U-87 MG astroglioma cell line has been used to determine the downstream effects induced by Vpr. Conditioned media obtained from the human endothelial kidney (HEK) 293 T cell line transfected either in the absence or presence of HIV-1 Vpr contained free Vpr. Exposure of U-87 MG to this conditioned media decreased intracellular levels of both adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and GSH. These observations were recapitulated using purified recombinant HIV-1 Vpr both in U-87 MG and primary human fetal astrocytes in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Vpr-induced oxidative stress could be partly restored by co-treatment with the antioxidant molecule N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC). In addition, free Vpr augmented production of reactive oxygen species due to an increase in the level of oxidized glutathione (GSSG). This event was almost entirely suppressed by treatment with an anti-Vpr antibody or co-treatment with NAC. These studies confirm a role of extracellular Vpr in impairing astrocytic levels of intracellular ATP and GSH. Studies are underway to better understand the intricate correlation between reductions in ATP and GSH metabolites and how they affect neuronal survival in end-stage disease. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

In drug-resistant temporal lobe epilepsy, resting functional magnetic resonance imaging studies have primarily employed region of interest approaches that preclude a comprehensive evaluation of large-scale functional interactions. In line with the distributed nature of structural damage in this condition, we set out to quantify connectivity across the entire range of resting networks. Furthermore, we assessed whether connectivity is driven by co-localized structural pathology. We obtained resting state, diffusion tensor and anatomical imaging data in 35 patients with temporal lobe epilepsy and 20 healthy subjects on a 3 T scanner. Resting state networks were identified using independent component analysis, which allows an objective whole-brain quantification of functional connectivity. We performed group comparisons before and after correcting for voxel-wise grey matter density. In addition, we identified voxel-wise associations between resting connectivity and white matter coherence indexed by fractional anisotropy. Compared with controls, patients showed altered (typically reduced) functional connectivity between the hippocampus, anterior temporal, precentral cortices and the default mode and sensorimotor networks. Reduced network integration of the hippocampus was explained by variations in grey matter density, while functional connectivity of the parahippocampus, and frontal and temporal neocortices showed atypical associations with white matter coherence within pathways carrying connections of these regions. Our multimodal imaging study suggests that in temporal lobe epilepsy, cortical atrophy and microstructural white matter damage impact functional resting connectivity.

There are no well-established predictors for pain development after thalamic stroke, and the role of different thalamic nuclei is unclear. Here, we used structural magnetic resonance imaging to identify the thalamic nuclei, specifically implicated in the generation of central post-stroke pain of thalamic origin. Lesions of 10 patients with central post-stroke pain of thalamic origin and 10 control patients with thalamic strokes without pain were identified as volumes of interest on magnetic resonance imaging data. Non-linear deformations were estimated to match each image with a high-resolution template and were applied to each volume of interest. By using a digital atlas of the thalamus, we elucidated the involvement of different nuclei with respect to each lesion. Patient and control volumes of interest were summed separately to identify unique areas of involvement. Voxelwise odds ratio maps were calculated to localize the anatomical site where lesions put patients at risk of developing central post-stroke pain of thalamic origin. In the patients with pain, mainly lateral and posterior thalamic nuclei were affected, whereas a more anterior-medial lesion pattern was evident in the controls. The lesions of 9 of 10 pain patients overlapped at the border of the ventral posterior nucleus and the pulvinar, coinciding with the ventrocaudalis portae nucleus. The lesions of this area showed an odds ratio of 81 in favour of developing thalamic pain. The high odds ratio at the ventral posterior nucleus-pulvinar border zone indicates that this area is crucial in the pathogenesis of thalamic pain and demonstrates the feasibility of identifying patients at risk of developing central post-stroke pain of thalamic origin early after thalamic insults. This provides a basis for pre-emptive treatment studies.

It comprises a group of diseases caused by mutations in genes involved in Schwann cells homeostasis and neuronal function that affect the peripheral nerves. So far mutations in more than 33 genes have been identified causing either the demyelinating form (CMT1) or the axonal form (CMT2). Genes involving a large variety of unrelated functions may lead to the same phenotype when mutated. Our review will focus on the common link between genes causing axonal phenotypes like MEN2, KIF1B, DYNC1H1, Rab7, TRPV4, ARSs, NEFL, HSPB1, MPZ, and HSPB8. While KIF1B and DYNC1H1, two genes coding for molecular motors, are directly linked to axonal transport, the involvement of the other CMT2-causing genes in this function is less obvious. However, the last years have seen a growing list of evidence demonstrating that intracellular trafficking and mitochondrial dynamics might be dysfunctional in CMT2, and these mechanisms might present a common link between dissimilar CMT2-causing genes. The involvement of impaired transport in the pathogenesis of other rare neurological diseases or recessive cum is also discussed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The effects of acute and chronic treatments with the 5-HT1B agonist, CP-94253 on 5-HT synthesis, in the FSL rats and the Hinders Resistant Line (FRL) controls were measured using alpha-[C-14]methyl-L-tryptophan (alpha-MTrp) autoradiography. CP-94253 (5 mg/kg), or an adequate volume of saline, was injected i.p. as a single dose in the acute experiment or delivered via the subcutaneously implanted osmotic minipump (5 mg/kg/day for 14 days) in the chronic experiment. The acute treatment with CP-94253 significantly decreased the synthesis in both the FRL and FSL rats, with a more widespread effect in the FRL rats. Chronic treatment with CP-94253 significantly decreased 5-HT synthesis in the FRL rats, while 5-HT synthesis in the FSL rats was significantly increased throughout the brain. In both the acute and chronic experiment, the FRL rats had higher brain 5-HT synthesis rates, relative to the FSL rats. The shift in the direction of the treatment effect from acute to chronic, using the 5-HT1B agonist, CP-94253, on 5-HT synthesis in the FSL model of depression, with an opposite effect on the control FRL rats, suggests the differential adaptation of the 5-HT system in the FSL and FRL rats to chronic stimulation of 5-HT1B receptors.

We performed exome sequencing in 3 families with MCAP or MPPH, and our initial observations were confirmed in exomes from 7 individuals with MCAP and 174 control individuals, as well as in 40 additional subjects with megalencephaly, using a combination of Sanger sequencing, restriction enzyme assays and targeted deep sequencing. We identified de novo germline or postzygotic mutations in three core components of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT pathway. These include 2 mutations in AKT3, 1 recurrent mutation in PIK3R2 in 11 unrelated families with MPPH and 15 mostly postzygotic mutations in PIK3CA in 23 individuals with MCAP and 1 with MPPH. Our data highlight the central role of PI3K-AKT signaling in vascular, limb and brain development and emphasize the power of massively parallel sequencing in a challenging context of phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity combined with postzygotic mosaicism.

We describe the pattern and correlates of executive dysfunction in 34 adolescents with MS on neuropsychological tests and the parent version of the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF). The adolescents with MS performed lower than age-matched controls in several areas of executive functioning, with 44 of patients being impaired on the Trail Making TestPart B. On the BRIEF, problems in working memory and planning/organization were identified in the patient group compared with controls, particularly in patients with a younger age at disease onset. Task performance and parent-ratings of EF skills were strongly related to whole brain and regional brain volume metrics and, to a lesser extent, T-2-weighted lesion volume. Working memory and attention switching are at greatest risk of impairment. Results support the inclusion of neuropsychological assessment alongside parent-report measures of EF skills in childhood-onset MS.

J	Lee, S; Zhang, J				Lee, SeungHwan; Zhang, Ji			Heterogeneity of macrophages in injured trigeminal nerves: Cytokine/chemokine expressing vs. phagocytic macrophages	BRAIN BEHAVIOR AND IMMUNITY			English	Article						Nerve injury; Macrophages; Cytokines/chemokines; Phagocytes and neuropathic pain	GENE-RELATED PEPTIDE; PERIPHERAL NERVOUS-SYSTEM; INDUCED NEUROPATHIC PAIN; RAT SCIATIC-NERVE; SPINAL-CORD; WALLERIAN DEGENERATION; GROWTH-FACTOR; T-LYMPHOCYTES; AXONAL DEGENERATION; NONNEURONAL CELLS	Background: Macrophages are important immune effector cells in both innate and adaptive immune responses. Injury to peripheral nerves triggers activation of resident macrophages and infiltration of haematogenous macrophages, which they play critical roles in Wallerian degeneration and neuropathic pain. As macrophages are able to change their phenotypes in response to environment cues, we attempt to identify distinct phenotypes of macrophages in injured nerves and to understand the potential contribution of each macrophage subpopulation to the genesis of neuropathic pain associated with nerve injury. Methods: Rat mental nerves (terminal branches of trigeminal nerve) were loosely ligated. Sensitivity to mechanical stimuli at the lower lip area was monitored using calibrated von Frey Hairs. We examined the expression pattern of Iba-1. MAC1 and ED1 which allow us to reveal the immunophenotypes of macrophages at different time points post-injury. Functional status of each macrophage subpopulation was further investigated by colocalization with cytokines/chemokines, myelin basic protein and MHC II antigen, which reflect respectively secretory, phagocytic and antigen presentation properties of activated macrophages. Results: Following nerve injury, a burst of Iba-1(+) macrophages was found in injured mental nerves. Among them, we detected two major immunophenotypes: MAC1(+) cytokines/chemokines secreting macrophages and ED1+ phagocytic macrophages. Small, round shaped MAC1(+) macrophages were distributed essentially around the lesion site and existed only at early time points. Large, irregular and foamy ED1(+) macrophages were found among damaged nerve fibers and they persisted for at least 3 months post-injury. Although ED1(+) macrophages did not secrete inflammatory mediators, they were able to express neurotransmitter CGRP and MHC II at later time points. In parallel, we observed that mechanical allodynia developed after the nerve ligation was at its lowest level within 1 month. Although slightly increased afterwards, the head escape threshold maintained significantly lower than before injury until 3 months. We suggest that MAC1(+) macrophages contribute to the initiation of neuropathic pain by releasing cytokines/chemokines, and ED1(+) macrophages may contribute in maintaining the hypersensitivity under other mechanisms. Conclusion: Our results highlighted the heterogeneity and the plasticity of macrophages in response to the injury and provided further information on their potential involvement in neuropathic pain. Exploring the full spectrum of macrophage phenotypes in injured nerve is necessary. Individual macrophage population may be selectively targeted by cell-specific intervention for an effective treatment of neuropathic pain. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

However, there is still a paucity of information on the ovarian reserve and efficacy of assisted reproduction treatment (ART) procedures in patients with cancer previously exposed to chemotherapy or radiotherapy. The aim of our study was to evaluate the ovarian reserve and ovarian response to IVF or in vitro maturation (IVM) treatment in women who had previously been treated with chemotherapy. In this retrospective cohort study, we compared 23 women with cancer who had undergone chemotherapy and subsequently underwent fertility treatment with IVF (n 14) or IVM (n 9). In the IVF group, patients mostly had hematologic, gynecologic, gastro-intestinal, bone and soft tissue cancers, whereas in the IVM group patients had estrogen-receptor positive breast cancer, hematologic and brain cancers. The control (unexposed) group consisted of 70 age-matched women with male factor infertility undergoing the same treatment protocol (IVF n 42 and IVM n 28). All women were aged 42 years and undergoing their first cycle of ART. There were no differences in age and FSH levels between the cancer and the control groups. However, the antral follicle count (AFC) was lower in the cancer-IVF group (median: 5, range: 312) than in the control group (median: 15, range: 1218; P 0.0009). Women with cancer treated with IVF had lower peak estradiol levels on the day of hCG administration than controls (P 0.006) and lower number of oocytes retrieved [median: 4.5, range: 27; versus 12 (816) in controls; P 0.0001]. In patients with cancer treated with IVM, the AFC was lower than in the control group (median: 14, range: 9.517; versus median: 20.5 range: 1623, respectively; P 0.0007). Likewise, the number of oocytes retrieved was lower in the cancer-IVM group (median: 6, range: 410) than that in the control group (median 10.5, range: 7.517; P 0.01). The percentage of mature metaphase II oocytes was comparable in the cancer and control groups. The ovarian reserve, response to gonadotrophins and number of oocytes retrieved are adversely affected by previous chemotherapy. This study reports the first series of IVM outcomes in cancer patients with a prior history of chemotherapy. In women with estrogen-receptor positive breast cancer, IVM of oocytes with cryopreservation of oocytes or embryos is a viable option. Since the efficacy of ART is significantly reduced after chemotherapy, early referral for fertility preservation before gonadotoxic treatment will give these young women the best chance to conceive.

However, little information is known about molecular mechanisms underlying myogenic conversion of BMSCs. microRNAs as endogenous noncoding small molecules function to inhibit protein translation post-transcriptionally by binding to complementary sequences of targeted mRNAs. Here, we reported that miR-124 was remarkably downregulated during cardiomyocyte differentiation of BMSCs induced by coculture with cardiomyocytes. Forced expression of miR-124 led to a significant downregulation of cardiac-specific markers-ANP, TNT, and alpha-MHC proteins as well as reduction of cardiac potassium channel currents in cocultured BMSCs. On the contrary, the inhibition of endogenous miR-124 with its antisense oligonucleotide AMO-124 obviously reversed the changes of ANP, TNT, and alpha-MHC proteins and increased cardiac potassium channel currents. Further study revealed that miR-124 targeted the 3'UTR of STAT3 gene so as to suppress the expression of STAT3 protein but did not affect its mRNA level. STAT3 inhibitors AG490, WP1066, and S3I-201 were shown to attenuate the augmented expression of ANP, TNT, alpha-MHC, GATA-4 proteins, and mRNAs in cocultured BMSCs with AMO-124 transfection. Moreover, GATA-4 siRNA reduced the expression of ANP, TNT, alpha-MHC, and GATA-4 proteins but did not impact STAT3 protein in cocultured BMSCs, indicating GATA-4 serves as an effector of STAT3. In summary, we found that miR-124 regulated myogenic differentiation of BMSCs via targeting STAT3 mRNA, which provides new insights into molecular mechanisms of cardiomyogenesis of BMSCs.

This is made possible thanks to a novel learning rule based on spike-timing-dependent plasticity and embedded in an artificial spiking neural network serving as a brain-like controller. The subsequent bio-inspired cognitive system carries out different classical conditioning tasks in a controlled virtual 3D-world while the timing and frequency of unconditioned and conditioned parameters are varied. The results of this simulated robotic environment are analysed at different stages from stimuli capture to neural spike generation and show extended behavioural capabilities by the robot in the temporal domain.

We report a case of a medically complex and frail 88-yr-old woman with endometrial cancer who was scheduled for a robotic-assisted total abdominal hysterectomy. In addition to her cardiac morbidity she presented with several risk factors for neurocognitive decline, including prior episodes of postoperative delirium. The patient underwent functional, nutritional, and neuropsychological assessments prior to a three-week prehabilitation home-based program consisting of strength and endurance exercises as well as nutritional optimization. Remarkably, there were no episodes of postoperative confusion, and over the following eight weeks, she continued to show sustained improvement in exercise tolerance (as per the six-minute walk test), cognitive function (as per the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status), and overall functional capacity (Short Form-36). This report provides suggestive evidence that a prehabilitation program optimized the health of this elderly patient and may have prevented a further episode of postoperative delirium. Prehabilitation protocols should be evaluated in clinical trials to evaluate their efficacy and the target populations who may benefit and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms responsible for enhanced recovery in the perioperative setting.

Amongst the major complications of diabetes mellitus are retinopathy, neuropathy, nephropathy and accelerated atherosclerosis. Increased bioavailability of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (termed oxidative stress), derived in large part from the NADPH oxidase (Nox) family of free radical producing enzymes, has been demonstrated in experimental and clinical diabetes and has been implicated in the cardiovascular and renal complications of diabetes. The present review focuses on the role of Noxs and oxidative stress in some major complications of diabetes, including nephropathy, retinopathy and atherosclerosis. We also discuss Nox isoforms as potential targets for therapy.

Hypomyelination has been reported in patients with chromosome 18q- and postulated to be secondary to deletion of the gene coding for myelin basic protein found at 18q23. Little however is reported on cerebral anomalies seen in patients with ring chromosome 18, an analogous syndrome but with expectedly more severe phenotype secondary to the combined deletions of genetic material from both the short (p-) and long arm (q-) of chromosome 18. We are reporting a case of a girl with ring chromosome 18 and deletions involving 18p11.32-18p11.21 and 18q21.31-18q23. The abnormalities observed on magnetic resonance imaging are discussed with a specific focus on the evolution and significance of associated white matter changes.

Materials and Methods: We present a method to detect and quantify inter-packet motion, apply it to 2384 MRIs to determine the prevalence of inter-packet motion in clinical trial data, and show the effect of inter-packet motion on measuring multiple sclerosis (MS) lesion volumes. Results: Experiments with simulated data showed that the detection procedure was accurate at measuring the amount of movement between packets and quantifying the amount of missing data. Application to clinical trial data demonstrated that a large number of MRIs had missing data due to inter-packet motion; 20% of the images had greater than 10% of the data missing and 10% of the images had greater than 15% of the data missing. These levels corresponded to thresholds where lesions were difficult to visually identify or disappeared completely. Lesion volume measurement errors ranged from 1.3 +/- 0.5% to 9.9 +/- 6.3%. Conclusion: Inter-packet motion can introduce substantial errors to MRI-derived brain pathology measurements. The prevalence of inter-packet motion is substantial in MS clinical trial data. Automated detection procedures should be implemented to increase the fidelity of MRI-derived measurements. J. Magn. Reson. Imaging 2012;36:332343. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Factors associated with emotional and behavioral outcomes in adolescents with multiple sclerosis	MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS JOURNAL			English	Article						multiple sclerosis; childhood; psychosocial functioning; behavior; adjustment	PSYCHOLOGICAL ADJUSTMENT; CHILDREN; DEPRESSION; ABNORMALITIES; IMPAIRMENT; PREDICTORS; DISABILITY; DISORDERS; CHILDHOOD	Background: Multiple sclerosis (MS) onset during adolescence has the potential to disrupt a key period of psychosocial maturation. Objective: We aimed to examine the prevalence and risk factors associated with emotional and behavioral outcomes in adolescents with MS. Methods: The Behavioral Assessment System for Children-2nd Edition (BASC-2) was completed by 31 adolescents with MS (mean age = 16.1 years), 31 age-matched controls, and parents of all participants. BASC-2 outcomes were compared between groups. Base rates were examined for scores falling at least one or two standard deviations below norm. Associations between BASC-2 outcomes and features of disease severity and IQ were examined. Results: Youth with MS were reported by their parents to have more symptoms of depression and somatization and lower adaptive skills compared with reports by parents of controls. On the self-report, patients endorsed more problems of inattention/hyperactivity and lower self-reliance relative to controls. Behavioral concerns and reduced adaptive functioning in the MS group were associated with fatigue, poor relations with parents, and perceived social stress. Psychosocial outcomes did not associate with number of relapses, Expanded Disability Status Scale score, disease duration, brain lesion volume or IQ. Conclusion: Youth with MS are at risk of difficulties in behavioral and emotional health. Relations with parents emerged as a key factor influencing the emotional well-being of youth with MS, suggesting an important role for family-centered care in this population.

Eight-year-old participants (N = 38) were scanned using magnetic resonance imaging. ODD symptoms were assessed using the Dominic-R interactive. In ODD participants, we observed a significant reduction of gray matter density in the left orbitofrontal cortexa prefrontal region that plays a pivotal role in emotional self-regulation and impulse controland, conversely, an increase in the left temporal areaan area that has been associated with aggressive, impulsive, and antisocial personality. Furthermore, ODD boys showed a reduction of both gray matter density in the left orbitofrontal cortex and of white matter density in the left superior frontal area. The structural abnormalities found in the present study, in particular, the correlation between ODD symptoms and reduction of gray matter density in the left orbitofrontal cortex, may present some evidence for the existence of neuropathology associated with ODD symptoms during childhood. Furthermore, our findings indicate morphometric differences between boys and girls with ODD, which may be associated with gender differences in social behavior in children showing ODD symptoms.

J	Dal Maso, F; Longcamp, M; Amarantini, D				Dal Maso, Fabien; Longcamp, Marieke; Amarantini, David			Training-related decrease in antagonist muscles activation is associated with increased motor cortex activation: evidence of central mechanisms for control of antagonist muscles	EXPERIMENTAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Motor cortex oscillations; Strength training; Central adaptations; Agonist and antagonist muscles activation; Isometric contractions	TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; EVENT-RELATED DESYNCHRONIZATION; INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; CORTICOMUSCULAR COHERENCE; FUNCTIONAL MRI; SENSORIMOTOR CORTEX; CORTICAL ACTIVITY; HUMAN BRAIN; ADAPTATIONS; FORCE	During human contraction, net joint torque production involves the contribution of the antagonist muscles. Their activation protects the articulations and facilitates movement accuracy, but despite these fundamental roles, little is known about the brain mechanisms underlying their control. In view of previous studies that showed lesser antagonist muscles activation in participants engaged in regular strength training (ST) than in participants actively engaged in endurance disciplines (ED), we used this between-group comparison to investigate the possible role of motor cortex activity on the control of antagonist muscles. Electroencephalographic (EEG) and electromyographic (EMG) activity as well as the net joint torque were recorded, while ten ST and eleven ED participants performed isometric knee muscles exertions at different force levels. EEG data showed a linear increase in the suppression of cortical oscillations in the 21-31 Hz frequency band with increasing force level in ST but not in ED participants. This effect was associated with lesser EMG activation of the antagonist muscles in ST than in ED participants, the difference between groups also increasing with the force level. Both effects were found specifically during flexion exertions, indicating that ST participants developed sharp central adaptations to control the antagonist muscles involved as prime movers in their usual training task. This result suggests that the cortical adaptations induced by regular strength training could exert a specific encoding of the antagonist muscles, leading to the minimization of their activation and improved energetic efficiency of the muscle contraction.

A non-human primate system for large-scale genetic studies of complex traits	HUMAN MOLECULAR GENETICS			English	Article							TIME RT-PCR; VERVET MONKEYS; IDENTIFICATION; EXPRESSION; GENOME; MODEL; QUANTIFICATION; HERITABILITY; POPULATION; PHENOTYPES	Non-human primates provide genetic model systems biologically intermediate between humans and other mammalian model organisms. Populations of Caribbean vervet monkeys (Chlorocebus aethiops sabaeus) are genetically homogeneous and large enough to permit well-powered genetic mapping studies of quantitative traits relevant to human health, including expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL). Previous transcriptome-wide investigation in an extended vervet pedigree identified 29 heritable transcripts for which levels of expression in peripheral blood correlate strongly with expression levels in the brain. Quantitative trait linkage analysis using 261 microsatellite markers identified significant (n 8) and suggestive (n 4) linkages for 12 of these transcripts, including both cis- and trans-eQTL. Seven transcripts, located on different chromosomes, showed maximum linkage to markers in a single region of vervet chromosome 9; this observation suggests the possibility of a master trans-regulator locus in this region. For one cis-eQTL (at B3GALTL, beta-1,3-glucosyltransferase), we conducted follow-up single nucleotide polymorphism genotyping and fine-scale association analysis in a sample of unrelated Caribbean vervets, localizing this eQTL to a region of 200 kb. These results suggest the value of pedigree and population samples of the Caribbean vervet for linkage and association mapping studies of quantitative traits. The imminent whole genome sequencing of many of these vervet samples will enhance the power of such investigations by providing a comprehensive catalog of genetic variation.

Nerve growth factor content is increased in the rectal mucosa of children with diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome	NEUROGASTROENTEROLOGY AND MOTILITY			English	Article						abdominal pain; children; irritable bowel syndrome; mast cells; nerve growth factor; neurotrophins; visceral sensitivity	FUNCTIONAL GASTROINTESTINAL DISORDERS; MAST-CELLS; VISCERAL HYPERSENSITIVITY; ABDOMINAL-PAIN; NEUROTROPHIC FACTOR; INFLAMMATION; STRESS; RATS; DISTENSION; HYPERALGESIA	Background The enteric nervous system is a complex network that includes, in the digestive mucosa, neuronal bodies and fibers interacting with the immune system and mucosal mast cells (MC). These interactions involve the secretion of messengers, such as the neurotrophin nerve growth factor (NGF), which influence colonic motility and sensitivity, both affected in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). This study was designed to test the hypothesis that, in children with IBS, colonic mucosal innervation, NGF content, and MC infiltration are altered. We aimed to measure MC infiltration, number of neuronal bodies, distance from MC to nerve fibers, inflammation, and NGF content in rectal mucosa of pediatric patients with IBS as compared with controls. Methods Rectal biopsies from children (median age: 14 years) with diarrhea-predominant IBS (n = 11) and controls (n = 14) were studied. MC and neuronal mucosal structures were identified by tryptase, CD117 and PGP9.5 immunoreactivity. Inflammatory cells (neutrophils, eosinophils, and lymphocytes) were counted. NGF was quantified in situ by ELISA. Key Results No mucosal inflammation was detected in IBS. MC infiltration and number of neuronal bodies were not significantly different between IBS and controls. The distance between MC and nerve fibers was not different in IBS compared with controls (5.2 +/- 0.3 vs 5.0 +/- 0.3 mu m). Number of MC in close proximity to nerve fibers (<5 mu m) was not different in the two groups. However, in IBS, NGF content was higher than controls (0.93 +/- 0.3 vs 0.62 +/- 0.3 pg mg-1 protein, P < 0.05) and significantly correlated with MC number. Conclusions & Inferences Regardless of inflammation, NGF content is increased in rectal mucosa of diarrhea-predominant IBS children.

We previously found that ADHD is characterized by a delayed maturation of prefrontal cortical thickness. We now ask if this extends to the maturation of cortical surface area and gyrification. Methods: Two hundred thirty-four children with ADHD and 231 typically developing children participated in the study, with 837 neuroanatomic magnetic resonance images acquired longitudinally. We defined the developmental trajectories of cortical surfaces and gyrification and the sequence of cortical maturation, as indexed by the age at which each cortical vertex attained its peak surface area. Results: In both groups, the maturation of cortical surface area progressed in centripetal waves, both lateral (starting at the central sulcus and frontopolar regions, sweeping toward the mid and superior frontal gyrus) and medial (descending down the medial prefrontal cortex, toward the cingulate gyrus). However, the surface area developmental trajectory was delayed in ADHD. For the right prefrontal cortex, the median age by which 50% of cortical vertices attained peak area was 14.6 years (SE = .03) in ADHD, significantly later than in typically developing group at 12.7 years (SE = .03) [log-rank test chi(1)(2) = 1300, p < .00001]. Similar, but less pronounced, delay was found in the left hemispheric lobes. There were no such diagnostic differences in the developmental trajectories of cortical gyrification. Conclusions: The congruent delay in cortical thickness and surface area direct attention away from processes that selectively affect one cortical component toward mechanisms controlling the maturation of multiple cortical dimensions.

Stacks of adsorbed polymers can be engineered as soft wet three dimensional matrices, with properties tailored to support cell survival and growth. Here, we have developed a combinatorial method to generate coatings that self assemble from solutions of polyelectrolytes in water, layer by layer, to produce a polyelectrolyte multilayer (PEM) coating that has enabled high-throughput screening for cellular biocompatibility. Two dimensional combinatorial PEMs were used to rapidly identify assembly conditions that promote optimal cell survival and viability. Conditions were first piloted using a cell line, human embryonic kidney 293 cells (HER 293), and subsequently tested using primary cultures of embryonic rat spinal commissural neurons. Cell viability was correlated with surface energy (wettability), modulus (matrix stiffness), and surface charge of the coatings.Our findings indicate that the modulus is a crucial determinant of the capacity of a surface to inhibit or support cell survival.

J	Lefebvre, H; Levert, MJ				Lefebvre, Helene; Levert, Marie-Josee			The close relatives of people who have had a traumatic brain injury and their special needs	BRAIN INJURY			English	Article						Caregivers needs; services; continuum of care; brain injury; developing reflexive analysis for partnership; qualitative research	CARERS; INDIVIDUALS; EXPERIENCES; FAMILIES	Primary objective: This study aims to paint a picture of the needs of people close to individuals with a TBI and the services offered to answer these needs, from the point of view of the individuals with a TBI and health professionals. Research design: This study has a qualitative design and a reflexive group was used to collect data. The demarche reflexive d'analyse en partenariat, DRAP (developing reflexive analysis for partnership) was used as a data collection method. The sample comprised Montreal family members (n = 4), Outaouais family members (n = 8), Abitibi family members (n = 7); Montreal care providers (n = 9), Outaouais care providers (n = 11) and Abitibi care providers (n = 9). Main outcomes and results: The results show that people close to individuals with a TBI need information on the health problem, specifically with regard to the diagnostic, the prognostic, and the factors that influence it, as well as the steps towards rehabilitation, and care and services. The results show that close ones need specific, quality services and continuity of services. Conclusion: In conclusion, the pertinence of this study lies in the desire of close ones and health professionals to ease the adaptation process imposed by a TBI, and to promote the well-being of informal caregivers.

Methods and procedures: Forty-six patients with sTBI took part in a long-term outcome study where the FCT and the Neurobehavioural Rating Scale-Revised (NBRS-R) were administered and the FIM (TM) instrument was rated. The FCT is a telephone information gathering task for evaluating functional cognitive skills. Results: Ten of 16 measures of the FCT were significantly correlated with similar or related concepts from the NBRS-R. The FIM (TM) cognitive score and the individual items of this score were significantly correlated with 13 of the FCT measures and with the percentage of amount of information gathered. Internal consistency was good for 13 of 16 measures. Overall, patients generally had mild difficulty on the FCT concepts. Conclusion: The FCT can be used with patients with sTBI to evaluate certain aspects of functional cognition. It has good criterion validity and internal consistency, but additional research is required to further measure reliability and its applicability to other severity of TBI and to other phases of recovery.

DEVELOPMENTAL MEDICINE AND CHILD NEUROLOGY			English	Article							GROSS MOTOR FUNCTION; FUNCTION CLASSIFICATION-SYSTEM; BIRTH-DEFECTS; CHILDREN; DEFINITION; PREVALENCE; ANOMALIES; SUBTYPE	Aim The aim of this article was to identify and contrast the subset of children with cerebral palsy (CP) and non-central nervous system (CNS) congenital malformations with children with CP but no coexisting non-CNS congenital malformations. Method A population-based regional comprehensive CP registry was used to identify children with CP who had non-CNS congenital malformations (n=34; 19 males, 15 females; 22 classified as Gross Motor Function Classification System [GMFCS] levels IIII, 12 as GMFCS level IV or V). Their clinical features were then compared with other children with CP without non-CNS congenital malformations (n=207; 115 males, 92 females; 138 classified as GMFCS levels IIII, 69 as GMFCS level IV or V). Results Children with CP and non-CNS congenital malformations did not differ from those without in terms of neurological subtype distribution or functional severity, as measured by the GMFCS. Also, there was no association with previous maternal infections (i.e. toxoplasmosis, rubella, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus 2 [TORCH]), maternal fever, use of illicit substances, asphyxia, neonatal encephalopathy, intraventricular haemorrhage, or septicaemia. The incidence of comorbidities such as convulsions, communication difficulties, gavage feeding, cortical blindness, and auditory impairment was not higher in this subgroup. Interpretation The incidence of congenital non-CNS malformations among children with CP is appreciable. Children with these non-CNS malformations do not appear to differ from other children with CP regarding neurological subtype, functional severity, and comorbidities, or maternal or obstetrical factors. Thus, the specific presence of a non-CNS congenital malformation does not appear to assist the practitioner in the management or understanding of a childs CP.

The first section presents this "neuroscience argument for responsive early childcare". The second section introduces some evidential challenges posed by the use of evidence from developmental neuroscience as grounds for parental practice recommendations and then advances a set of observations about the limitations of the evidence typically cited. Section three highlights the ethical implications of the neuroscience argument for responsive early childcare. It argues that the neuroscience argument, first, fuels unwarranted parental anxiety by unduly raising the stakes of families' early childcare choices and, second, threatens public confidence in developmental science's potential to inform childcare practices and policy that enhance children's health and well being.

We report here that this method can detect subtle cholinergic terminals losses such as those associated with aging, or those following a partial lesion of the nucleus basalis magnocellularis (NBM). Twenty-one adult rats were evenly distributed in three groups including 1) aged rats (18 months); 2) young rats (3 months); and 3) rats with unilateral lesion of the NBM, following a local stereotaxic infusion of 192 IgG-saporin. In both normal and lesioned rats, our results revealed the highest [F-18]FEOBV binding to be in the striatum, followed by similar values in both frontal cortex and thalamus, while lower values were observed in both hippocampus and temporo-parietal cortex. This binding distribution is consistent with the known anatomy of brain cholinergic systems. In the lesioned rats, [F-18]FEOBV binding was found to be reduced mostly in the ventral frontal cortex on the side of the lesion, but some reductions were also observed in the homologous region of the contralateral hemisphere. Aging was found to be associated with a [F-18]FEOBV binding reduction limited to the hippocampus of both hemispheres. [F-18]FEOBV appears to be a very promising marker for the in vivo quantification of the brain VAChT; PET imaging of this agent allows in vivo detection of both physiological and pathological reductions of cholinergic terminals density.

Despite aggressive therapy, more than half of the children with advanced NB will die of uncontrolled metastatic disease. After chemotherapy, tumor-initiating cells (TICs) could persist, cause relapses and metastasis. The aim of this study is to demonstrate the tumor-initiating properties of CD133high NB cells and to identify new specific genetic abnormalities. Isolation of the CD133high cell population from NB cell lines was followed by neurosphere formation, soft agar assays, and orthotopic injections in NOD/SCID/IL2R?c-null mice. A differential genotyping analysis was performed with Affymetrix SNP 6.0 arrays on CD133low and CD133high populations and the frequency of the abnormalities of 36 NB tumors was determined. Our results show that CD133high NB cells possess tumor-initiating properties, as CD133high cells formed significantly more neurospheres and produced significantly more colonies in soft agar than CD133low. Injection of 500 CD133high cells was sufficient to generate primary tumors and frequent metastases in mice. Differential genotyping analysis demonstrated two common regions with gains (16p13.3 and 19p13.3) including the gene EFNA2 in the CD133high population, and two with loss of heterozygosity (16q12.1 and 21q21.3) in the CD133low population. The gain of EFNA2 correlated with increased expression of the corresponding protein. These abnormalities were found in NB samples and some were significantly correlated with CD133 expression. Our results show that CD133high NB cells have TICs properties and present different genotyping characteristics compared to CD133low cells. Our findings reveal insights into new therapeutic targets in NB TICs. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

It is assumed that the price processes of the underlying stocks are given by Markov processes. We use the Monte Carlo approach to generate artificial sample paths of these price processes, and then we use nonparametric regression estimates to estimate from this data so-called continuation values, which are defined as mean values of the American option for given values of the underlying stocks at time t subject to the constraint that the option is not exercised at time t. As nonparametric regression estimates we use least squares estimates with complexity penalties, which include as special cases least squares spline estimates, least squares neural networks, smoothing splines and orthogonal series estimates. General results concerning rate of convergence are presented and applied to derive results for the special cases mentioned above. Furthermore the pricing of American options is illustrated by simulated data. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Recent work suggests that gray matter volumes of the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) are correlated with aggregate symptom attribution scores in first-episode schizophrenia. Whether regions beyond the OFC are important for symptom attribution remains to be established. Further, whether common or separable neural systems underlie attribution of specific symptoms (e.g., delusions, asociality) has not been studied. In the current magnetic resonance imaging study, 52 people with a first-episode psychosis (FEP) were rated with the Scale for Assessment of Unawareness of Mental Disorder on attribution of hallucinations, delusions, flat affect and asociality. Attribution ratings were regressed on cortical thickness at 81,924 vertices. Mapping statistics revealed that delusion misattribution was associated with thickness in the OFC [Brodmann's area (BA) 11/47]. Delusion, flat affect and asociality misattribution were associated with cortical thinness in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (BA 9/46). Differential associations emerged between each attribution item and cortical thickness/thinness in a variety of frontal, temporal, parietal and occipital areas. The results imply a selective role for the OFC in delusion misattribution in FEP. Evidence for cortical thickness covariation in a variety of regions suggests partial independence in the neural architecture underlying attribution for different symptoms in FEP.

Interspecies Avian Brain Chimeras Reveal That Large Brain Size Differences Are Influenced by Cell-Interdependent Processes	PLOS ONE			English	Article							QUAIL-CHICK CHIMERAS; SPECIES-DIFFERENCES; MELOPSITTACUS-UNDULATUS; SUBVENTRICULAR ZONES; BOBWHITE QUAIL; BIGGER BRAINS; EVOLUTION; BIRDS; TELENCEPHALON; NEUROGENESIS	Like humans, birds that exhibit vocal learning have relatively delayed telencephalon maturation, resulting in a disproportionately smaller brain prenatally but enlarged telencephalon in adulthood relative to vocal non-learning birds. To determine if this size difference results from evolutionary changes in cell-autonomous or cell-interdependent developmental processes, we transplanted telencephala from zebra finch donors (a vocal-learning species) into Japanese quail hosts (a vocal non-learning species) during the early neural tube stage (day 2 of incubation), and harvested the chimeras at later embryonic stages (between 9-12 days of incubation). The donor and host tissues fused well with each other, with known major fiber pathways connecting the zebra finch and quail parts of the brain. However, the overall sizes of chimeric finch telencephala were larger than non-transplanted finch telencephala at the same developmental stages, even though the proportional sizes of telencephalic subregions and fiber tracts were similar to normal finches. There were no significant changes in the size of chimeric quail host midbrains, even though they were innervated by the physically smaller zebra finch brain, including the smaller retinae of the finch eyes. Chimeric zebra finch telencephala had a decreased cell density relative to normal finches. However, cell nucleus size differences between each species were maintained as in normal birds. These results suggest that telencephalic size development is partially cell-interdependent, and that the mechanisms controlling the size of different brain regions may be functionally independent.

We have generated Caenorhabditis elegans and zebrafish animal models expressing mutant human TDP-43 (A315T or G348C) or FUS (S57 Delta or R521H) that reflect certain aspects of ALS including motor neuron degeneration, axonal deficits, and progressive paralysis. To explore the potential of our humanized transgenic C. elegans and zebrafish in identifying chemical suppressors of mutant TDP-43 and FUS neuronal toxicity, we tested three compounds with potential neuroprotective properties: lithium chloride, methylene blue and riluzole. We identified methylene blue as a potent suppressor of TDP-43 and FUS toxicity in both our models. Our results indicate that methylene blue can rescue toxic phenotypes associated with mutant TDP-43 and FUS including neuronal dysfunction and oxidative stress.

Epidermal Growth Factor-induced Vacuolar (H+)-ATPase Assembly A ROLE IN SIGNALING VIA mTORC1 ACTIVATION	JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							AMINO-ACID TRANSPORTER; INDUCED DNA-SYNTHESIS; YEAST V-ATPASE; H+-ATPASE; PROTEIN-KINASE; FACTOR RECEPTOR; RAT-LIVER; PHOSPHATIDYLINOSITOL 3-KINASE; PLASMA-MEMBRANE; CELL-GROWTH	Using proteomics and immunofluorescence, we demonstrated epidermal growth factor (EGF) induced recruitment of extrinsic V-1 subunits of the vacuolar (H+)-ATPase (V-ATPase) to rat liver endosomes. This was accompanied by reduced vacuolar pH. Bafilomycin, an inhibitor of V-ATPase, inhibited EGF-stimulated DNA synthesis and mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) activation as indicated by a decrease in eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding 1 (4E-BP1) phosphorylation and p70 ribosomal S6 protein kinase (p70S6K) phosphorylation and kinase activity. There was no corresponding inhibition of EGF-induced Akt and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk) activation. Chloroquine, a neutralizer of vacuolar pH, mimicked bafilomycin effects. Bafilomycin did not inhibit the association of mTORC1 with Raptor nor did it affect AMP-activated protein kinase activity. Rather, the intracellular concentrations of essential but not non-essential amino acids were decreased by bafilomycin in EGF-treated primary rat hepatocytes. Cycloheximide, a translation elongation inhibitor known to augment intracellular amino acid levels, prevented the effect of bafilomycin on amino acids levels and completely reversed its inhibition of EGF-induced mTORC1 activation. In vivo administration of EGF stimulated the recruitment of Ras homologue enriched in brain (Rheb) but not mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) to endosomes and lysosomes. This was inhibited by chloroquine treatment. Our results suggest a role for vacuolar acidification in EGF signaling to mTORC1.

It operationalizes six emotional endophenotypes with empirical evidence derived from ethology, neural analyses and pharmacology: PLAYFULNESS/joy, SEEKING/interest, CARING/nurturance, ANGER/rage, FEAR/anxiety, and SADNESS/separation distress. We aimed to provide a short version of this questionnaire (ANPS-S). Methodology/Principal Findings: We used a sample of 830 young French adults which was randomly split into two subsamples. The first subsample was used to select the items for the short scales. The second subsample and an additional sample of 431 Canadian adults served to evaluate the psychometric properties of the short instrument. The ANPS-S was similar to the long version regarding intercorrelations between the scales and gender differences. The ANPS-S had satisfactory psychometric properties, including factorial structure, unidimensionality of all scales, and internal consistency. The scores from the short version were highly correlated with the scores from the long version. Conclusions/Significance: The short ANPS proves to be a promising instrument to assess endophenotypes for psychiatrically relevant science.

A L2HGDH initiator methionine codon mutation in a Yorkshire terrier with L-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria	BMC VETERINARY RESEARCH			English	Article						L-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria; L2HGDH; Yorkshire terrier; Initiator methionine codon	METABOLITE REPAIR; GENE; DEHYDROGENASE; DISEASE; DEFECT; DOGS	Background: L-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria is a metabolic repair deficiency characterized by elevated levels of L-2-hydroxyglutaric acid in urine, blood and cerebrospinal fluid. Neurological signs associated with the disease in humans and dogs include seizures, ataxia and dementia. Case presentation: Here we describe an 8 month old Yorkshire terrier that presented with episodes of hyperactivity and aggressive behavior. Between episodes, the dog's behavior and neurologic examinations were normal. A T2 weighted MRI of the brain showed diffuse grey matter hyperintensity and a urine metabolite screen showed elevated 2-hydroxyglutaric acid. We sequenced all 10 exons and intron-exon borders of L2HGDH from the affected dog and identified a homozygous A to G transition in the initiator methionine codon. The first inframe methionine is at p.M183 which is past the mitochondrial targeting domain of the protein. Initiation of translation at p.M183 would encode an N-terminal truncated protein unlikely to be functional. Conclusions: We have identified a mutation in the initiation codon of L2HGDH that is likely to result in a nonfunctional gene. The Yorkshire terrier could serve as an animal model to understand the pathogenesis of L-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria and to evaluate potential therapies.	[Farias, Fabiana H.

With this modified version of the program, virtual screening and further docking-based optimization of a selected hit led to the identification of potential covalent reversible inhibitors of prolyl oligopeptidase activity. After visual inspection, a virtual hit molecule together with four analogues were selected for synthesis and made in one five chemical steps. Biological evaluations on recombinant POP and FAP alpha enzymes, cell extracts, and living cells demonstrated high potency and selectivity for POP over FAP alpha and DPPIV. Three compounds even exhibited high nanomolar inhibitory activities in intact living human cells and acceptable metabolic stability. This small set of molecules also demonstrated that covalent binding and/or geometrical constraints to the ligand/protein complex may lead to an increase in bioactivity.

CDF Collaboration	Measurement of the top quark mass in the all-hadronic mode at CDF	PHYSICS LETTERS B			English	Article						CDF; Tevatron; Top quark mass; All-hadronic channel; Jet energy scale; Likelihood fit; Physics		A measurement of the top quark mass (M-top) in the all-hadronic decay channel is presented. It uses 5.8 fb(-1) of pp data collected with the CDF II detector at the Fermilab Tevatron Collider. Events with six to eight jets are selected by a neural network algorithm and by the requirement that at least one of the jets is tagged as a b-quark jet. The measurement is performed with a likelihood fit technique, which simultaneously determines Mtop and the jet energy scale (JES) calibration. The fit yields a value of M-top = 172.5 +/- 1.4(stat) +/- 1.0(JES) +/- 1.1(syst) GeV/c(2). (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We used histology, immunohistochemistry, histomorphometry, Western blots and electrophysiological recordings to compare the proliferation and differentiation of neural stem cells, neuronal hippocampal synaptic transmission, and brain phenotypes including shape and structures, in Pthrp knock-in mice, which express PTHrP (1-84), a truncated form of the protein that is missing the NLS and the C-terminal region of the protein, and their wild-type littermates. Results showed that Pthrp knock-in mice display abnormal brain shape and structures; decreased neural cell proliferative capacity and increased apoptosis associated with up-regulation of cyclin dependent kinase inhibitors p16, p21, p27 and p53 and down-regulation of the Bmi-1 oncogene; delayed neural cell differentiation; and impaired hippocampal synaptic transmission and plasticity. These findings provide in vivo experimental evidence that the NLS and C-terminus of PTHrP are essential not only for the regulation of neural cell proliferation and differentiation, but also for the maintenance of normal neuronal synaptic transmission and plasticity.

Oligodendrocyte Precursor Cell Transplantation into Organotypic Cerebellar Shiverer Slices: A Model to Study Myelination and Myelin Maintenance	PLOS ONE			English	Article							IN-VITRO; REMYELINATION; CULTURES; DIFFERENTIATION; PROTEIN	Current in vitro models to investigate the consequence of oligodendrocyte-specific loss-of-function mutations on myelination are primarily limited to co-culture experiments, which do not accurately recapitulate the complex in vivo environment. Here, we describe the development of an in vitro model of myelination and myelin maintenance in which oligodendrocyte precursor cells are transplanted into organotypic cerebellar slice cultures derived from dysmyelinated shiverer mice. Compared to neuron-oligodendrocyte co-cultures, organotypic slices more closely mimic the environment in vivo, while utilizing a genetic background that allows for straight-forward identification of myelin generated by transplanted cells. We show at the ultrastructural level that the myelin generated by wild-type transplanted oligodendrocytes is compact and terminates in cytoplasmic loops that form paranodal junctions with the axon. This myelination results in the appropriate sequestering of axonal proteins into specialized domains surrounding the nodes of Ranvier. We also demonstrate the applicability of this approach for xenograft transplantation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells derived from rat or human sources. This method provides a time-efficient and cost-effective adjunct to conditional knockout mouse lines or in vivo transplantation models to study oligodendrocyte-specific loss-of-function mutations. Furthermore, the approach can be readily used to assess the effect of pharmacological manipulations on myelin, providing a tool to better understand myelination and develop effective therapeutic strategies to treat myelin-related diseases.

Doublecortin Recognizes the 13-Protofilament Microtubule Cooperatively and Tracks Microtubule Ends	DEVELOPMENTAL CELL			English	Article							SUBCORTICAL LAMINAR HETEROTOPIA; IN-VITRO; CRYOELECTRON MICROSCOPY; NEURONAL MIGRATION; URACIL-EXCISION; RING COMPLEX; TUBULIN; NUCLEATION; DYNAMICS; LATTICE	Neurons, like all cells, face the problem that tubulin forms microtubules with too many or too few protofilaments (pfs). Cells overcome this heterogeneity with the gamma-tubulin ring complex, which provides a nucleation template for 13-pf microtubules. Doublecortin (DCX), a protein that stabilizes microtubules in developing neurons, also nucleates 13-pf microtubules in vitro. Using fluorescence microscopy assays, we show that the binding of DCX to microtubules is optimized for the lateral curvature of the 13-pf lattice. This sensitivity depends on a cooperative interaction wherein DCX molecules decrease the dissociation rate of their neighbors. Mutations in DCX found in patients with subcortical band heterotopia weaken these cooperative interactions. Using assays with dynamic microtubules, we discovered that DCX binds to polymerization intermediates at growing microtubule ends. These results support a mechanism for stabilizing 13-pf microtubules that allows DCX to template new 1 3-pf microtubules through associations with the sides of the microtubule lattice.

These new developments are important clinically for the understanding of hereditary polyuric states. We recommend sequencing of the nephrogenic diabetes insipidus genes in all affected patients. This genomic information is key to the routine care of patients with congenital polyuria and, as in other genetic diseases, reduces health costs and confers psychological benefits on patients and families.

A convergent functional architecture of the insula emerges across imaging modalities	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Insula; Clustering; Functional connectivity; Structural covariance; Coactivation; Behavioral domains	OLD-WORLD MONKEY; INTRINSIC CONNECTIVITY NETWORKS; HUMAN BRAIN; ANTERIOR INSULA; STRUCTURAL CONNECTIVITY; PARIETAL CORTEX; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; HUMAN AWARENESS; NEURAL SYSTEMS; ORGANIZATION	Empirical evidence increasingly supports the hypothesis that patterns of intrinsic functional connectivity (iFC) are sculpted by a history of evoked coactivation within distinct neuronal networks. This, together with evidence of strong correspondence among the networks defined by iFC and those delineated using a variety of other neuroimaging techniques, suggests a fundamental brain architecture detectable across multiple functional and structural imaging modalities. Here, we leverage this insight to examine the functional organization of the human insula. We parcellated the insula on the basis of three distinct neuroimaging modalities - task-evoked coactivation, intrinsic (i.e., task-independent) functional connectivity, and gray matter structural covariance. Clustering of these three different covariance-based measures revealed a convergent elemental organization of the insula that likely reflects a fundamental brain architecture governing both brain structure and function at multiple spatial scales. While not constrained to be hierarchical, our parcellation revealed a pseudo-hierarchical, multiscale organization that was consistent with previous clustering and meta-analytic studies of the insula. Finally, meta-analytic examination of the cognitive and behavioral domains associated with each of the insular clusters obtained elucidated the broad functional dissociations likely underlying the topography observed. To facilitate future investigations of insula function across healthy and pathological states, the insular parcels have been made freely available for download via http://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org, along with the analytic scripts used to perform the parcellations.

In spite of considerable efforts over last years, very few putative biomarkers have been fully validated or successfully integrated into routine clinical practice. Here, we consider some of the main challenges that have limited such effective translation from biomarker discovery to the bedside in the context of MS, the prototypic chronic human CNS inflammatory illness. We will define the types of biomarkers that would be relevant for MS, identify their ideal attributes, and then discuss individual challenges and strategies to overcome them.

We identified a phosphoinositide-binding motif formed of two clusters of positively charged amino acids located on the P2X cytosolic C-terminal domain, proximal to the second transmembrane domain. For all known P2X subtypes, the specific arrangement of basic residues in these semi-conserved clusters determines their sensitivity to membrane phospholipids. Neutralization of these positive charges disrupts the functional properties of the prototypical phosphoinositide-binding P2X4 subtype, mimicking wortmannin-induced phosphoinositide depletion, whereas adding basic residues at homologous positions to the natively insensitive P2X5 subtype establishes de novo phosphoinositide-mediated regulation. Moreover, biochemical evidence of in vitro P2X subunit-phospholipid interaction and functional intracellular phosphoinositide-binding assays demonstrate that the dual polybasic cluster is necessary and sufficient for regulation of P2X signaling by phospholipids.

By the end of the year, 57% of the 7.8 million residents had been vaccinated. Objective To assess the risk of Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) following pandemic influenza vaccine administration. Design Population-based cohort study with follow-up over the 6-month period October 2009 through March 2010. The investigation was ordered by the chief medical officer of health in accordance with the Quebec Public Health Act. Setting All acute care hospitals and neurology clinics in Quebec. Population Suspected and confirmed GBS cases reported by physicians, mostly neurologists, during active surveillance or identified in the provincial hospital summary discharge database. Medical records were reviewed and cases classified according to Brighton Collaboration definitions (categorized as level 1, 2, or 3, corresponding to criteria of decreasing certainty in diagnosis). Immunization status was verified and denominators were estimated from the provincial immunization registry (4.4 million vaccinated) and census data (total target population aged >= 6 months, 7.8 million), with a total of 3 623 046 person-years of observation. Main Outcome Measures Relative and attributable risks were calculated using a Poisson model and the self-controlled case-series method. Results Over a 6-month period, 83 confirmed GBS cases were identified, including 71 Brighton level 1 through 3 cases. Twenty-five confirmed cases had been vaccinated against 2009 influenza A(H1N1) 8 or fewer weeks before disease onset, with most (19/25) vaccinated 4 or fewer weeks before onset. In the Poisson model, the age-and sex-adjusted relative risk was 1.80 (95% CI, 1.12-2.87) for all confirmed cases during the 8-week postvaccination period and was 2.75 (95% CI, 1.63-4.62) during the 4-week postvaccination period. Using the self-controlled case-series method, relative risk estimates during the 4-week postvaccination period were 3.02 (95% CI, 1.64-5.56) for all confirmed cases (n=42) and 2.33 (95% CI, 1.19-4.57) for Brighton level 1 through 3 cases (n=36). The number of GBS cases attributable to vaccination was approximately 2 per 1 million doses. There was no indication of an excess risk in persons younger than 50 years. Conclusions In Quebec, the 2009 influenza A(H1N1) vaccine was associated with a small but significant risk of GBS. It is likely that the benefits of immunization outweigh the risks.

Studies mostly describe the differences between scoliotic and non-scoliotic girls and focus primarily on a single set of parameters derived from spinal and pelvis morphology, posture or standing imbalance. No study addressed all these three biomechanical aspects simultaneously in pre-braced AIS girls of different scoliosis severity but with similar curve type and their interaction with scoliosis progression. The first objective of this study was to test if there are differences in these parameters between pre-braced AIS girls with a right thoracic scoliosis of moderate (less than 27 degrees) and severe (more than 27 degrees) deformity. The second objective was to identify which of these parameters are related to the Cobb angle progression either individually or in combination of thereof. Forty-five scoliotic girls, randomly selected by an orthopedic surgeon from the hospital scoliosis clinic, participated in this study. Parameters related to pelvis morphology, pelvis orientation, trunk posture and quiet standing balance were measured. Generally moderate pre-brace idiopathic scoliosis patients displayed lower values than the severe group characterized by a Cobb angle greater than 27 degrees. Only pelvis morphology and trunk posture were statistically different between the groups while pelvis orientation and standing imbalance were similar in both groups. Statistically significant Pearson coefficients of correlation between individual parameters and Cobb angle ranged between 0.32 and 0.53. Collectively trunk posture, pelvis morphology and standing balance parameters are correlated with Cobb angle at 0.82. The results suggest that spinal deformity progression is not only a question of trunk morphology distortion by itself but is also related to pelvis asymmetrical bone growth and standing neuromuscular imbalance.

Cannabinoid dysregulations might have a pathogenetic role in dopamine- and basal ganglia related neuropsychiatric disorders, such as drug addiction, psychosis, Parkinson's disease and Huntington's disease. This review highlights interactions between cannabinoids, and dopamine, to modulate neurotransmitter release and synaptic plasticity in the context of drug addiction, psychosis and cognition. Modulating endocannabinoid function, as a plasticity based therapeutic strategy, in the above pathologies with particular focus on cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1 receptor) antagonists/inverse agonists, is discussed. On the basis of the existing literature and of new experimental evidence presented here, CBI receptor antagonists might be beneficial in disease states associated with hedonic dysregulation, and with cognitive dysfunction in particular in the context of psychosis. It is suggested that this effects might be mediated via a hyperglutamatergic state through metabotropic glutamate activation. Indications for endocannabinoid catabolism inhibitors in psychiatric disorders, that might be CB1 receptor independent and might involve TRPV1 receptors, are also discussed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

The effect of the main pharmacologically active principle in cannabis, (-)-trans-Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (delta-9-THC), on depressive behavior and on the serotonin (5-HT) system, which is implicated in the mechanism of action of antidepressants, has not been extensively clarified. Here, we showed that repeated (5 days), but not single (acute) intraperitoneal (ip) treatment with delta-9-THC (1 mg/kg) exerts antidepressant-like properties in the rat forced swim test (FST). This effect was CB1R-dependent because it was blocked by the CB1R antagonist rimonabant (1 mg/kg, ip). Using in vivo electrophysiology, we demonstrated that delta-9-THC modulated dorsal raphe (DR) 5-HT neuronal activity through a CB1R-dependent mechanism. Acute intravenous delta-9-THC administration (0.1-1.5 mg/kg) elicited a complex response profile, producing excitatory, inhibitory and inert responses of 5-HT neurons. Only excitatory responses were blocked by rimonabant. Finally, repeated but not single delta-9-THC administration (1 mg/kg, ip) enhanced tonic 5-HT1A receptor activity in the hippocampus, a postsynaptic event commonly elicited by standard antidepressants. These results suggest that delta-9-THC, like other CB1R agonists and endocannabinoid enhancers, may possess antidepressant properties at low doses, and could modulate 5-HT transmission in the DR and hippocampus as standard antidepressants such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.

After nuclear export, mRNAs designated for dendritic transport are generally assumed to be translationally dormant and activity of individual synapses may locally trigger their extrasomatic translation. We show that the long, GC-rich 5'-untranslated region of dendritic SAPAP3 mRNA restricts translation initiation via a mechanism that involves an upstream open reading frame (uORF). In addition, the uORF enables the use of an alternative translation start site, permitting synthesis of two SAPAP3 isoforms from a single mRNA. While both isoforms progressively accumulate at postsynaptic densities during early rat brain development, their levels relative to each other vary in different adult rat brain areas. Thus, alternative translation initiation events appear to regulate relative expression of distinct SAPAP3 isoforms in different brain regions, which may function to influence synaptic plasticity.

Activated cranial cervical cord neurons affect left ventricular infarct size and the potential for sudden cardiac death	AUTONOMIC NEUROSCIENCE-BASIC & CLINICAL			English	Article						Adrenergic blockade; Myocardial infarction; Muscarinic blockade; Neuromodulation; Sudden cardiac death; Vagotomy	C2 SPINAL-CORD; MYOCARDIAL-ISCHEMIA; ANGINA-PECTORIS; VISCERORECEPTIVE TRANSMISSION; MITRAL-REGURGITATION; RECEPTOR BLOCKADE; REFRACTORY ANGINA; STIMULATION; MODULATION; RELEASE	To evaluate whether cervical spinal neurons can influence cardiac indices and myocyte viability in the acutely ischemic heart, the hearts of anesthetized rabbits subjected to 30 min of LAD coronary arterial occlusion (CAO) were studied 3 h after reperfusion. Control animals were compared to those exposed to pre-emptive high cervical cord stimulation (SCS; the dorsal aspect of the C1-C2 spinal cord was stimulated electrically at 50 Hz; 0.2 ms; 90% of motor threshold, starting 15 min prior to and continuing throughout CAD). Four groups of animals were so tested: 1) neuroaxis intact; 2) prior cervical vagotomy; 3) prior transection of the dorsal spinal columns at C6; and 4) following pharmacological treatment [muscarinic (atropine) or adrenergic (atenolol, prazosin or yohimbine) receptor blockade]. Infarct size (IS) was measured by tetrazolium, expressed as percentage of risk zone. C1-C2 SCS reduced acute ischemia induced IS by 43%, without changing the incidence of sudden cardiac death (SCD). While SCS-induced reduction in IS was unaffected by vagotomy, it was no longer evident following transection of C6 dorsal columns or atropinization. Beta-adrenoceptor blockade eliminated ischemia induced SCD, while alpha-receptor blockade doubled its incidence. During SCS, myocardial ischemia induced SCD was eliminated following vagotomy while remaining unaffected by atropinization. These data indicate that, in contrast to thoracic spinal neurons, i) cranial cervical spinal neurons affect both adrenergic and cholinergic motor outflows to the heart such that ii) their activation modifies ventricular infarct size and lethal arrhythmogenesis.

Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids preserve retinal function in type 2 diabetic mice	NUTRITION & DIABETES			English	Article						diabetic retinopathy; omega-3 PUFAs; electroretinography	DARK-ADAPTED ELECTRORETINOGRAM; B-WAVE; ANTIOXIDANT THERAPY; MOUSE MODEL; RETINOPATHY; PREVALENCE; ACTIVATION; INSULIN; DISEASE; ABNORMALITIES	OBJECTIVE: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is associated with hyperglycemia-driven microvascular pathology and neuronal compromise in the retina. However, DR is also linked to dyslipidemia. As omega-3 (omega-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are protective in proliferative retinopathy, we investigated the capacity of omega-3PUFAs to preserve retinal function in a mouse model of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). DESIGN: Male leptin-receptor-deficient (db/db) mice were maintained for 22 weeks (4 weeks-26 weeks of life) on calorically and compositionally matched diets, except for 2% enrichment in either omega-3 or omega-6PUFAs. Visual function was assessed at 9, 14 and 26 weeks by electroretinography. Retinal capillary and neuronal integrity, as well as glucose challenge responses, were assessed on each diet. RESULTS: The omega-3PUFA diet significantly preserved retinal function in the mouse model of T2DM to levels similar to those observed in nondiabetic control mice on normal chow. Conversely, retinal function gradually deteriorated in db/db mice on a omega-6PUFA-rich diet. There was also an enhanced ability of omega-3PUFA-fed mice to respond to glucose challenge. The protection of visual function appeared to be independent of cytoprotective or anti-inflammatory effects of omega-3PUFAs. CONCLUSION: This study identifies beneficial effects of dietary omega-3PUFAs on visual function in T2DM. The data are consistent with dyslipidemia negatively impacting retinal function. As omega-3PUFA lipid dietary interventions are readily available, safe and inexpensive, increasing omega-3PUFA intake in diabetic patients may slow the progression of vision loss in T2DM.

Three applications of the (RRBF)-R-2 network on the prediction values confirmed that the proposed architecture minimizes the prediction error. The proposed (RRBF)-R-2 is excited by the recurrence of the output looped neurons on the input layer which produces a dynamic memory on both the input and output layers. Given the learning complexity of neural networks with the use of the back-propagation training method, a simple architecture is proposed consisting of two simple Recurrent Radial Basis Function networks (RRBF). Each RRBF only has the input layer with looped neurons using the sigmoid activation function. The output of the first RRBF also presents an additional input for the second RRBF. An unsupervised learning algorithm is proposed to determine the parameters of the Radial Basis Function (RBF) nodes. The K-means unsupervised learning algorithm used for the hidden layer is enhanced by the initialization of these input parameters by the output parameters of the RCE algorithm.

Objectives To document knowledge and perceptions of pain assessment and management practices among Canadian intensive care unit nurses. Methods A self-administered questionnaire was mailed to 3753 intensive care unit nurses identified through the 12 Canadian provincial/territorial nursing associations responsible for professional regulation. Results A total of 842 nurses (24%) responded, and 802 surveys could be evaluated. Nurses were significantly less likely (P<.001) to use a pain assessment tool for patients unable to communicate (267 nurses, 33%) than for patients able to self-report (712 nurses, 89%). Significantly fewer respondents (P<.001) rated behavioral pain assessment tools as moderately to extremely important (595 nurses, 74%) compared with self-report tools (703 nurses, 88%). Routine (>50% of the time) discussion of pain scores during nursing handover was reported by 492 nurses (61%), and targeting of analgesia to a pain score or other assessment parameters by physicians by 333 nurses (42%). Few nurses (n = 235; 29%) were aware of professional society guidelines for pain assessment and management. Routine use of a behavioral pain tool was associated with awareness of published guidelines (odds ratio, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.7-3.7) and clinical availability of the tool (odds ratio, 2.6; 95% CI, 1.6-4.3). Conclusions A substantial proportion of intensive care unit nurses did not use pain assessment tools for patients unable to communicate and were unaware of pain management guidelines published by professional societies.

However, the cellular events that underlie this process still remain to be fully understood. In this study, we investigated the role of neural activity in regulating the structural plasticity of presynaptic terminals in the hippocampal formation. We designed a virus to drive the Drosophila Allatostatin receptor in individual dentate granule neurons to suppress activity of complex mossy fiber terminals 'on-demand' in organotypic slices and used time-lapse confocal imaging to determine the impact on presynaptic remodeling. We found that activity played an important role in maintaining the structural plasticity of the core region of the mossy fiber terminal (MFT) that synapses onto CA3 pyramidal cell thorny excrescences but was not essential for the motility of terminal filopodial extensions that contact local inhibitory neurons. Short-term suppression of activity did not have an impact on the size of the MFT, however, longer-term suppression reduced the overall size of the MFT. Remarkably, global blockade of activity with tetrodotoxin (TTX) interfered with the ability of single cell activity deprivation to slow down terminal dynamics suggesting that differences in activity levels among neighboring synapses promote synaptic remodeling events. The results from our studies indicate that neural activity plays an important role in maintaining structural plasticity of presynaptic compartments in the central nervous system and provide new insight into the time-frame during which activity can affect the morphology of synaptic connections.

To date, 230 mutations in presenilin (PSI, PS2) and amyloid precursor protein (APP) genes have been identified in EOFAD. The mutations within these three genes (PS UPS2/APP) affect a common pathogenic pathway in APP synthesis and proteolysis, which lead to excessive production of amyloid beta. Compared with sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD), EOFAD has some distinctive features including early age at onset, positive familial history, a variety of non-cognitive neurological symptoms and signs, and a more aggressive course. There is marked phenotypic heterogeneity among different mutations of EOFAD. Studies in presymptomatic mutation carriers reveal biomarkers abnormalities. EOFAD diagnosis is based on clinical and family history, neurological symptoms and examination, biomarker features, as well as genotyping in some cases. New therapeutic agents targeting amyloid formation may benefit EOFAD individuals.

Influence of age on the dynamics of fMRI activations during a semantic fluency task	JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY			English	Article						Functional magnetic resonance imaging; Aging; Language; Silent word generation; Dynamic course	VERBAL FLUENCY; DEFAULT-MODE; LANGUAGE LATERALIZATION; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; BRAIN ACTIVITY; OLDER ADULTS; AGING MIND; MEMORY; EVOCATION; COGNITION	Purpose: Age-related fMRI changes have not been extensively studied for language, whereas important adaptive mechanisms have been seen in other cognitive fields. This study examined age-related changes in fMRI activation during language tasks and, in particular, their dynamic course. Patients and methods: fMRI was performed on 22 young and 21 old healthy right-handed subjects during a silent category word-generation task. Activation and dynamics of BOLD signals were studied separately during the first and second portions of each 30-s block. Results: Activation of the left frontal lobe was initially similar in young and old participants; however, it decreased after 30s in the old participants. On the other hand, additional areas were initially involved only in old subjects and especially in the default mode network. Conclusion: This study showed age-related differences in the dynamics of fMRI activation during a silent word-generation task, suggesting a different pattern of language function with aging.

One hypothesized contributor to this variability is the common A118G polymorphism of the mu-opioid receptor gene, OPRM1. This article critically evaluates the evidence that the A118G substitution affects subjective, behavioral and neurobiological responses to alcohol and the opioid receptor antagonist, naltrexone. Although screening of patients in a clinical setting remains premature, results suggest the A118G substitution may influence one etiological pathway to alcoholism, for which naltrexone pharmacotherapy is more effective.

Adaptive Temperature Compensation in Circadian Oscillations	PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY			English	Article							NEUROSPORA-CRASSA; SIGNAL-TRANSDUCTION; IN-SILICO; CLOCK; LIGHT; DROSOPHILA; PROTEIN; ENTRAINMENT; DESIGN; ROBUST	A temperature independent period and temperature entrainment are two defining features of circadian oscillators. A default model of distributed temperature compensation satisfies these basic facts yet is not easily reconciled with other properties of circadian clocks, such as many mutants with altered but temperature compensated periods. The default model also suggests that the shape of the circadian limit cycle and the associated phase response curves (PRC) will vary since the average concentrations of clock proteins change with temperature. We propose an alternative class of models where the twin properties of a fixed period and entrainment are structural and arise from an underlying adaptive system that buffers temperature changes. These models are distinguished by a PRC whose shape is temperature independent and orbits whose extrema are temperature independent. They are readily evolved by local, hill climbing, optimization of gene networks for a common quality measure of biological clocks, phase anticipation. Interestingly a standard realization of the Goodwin model for temperature compensation displays properties of adaptive rather than distributed temperature compensation.

Experiment 1 used a. balanced memory array, with one color stimulus in each hemifield, followed by a retention interval and a central probe, at the fixation point that designated the target stimulus in memory about which to make a determination of orientation. Retrieval of information from VSTM was associated with an event-related lateralization (ERL) with a contralateral negativity relative to the visual field from which the probed stimulus was originally encoded, suggesting a lateralized organization of VSTM. The scalp distribution of the retrieval ERL was more anterior than what is usually associated with simple maintenance activity, which is consistent with the involvement of different brain structures for these distinct visual memory mechanisms. Experiment 2 was like Experiment 1, but used an unbalanced memory array consisting of one lateral color stimulus in a hemifield and one color stimulus on the vertical mid-line. This design enabled us to separate lateralized activity related to target retrieval from distractor processing. Target retrieval was found to generate a negative-going ERL at electrode sites found in Experiment 1, and suggested representations were retrieved from anterior cortical structures. Distractor processing elicited a positive-going ERL at posterior electrodes sites, which could be indicative of a return to baseline of retention activity for the discarded memory of the now-irrelevant stimulus, or an active inhibition mechanism mediating distractor suppression.

The evidence from therapy-induced aphasia recovery studies shows that better recovery results from the reactivation of left hemisphere function; still, the specific left hemisphere key areas that sign successful outcome with a specific therapy approach remain to be identified. Nine participants suffering from aphasia received brief and intensive therapy with Semantic Feature Analysis (SFA). Behavioural and neuroimaging data during overt picture naming were obtained prior to and after therapy. This paper reports on a group of participants having benefited from SFA, and two distinct patterns of improvement. Correlational analysis showed that differences in outcome were not related to lesion size, but were negatively correlated with damage to Broca's area (BA45). Moreover, a group analysis showed that therapy-induced recovery following SFA was characterized by (a) a significant correlation between improvement and activation in the left precentral gyrus (BA4/6) before therapy, and (b) the recruitment of the left inferior parietal lobule, an area known for its role in semantic integration, following therapy with SFA. Individual fMRI analyses showed that although adaptive brain plasticity appeared to operate differently in each patient, best responders to SFA therapy recruited less areas after training compared to participants having shown less recovery who showed a larger number of activated areas sustaining recovery. The results of the present study suggest that a significant activation of BA4/6 could indicate the use of SFA to achieve successful outcome. Also our results suggest that greater SFA improvement in chronic aphasia is associated with recruitment of areas in the left hemisphere. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Parameters of semantic multisensory integration depend on timing and modality order among people on the autism spectrum: Evidence from event-related potentials	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Autism spectrum disorders; Electrophysiology; Auditory; Visual; Perception	BRAIN POTENTIALS; ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL EVIDENCE; ENHANCED CONNECTIVITY; ASPERGER SYNDROME; AMBIGUOUS WORDS; VISUAL-CORTEX; DISCRIMINATION; CHILDREN; PERCEPTION; ATTENTION	Individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) report difficulty integrating simultaneously presented visual and auditory stimuli (larocci & McDonald, 2006), albeit showing enhanced perceptual processing of unisensory stimuli, as well as an enhanced role of perception in higher-order cognitive tasks (Enhanced Perceptual Functioning (EPF) model; Mottron, Dawson, Soulieres, Hubert, & Burack, 2006). Individuals with an ASD also integrate auditory-visual inputs over longer periods of time than matched typically developing (TD) peers (Kwakye, Foss-Feig, Cascio, Stone & Wallace, 2011). To tease apart the dichotomy of both extended multisensory processing and enhanced perceptual processing, we used behavioral and electrophysiological measurements of audio-visual integration among persons with ASD. 13 TD and 14 autistics matched on IQ completed a forced choice multisensory semantic congruence task requiring speeded responses regarding the congruence or incongruence of animal sounds and pictures. Stimuli were presented simultaneously or sequentially at various stimulus onset asynchronies in both auditory first and visual first presentations. No group differences were noted in reaction time (RT) or accuracy. The latency at which congruent and incongruent waveforms diverged was the component of interest. In simultaneous presentations, congruent and incongruent waveforms diverged earlier (circa 150 ms) among persons with ASD than among TD individuals (around 350 ms). In sequential presentations, asymmetries in the timing of neuronal processing were noted in ASD which depended on stimulus order, but these were consistent with the nature of specific perceptual strengths in this group. These findings extend the Enhanced Perceptual Functioning Model to the multisensory domain, and provide a more nuanced context for interpreting ERP findings of impaired semantic processing in ASD.

Only sparse systematic research, however, documents the thought processes associated with viewing magic tricks. With responses from over 1000 participants, here, we show how individuals construe a classic magic routine wherein a performer appears to vanish a pen. Thirty-four percent of participants correctly identified the key moment of the disappearance with only 11% thereof knowing what actions the magician actually performed to achieve the effect. Our collective findings support what magicians have known for a long time: knowing when a critical maneuver occurs hardly reveals the associated modus operandi. In line with a modern theory of attention, we discuss our results and highlight the interaction between the when and where attention modules as a necessary component of applied cognition in ecological settings.

Sex differences regarding emotional effects on memory have been recently studied through brain imaging techniques. However, the majority of investigations have often neglected to balance the variable of emotional intensity (arousal) across pleasant and unpleasant pictures. Additionally, men and women were often mixed or studied separately. The current study aims at comparing men and women's electrophysiological responses related to emotional memory of photographic material. These responses were measured using Event Related brain Potentials (ERP) in response to a task of episodic memory of emotional images. The frontal N200, the parietal P300 and the central LPC were compared in 17 men and 17 women matched for age, social economic status, education and intelligence. Behavioral results showed that, in men, reaction times were modulated by valence, whereas for women, reaction times were mainly modulated by arousal. Accuracy was affected by both emotional valence and arousal, but only in women. ERP analyses revealed that emotional valence influenced earlier time components (frontal N200 and parietal P300), whereas arousal influenced memory in the later time component (central LPC). Moreover, sex differences, mediated by valence and arousal, were found in ERP responses at different times in the processing stream. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Exome sequencing identifies a novel multiple sclerosis susceptibility variant in the TYK2 gene	NEUROLOGY			English	Article							ENVIRONMENTAL RISK-FACTORS; GENOME; MUTATIONS; ALIGNMENT; PEDIGREE; ALLELES; DISEASE; SCORES	Objective: To identify rare variants contributing to multiple sclerosis (MS) susceptibility in a family we have previously reported with up to 15 individuals affected across 4 generations. Methods: We performed exome sequencing in a subset of affected individuals to identify novel variants contributing to MS risk within this unique family. The candidate variant was genotyped in a validation cohort of 2,104 MS trio families. Results: Four family members with MS were sequenced and 21,583 variants were found to be shared among these individuals. Refining the variants to those with 1) a predicted loss of function and 2) present within regions of modest haplotype sharing identified 1 novel mutation (rs55762744) in the tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2) gene. A different polymorphism within this gene has been shown to be protective in genome-wide association studies. In contrast, the TYK2 variant identified here is a novel, missense mutation and was found to be present in 10/14 (72%) cases and 28/60 (47%) of the unaffected family members. Genotyping additional 2,104 trio families showed the variant to be transmitted preferentially from heterozygous parents (transmitted 16: not transmitted 5; chi(2) = 5.76, p = 0.016). Conclusions: Rs55762744 is a rare variant of modest effect on MS risk affecting a subset of patients (0.8%). Within this pedigree, rs55762744 is common and appears to be a modifier of modest risk effect. Exome sequencing is a quick and cost-effective method and we show here the utility of sequencing a few cases from a single, unique family to identify a novel variant. The sequencing of additional family members or other families may help identify other variants important in MS. Neurology (R) 2012; 79: 406-411	[Cader, M.

Environmental risk factors for REM sleep behavior disorder A multicenter case-control study	NEUROLOGY			English	Article							PARKINSONS-DISEASE; NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASE; DEMENTIA; METAANALYSIS; SMOKING	Objective: Idiopathic REM sleep behavior disorder is a parasomnia characterized by dream enactment and is commonly a prediagnostic sign of parkinsonism and dementia. Since risk factors have not been defined, we initiated a multicenter case-control study to assess environmental and lifestyle risk factors for REM sleep behavior disorder. Methods: Cases were patients with idiopathic REM sleep behavior disorder who were free of dementia and parkinsonism, recruited from 13 International REM Sleep Behavior Disorder Study Group centers. Controls were matched according to age and sex. Potential environmental and lifestyle risk factors were assessed via standardized questionnaire. Unconditional logistic regression adjusting for age, sex, and center was conducted to investigate the environmental factors. Results: A total of 694 participants (347 patients, 347 controls) were recruited. Among cases, mean age was 67.7 +/- 9.6 years and 81.0% were male. Cases were more likely to smoke (ever smokers = 64.0% vs 55.5%, adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 1.43, p = 0.028). Caffeine and alcohol use were not different between cases and controls. Cases were more likely to report previous head injury (19.3% vs 12.7%, OR = 1.59, p = 0.037). Cases had fewer years of formal schooling (11.1 +/- 4.4 years vs 12.7 +/- 4.3, p = 0.001), and were more likely to report having worked as farmers (19.7% vs 12.5% OR = 1.67, p = 0.022) with borderline increase in welding (17.8% vs 12.1%, OR = 1.53, p = 0.063). Previous occupational pesticide exposure was more prevalent in cases than controls (11.8% vs 6.1%, OR = 2.16, p = 0.008). Conclusions: Smoking, head injury, pesticide exposure, and farming are potential risk factors for idiopathic REM sleep behavior disorder. Neurology (R) 2012;79: 428-434	[Postuma, R.

This technique normally yields a single value per diffusion parameter per tract, potentially reducing the sensitivity for the detection of focal changes. Our goal was to spatially characterize diffusion abnormalities of fasciculi carrying temporal lobe connections. Methods: We studied 30 patients with drug-resistant TLE and 21 healthy control subjects. Twenty-four patients underwent DTI toward the end of video-EEG telemetry, with an average of 50 +/- 54 hours between the last seizure and DTI examination. After manual dissection of the uncinate and inferior longitudinal and arcuate bundle, they were spatially matched based on their distance to the temporal lobe, providing between-subject correspondence of tract segments. We evaluated point-wise differences in diffusion parameters along each tract at group and subject levels. Results: Our approach localized increased mean diffusivity restricted to or more prominent within the ipsilateral temporal lobe. These abnormalities tapered off as tracts exited the temporal lobe. We observed that the shorter the interval between the last seizure and DTI, the higher the mean diffusivity (MD) of the ipsilateral tracts. Linear discriminant analysis of tract segments correctly lateralized 87% of patients. Conclusions: The centrifugal pattern of white matter diffusion abnormalities probably reflects astrogliosis and microstructure derangement related to seizure activity in the vicinity of the focus. The negative correlation between the interval from last seizure and MD suggests a role for postictal vasogenic edema. The ability to assess tracts segmentally may contribute to a better understanding of the extent of white matter pathology in epilepsy and assist in the presurgical evaluation of patients with TLE, particularly those with unremarkable conventional imaging results.

To learn more about the normal biological and abnormal pathological role of this protein, we turned to Caenorhabditis elegans and its orthologue TDP-1. We report that TDP-1 functions in the Insulin/IGF pathway to regulate longevity and the oxidative stress response downstream from the forkhead transcription factor DAF-16/FOXO3a. However, although tdp-1 mutants are stress-sensitive, chronic upregulation of tdp-1 expression is toxic and decreases lifespan. ALS-associated mutations in TDP-43 or the related RNA binding protein FUS activate the unfolded protein response and generate oxidative stress leading to the daf-16-dependent upregulation of tdp-1 expression with negative effects on neuronal function and lifespan. Consistently, deletion of endogenous tdp-1 rescues mutant TDP-43 and FUS proteotoxicity in C. elegans. These results suggest that chronic induction of wild-type TDP1/TDP-43 by cellular stress may propagate neurodegeneration and decrease lifespan.	[Vaccaro, Alexandra; Tauffenberger, Arnaud; Parker, J.

The Vestibular System Implements a Linear-Nonlinear Transformation In Order to Encode Self-Motion	PLOS BIOLOGY			English	Article							HORIZONTAL VESTIBULOOCULAR REFLEX; SEMICIRCULAR CANAL AFFERENTS; HIGH-ACCELERATION ROTATIONS; SQUIRREL-MONKEY; NERVE AFFERENTS; HIGH-FREQUENCY; INFORMATION-TRANSMISSION; NATURAL SCENES; GAIN-CONTROL; UNILATERAL LABYRINTHECTOMY	Although it is well established that the neural code representing the world changes at each stage of a sensory pathway, the transformations that mediate these changes are not well understood. Here we show that self-motion (i.e. vestibular) sensory information encoded by VIIIth nerve afferents is integrated nonlinearly by post-synaptic central vestibular neurons. This response nonlinearity was characterized by a strong (similar to 50%) attenuation in neuronal sensitivity to low frequency stimuli when presented concurrently with high frequency stimuli. Using computational methods, we further demonstrate that a static boosting nonlinearity in the input-output relationship of central vestibular neurons accounts for this unexpected result. Specifically, when low and high frequency stimuli are presented concurrently, this boosting nonlinearity causes an intensity-dependent bias in the output firing rate, thereby attenuating neuronal sensitivities. We suggest that nonlinear integration of afferent input extends the coding range of central vestibular neurons and enables them to better extract the high frequency features of self-motion when embedded with low frequency motion during natural movements. These findings challenge the traditional notion that the vestibular system uses a linear rate code to transmit information and have important consequences for understanding how the representation of sensory information changes across sensory pathways.

J	Zatorre, RJ; Baum, SR				Zatorre, Robert J.; Baum, Shari R.			Musical Melody and Speech Intonation: Singing a Different Tune?	PLOS BIOLOGY			English	Article							HUMAN BRAIN-STEM; CONGENITAL AMUSIA; AUDITORY-CORTEX; FUNCTIONAL-ANATOMY; RIGHT-HEMISPHERE; PITCH; LANGUAGE; PERCEPTION; EXPERIENCE; ACTIVATION	Music and speech are often cited as characteristically human forms of communication. Both share the features of hierarchical structure, complex sound systems, and sensorimotor sequencing demands, and both are used to convey and influence emotions, among other functions [1]. Both music and speech also prominently use acoustical frequency modulations, perceived as variations in pitch, as part of their communicative repertoire. Given these similarities, and the fact that pitch perception and production involve the same peripheral transduction system (cochlea) and the same production mechanism (vocal tract), it might be natural to assume that pitch processing in speech and music would also depend on the same underlying cognitive and neural mechanisms. In this essay we argue that the processing of pitch information differs significantly for speech and music; specifically, we suggest that there are two pitch-related processing systems, one for more coarse-grained, approximate analysis and one for more fine-grained accurate representation, and that the latter is unique to music. More broadly, this dissociation offers clues about the interface between sensory and motor systems, and highlights the idea that multiple processing streams are a ubiquitous feature of neuro-cognitive architectures.

OBJECTIVE: To describe health care utilization and costs over a 16- to 25-year follow-up period in a cohort of preterm infants with respiratory complications. METHODS: Using provincial health administrative databases from Quebec, a cohort of individuals who were born prematurely with complications of RDS and/or BPD between 1983 and 1992 were identified. From these databases, which cover all Quebec residents, health services use, medication prescriptions, associated diagnoses and costs were tabulated. RESULTS: A total of 3442 subjects with respiratory complications following preterm birth were identified, of whom 773 had been diagnosed with BPD and 2669 had RDS without BPD. Asthma was diagnosed twice as frequently (1.7 to 2.4 times) in the BPD group compared with the RDS group, with more frequent hospital readmission, and outpatient and emergency room visits. Although respiratory causes remained the main reason for consultation in both groups, 3.7% and 3.4% of the outpatient visits were for mental or psychological ailments, such as depression, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder or dysthymia for the BPD and RDS groups, respectively. CONCLUSION: BPD patients experienced more hospital admissions, outpatient and emergency rooms visits, and were more likely to suffer from respiratory illnesses and to use respiratory drugs than RDS patients. Neurological and psychiatric complications occurred at a high frequency in both RDS and BPD subjects, and were associated with significant use of antipsychotic and antidepressant medications.

Spinal modulation of nociception by music	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PAIN			English	Article							FLEXION REFLEX; PAIN PERCEPTION; INDUCED MOOD; EMOTION; AROUSAL; ATTENTION; RESPONSES; VALENCE; PLAY	Numerous studies have demonstrated the capacity of music to modulate pain. However, the neurophysiological mechanisms responsible for this phenomenon remain unknown. In order to assess the involvement of descending modulatory mechanisms in the modulation of pain by music, we evaluated the effects of musical excerpts conveying different emotions (pleasant-stimulating, pleasant-relaxing, unpleasant-stimulating) on the spinally mediated nociceptive flexion reflex (or RIII), as well as on pain ratings and skin conductance responses. The RIII reflex and pain ratings were increased during the listening of unpleasant music compared with pleasant music, suggesting the involvement of descending pain-modulatory mechanisms in the effects of musical emotions on pain. There were no significant differences between the pleasant-stimulating and pleasant-relaxing musical condition, indicating that the arousal of music had little influence on pain processing.

Evidence for multiple extra-striate mechanisms behind perception of visual motion gradients	VISION RESEARCH			English	Article						Motion perception; Motion gradients; Bandwidths; Detection; Identification; Extra-striate	2ND-ORDER MOTION; RECEPTIVE FIELDS; MACAQUE MONKEY; HUMAN-VISION; CORTEX; MT; DISCRIMINATION; ORGANIZATION; ARCHITECTURE; SENSITIVITY	Perceiving motion patterns in visual scenes in which speed or motion direction varies over space while average luminance remains constant presents a processing task that requires at least two separate stages of neural spatio-temporal filtering. We have previously probed the transfer of information between these stages of filtering identifying a largely scale invariant process in which narrowband initial motion sensitive filters are coupled with a broad range of spatial frequencies of secondary filters, with an optimal coupling - in terms of optimal observer visual sensitivity - at a frequency ratio of around twelve. In the current work, we used the same stimulus to investigate the possible presence of multiple secondary filtering mechanisms and their associated bandwidths. Using a forced choice psychophysical task with both a detection and an identification component, we presented experimental blocks containing stimuli with one of two different modulator frequencies in each trial to measure the frequency difference at which the detection performance matched the identification of the frequency. We found that at a frequency differences of about 2.2 octaves, performance of both tasks was similar, and the processing could therefore be inferred to occur in independent frequency channels. The same observation was confirmed for stimuli presented at a longer viewing distance. We conclude that for the motion gradient stimuli, there are secondary filtering mechanisms with a moderately broad bandwidth of over 2 octaves that underlie our sensitivity for detecting motion gradients of different modulation frequency. These are likely to be implemented at least in part within the dorsal stream of extra-striate cortex. (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Reduced brain levels of DHEAS in hepatic coma patients: Significance for increased GABAergic tone in hepatic encephalopathy	NEUROCHEMISTRY INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						Hepatic encephalopathy; Neurosteroids; Allopregnanolone; DHEAS; Increased GABAergic tone	PRIMARY BILIARY-CIRRHOSIS; DEHYDROEPIANDROSTERONE-SULFATE; POSTMENOPAUSAL WOMEN; GABA(A) RECEPTOR; SEX-HORMONES; STEROIDS; IMPROVES; FATIGUE; PLASMA; REPLACEMENT	Increased neurosteroids with allosteric modulatory activity on GABA(A) receptors such as 3 alpha-5 alpha-tertrahydroprogesterone; allopregnanolone (AUG), are candidates to explain the phenomenon of "increased GABAergic tone" in hepatic encephalopathy (HE). However, it is not known how changes of other GABAA receptor modulators such as dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) contribute to altered GABAergic tone in HE. Concentrations of DHEAS were measured by radioimmunoassay in frontal cortex samples obtained at autopsy from 11 cirrhotic patients who died in hepatic coma and from an equal number of controls matched for age, gender, and autopsy delay intervals free from hepatic or neurological diseases. To assess whether reduced brain DHEAS contributes to increased GABAergic tone, in vitro patch clamp recordings in rat prefrontal cortex neurons were performed. A significant reduction of DHEAS (5.81 +/- 0.88 ng/g tissue) compared to control values (9.70 +/- 0.79 ng/g, p < 0.01) was found. Brain levels of DHEAS in patients with liver disease who died without HE (11.43 +/- 1.74 ng/g tissue), and in a patient who died in uremic coma (12.56 ng/g tissue) were within the control range. Increasing ALLO enhances GABAergic tonic currents concentration-dependently, but increasing DHEAS reduces these currents. High concentrations of DHEAS (50 mu M) reduce GABAergic tonic currents in the presence of ALLO, whereas reduced concentrations of DHEAS (1 mu M) further stimulate these currents. These findings demonstrate that decreased concentrations of DHEAS together with increased brain concentrations of ALLO increase GABAergic tonic currents synergistically; suggesting that reduced brain DHEAS could further increase GABAergic tone in human HE.

Dynamic Neural Units for Adaptive Magnetic Attitude Control of Spacecraft	JOURNAL OF GUIDANCE CONTROL AND DYNAMICS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	AAS/AIAA Astrodynamics Specialist Conference	AUG 02-05, 2010	Toronto, CANADA	Amer Astronaut Soc (AAS), Amer Inst Aeronaut & Astronaut (AIAA)			GRAVITY GRADIENT; RIGID SPACECRAFT; NETWORKS; STABILIZATION; SATELLITES; ACTUATORS; SYSTEMS	A neural network based on dynamic neural units has the capability to handle any type of nonlinearity. In addition, it can adapt itself to parameter changes in real time. In this paper, such a dynamic neural network is used to design a controller through inverse modeling to address the attitude control of an Earth-pointing magnetically actuated spacecraft. Furthermore, normalization of weights of the dynamic neural units is proposed to ensure their convergence for proper learning. The dynamic neural controller developed in this paper, being adaptive, not only takes care of any unknown disturbance torques, but it is also robust and can adapt itself if there are any large changes in the parameters in the plant, such as the moments of inertia. It is shown, that the stabilization accuracy of the plant is better under the proposed neural controller as compared with a proportional-derivate controller. Proof of stability, for the dynamic neural units and the system as a whole, is also presented.

Loss of TNR impairs cognition, synaptic plasticity and motor abilities in mice, however its role in human neurodevelopment and cognition is less clear. Methods and results The authors present the case of a child with intellectual disability and transient choreoathetosis. Array genomic hybridisation revealed a homozygous deletion involving only two genes, including TNR. Sequencing TNR in a cohort of 219 patients with intellectual disability did not identify any potential pathogenic mutations. Conclusion This is the first report of a complete loss of TNR associated with intellectual disability. This study provides evidence of the important role of TNR in brain development and cognition in humans.

First published May 2, 2012; doi:10.1152/jn.00592.2011.-During simple sensorimotor decision making, neurons in the parietal cortex extract evidence from sensory information provided by visual areas until a decision is reached. Contextual information can bias parietal activity during the task and change the decision-making parameters. One type of contextual information is the availability of reward for correct decisions. We tested the hypothesis that the frontal lobes and basal ganglia use contextual information to bias decision making to maximize reward. Human volunteers underwent functional MRI while making decisions about the motion of dots on a computer monitor. On rewarded trials, subjects responded more slowly by increasing the threshold to decision. Rewarded trials were associated with activation in the ventral striatum and prefrontal cortex in the period preceding coherent dot motion, and the degree of activation predicted the increased decision threshold. Decreasing dopamine transmission, using a tyrosine-depleting amino acid mixture, abolished the reward-related corticostriatal activation and eliminated the correlation between striatal activity and decision threshold. These observations provide direct evidence that some reward-related functional MRI signals in the striatum are the result of dopamine neuron activity and demonstrate that mesolimbic dopamine transmission can influence perceptual and decision-making neural processes engaged to maximize reward harvest.

Discovery of Novel Glucose-Regulated Proteins in Isolated Human Pancreatic Islets Using LC-MS/MS-Based Proteomics	JOURNAL OF PROTEOME RESEARCH			English	Article						human; pancreatic islet; glucose; type 2 diabetes; proteomics; mass spectrometry; LC-MS/MS	GENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION; 2-DIMENSIONAL GEL-ELECTROPHORESIS; MAMMALIAN MITOCHONDRIAL RIBOSOME; TANDEM MASS-SPECTROMETRY; TRANS-GOLGI NETWORK; GENE-EXPRESSION; BETA-CELL; INSULIN-SECRETION; INTERACTING PROTEIN; SHOTGUN PROTEOMICS	The prevalence of diabetes mellitus is increasing dramatically throughout the world, and the disease has become a major public health issue. The most common form of the disease, type 2 diabetes, is characterized by insulin resistance and insufficient insulin production from the pancreatic beta-cell. Since glucose is the most potent regulator of beta-cell function under physiological conditions, identification of the insulin secretory defect underlying type 2 diabetes requires a better understanding of glucose regulation of human beta-cell function. To this aim, a bottom-up LC-MS/MS-based proteomics approach was used to profile pooled islets from multiple donors under basal (5 mM) or high (1.5 mM) glucose conditions. Our analysis discovered 256 differentially abundant proteins (similar to p < 0.05) after 24 h of high glucose exposure from more than 4500 identified in total. Several novel glucose-regulated proteins were elevated under high glucose conditions, including regulators of mRNA splicing (pleiotropic regulator 1), processing (retinoblastoma binding protein 6), and function (nuclear RNA export factor 1), in addition to neuron navigator I and plasminogen activator inhibitor 1. Proteins whose abundances markedly decreased during incubation at 15 mM glucose included Bax inhibitor 1 and synaptotagmin-17. Up-regulation of dicer 1 and SLC27A2 and down-regulation of phospholipase C beta 4 were confirmed by Western blots. Many proteins found to be differentially abundant after high glucose stimulation are annotated as uncharacterized or hypothetical. These findings expand our knowledge of glucose regulation of the human islet proteome and suggest many hitherto unknown responses to glucose that require additional studies to explore novel functional roles.

This implantable device includes a neural signal amplifier, an asynchronous seizure detector, a drug delivery system (DDS) including a micropump, and a hybrid subdural electrode (HSE). The asynchronous detection algorithm is based on data-dependent analysis and validated with Matlab tools. The detector and DDS have a power saving mode. The HSE contacts are made of Platinum (Pt) encapsulated with polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). Given the heterogeneity of electrographic seizure signals and seizure suppression threshold, the implantable device provides tunable parameters facility through an external transmitter to adapt to each individual's neurophysiology prior to clinical deployment. The proposed detector and DDS were assembled in circle divide 50 mm and circle divide 30 mm circular printed circuit boards, respectively. The detector was validated using icEEG recordings of seven patients who had previously undergone an intracranial investigation for epilepsy surgery. The triggering of the DDS was tested and a predefined seizure suppression dose was delivered similar to 16 s after electrographical seizure onsets. The device's power consumption was reduced by 12% in active mode and 49% in power saving mode compared to similar seizure detection algorithms implemented with synchronous architecture.

Human eye-head gaze shifts preserve their accuracy and spatiotemporal trajectory profiles despite long-duration torque perturbations that assist or oppose head motion. J Neurophysiol 108: 39-56, 2012. First published March 28, 2012; doi:10.1152/jn.01092.2011.-Humans routinely use coordinated eye-head gaze saccades to rapidly and accurately redirect the line of sight (Land MF. Vis Neurosci 26: 51-62, 2009). With a fixed body, the gaze control system combines visual, vestibular, and neck proprioceptive sensory information and coordinates two moving platforms, the eyes and head. Classic engineering tools have investigated the structure of motor systems by testing their ability to compensate for perturbations. When a reaching movement of the hand is subjected to an unexpected force field of random direction and strength, the trajectory is deviated and its final position is inaccurate. Here, we found that the gaze control system behaves differently. We perturbed horizontal gaze shifts with long-duration torques applied to the head that unpredictably either assisted or opposed head motion and very significantly altered the intended head trajectory. We found, as others have with brief head perturbations, that gaze accuracy was preserved. Unexpectedly, we found also that the eye compensated well-with saccadic and rollback movements-for long-duration head perturbations such that resulting gaze trajectories remained close to that when the head was not perturbed. However, the ocular compensation was best when torques assisted, compared with opposed, head motion. If the vestibuloocular reflex (VOR) is suppressed during gaze shifts, as currently thought, what caused invariant gaze trajectories and accuracy, early eye-direction reversals, and asymmetric compensations? We propose three mechanisms: a gaze feedback loop that generates a gaze-position error signal; a vestibular-to-oculomotor signal that dissociates self-generated from passively imposed head motion; and a saturation element that limits orbital eye excursion.

Incomplete spinal cord injury promotes durable functional changes within the spinal locomotor circuitry. J Neurophysiol 108: 124-134, 2012. First published April 4, 2012; doi:10.1152/jn.00073.2012.-While walking in a straight path, changes in speed result mainly from adjustments in the duration of the stance phase while the swing phase remains relatively invariant, a basic feature of the spinal central pattern generator (CPG). To produce a broad range of locomotor behaviors, the CPG has to integrate modulatory inputs from the brain and the periphery and alter these swing/stance characteristics. In the present work we raise the issue as to whether the CPG can adapt or reorganize in response to a chronic change of supraspinal inputs, as is the case after spinal cord injury (SCI). Kinematic data obtained from six adult cats walking at different treadmill speeds were collected to calculate the cycle and subphase duration at different stages after a first spinal hemisection at T-10 and after a subsequent complete SCI at T-13 respectively aimed at disconnecting unilaterally and then totally the spinal cord from its supraspinal inputs. The results show, first, that the neural control of locomotion is flexible and responsive to a partial or total loss of supraspinal inputs. Second, we demonstrate that a hemisection induces durable plastic changes within the spinal locomotor circuitry below the lesion. In addition, this study gives new insights into the organization of the spinal CPG for locomotion such that phases of the step cycle (swing, stance) can be independently regulated for adapting to speed and also that the CPGs controlling the left and right hindlimbs can, up to a point, be regulated independently.

Here we report that the fakir phenotype is caused by a missense mutation in the gene encoding voltage-gated calcium channel 2.1b (CACNA1Ab). Injection of RNA encoding wild-type CaV2.1 restores touch responsiveness in fakir mutants, whereas knockdown of CACNA1Ab via morpholino oligonucleotides recapitulates the fakir mutant phenotype. Fakir mutants display normal current-evoked synaptic communication at the neuromuscular junction but have attenuated touch-evoked activation of motor neurons. NMDA-evoked fictive swimming is not affected by the loss of CaV2.1b, suggesting that this channel is not required for motor pattern generation. These results, coupled with the expression of CACNA1Ab by sensory neurons, suggest that CaV2.1b channel activity is necessary for touch-evoked activation of the locomotor network in zebrafish.

Less is known about the role of psychosocial factors such as stress and social relationships for cognitive functioning. Speakers in Session IV of the Summit focused on possible mechanisms linking social interactions and stressful experiences to cognitive changes with aging. Elevated cortisol, repetitive thinking, negative emotions, neuroticism, chronic stress, and early life adversity were negatively associated with memory and other cognitive dimensions in later life. In contrast, supportive social relationships were found to be positively related to cognitive functioning. Some evidence was provided for multidirectional, causal relationships involving stress and negative affect as both antecedents and consequences of cognitive decline. The findings contribute to understanding the potential underlying causal processes linking psychosocial factors and cognitive aging with a developmental focus on the etiology of declines and onset of cognitive impairments. This work provides an important foundation for future research to identify modifiable factors and to design interventions to minimize cognitive declines and optimize cognitive health in adulthood.

Tyrosine phosphorylation of Dab1 at two YQXI and two YXVP motifs recruits multiple SH2 domains, resulting in activation of a wide range of signaling cascades. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the coordinated regulation of Dab1 downstream effectors remain poorly understood. Here, we show that alternative splicing results in inclusion of different combinations of YQXI and YXVP motifs in Dab1 isoforms during development. Dab1 variants with partial or complete loss of YQXI motifs are preferentially expressed at early developmental stages, whereas the commonly studied Dab1 is predominantly expressed at late developmental stages. Expression of Dab1 variants in 293T and Neuro2a cells reveals reduced levels or absence of tyrosine phosphorylation in variants that have lost one or both YQXI motifs. We further demonstrate that Dab1 variants differ in their abilities to activate Src and recruit distinct SH2 domains involved in specific downstream signaling pathways. We propose that coordinated expression of specific Dab1 isoforms in different populations of cells in the developing brain contributes to precise neuronal migration by modulating the activity of subsets of Dab1 downstream effectors.

Treatment of HIV infection is limited by high rates of adverse drug reactions and development of resistance in a significant proportion of patients as a result of suboptimal drug concentrations. The efficacy of antiretroviral therapy is challenged by the emergence of resistant HIV-1 mutants with reduced susceptibility to antiretroviral drugs. Moreover, pharmacotherapy of patients infected with HIV is challenging because a great number of comorbidities increase polypharmacy and the risk for drug-drug interactions. Drug-metabolizing enzymes and drug transporters regulate drug access to the systemic circulation, target cells, and sanctuary sites. These factors, which determine drug exposure, along with the emergence of mutations conferring resistance to HIV medications, could explain variability in efficacy and adverse drug reactions associated with antiretroviral drugs. In this review, the major factors affecting the disposition of antiretroviral drugs, including key drug-metabolizing enzymes and membrane drug transporters, are outlined. Genetic polymorphisms affecting the activity and/or the expression of cytochromes P450 or UGT isozymes and membrane drug transport proteins are highlighted and include such examples as the association of neurotoxicity with efavirenz, nephrotoxicity with tenofovir, hepatotoxicity with nevirapine, and hyperbilirubinemia with indinavir and atazanavir. Mechanisms of drug resistance conferred by specific viral mutations are also reviewed, with particular attention to replicative viral fitness and transmitted HIV drug resistance with the objectives of providing a better understanding of mechanisms involved in HIV drug resistance and helping health care providers to better manage interpatient variability in drug efficacy and toxicity.

Cells were either cultured alone or cocultured with rat dorsal root ganglia neurons (DRGNs). When cultured alone, both the A2B5- and PDGFR alpha-selected cells exhibited age-dependent increases in early to mid-stage lineage markers, including sulfatides (O4 antibody) and the transcription factor Olig2, while the cell death rate correlated negatively with age. In coculture with neurons, cells also expressed the myelin components galactocerebroside (GC) and myelin basic protein (MBP), and ensheathed axons. In DRGN cocultures, A2B5+ cells derived from >19 gw produced more GC+/MBP+ cells compared with the 15-17-week cells. The number of GC+ cells making axonal contacts, and ensheathing axonal segments per cell increased proportionally to gestational age. This age-dependent difference in GC/MBP cell number and capacity to ensheath axons persisted when PDGFR alpha selection was used to enrich for the number of OPCs in cultures derived from younger ages.

Retrograde and Wallerian Axonal Degeneration Occur Synchronously after Retinal Ganglion Cell Axotomy	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PATHOLOGY			English	Article							NERVE-FIBER LAYER; IN-VIVO; PERIPHERAL-NERVE; OPTIC-NERVE; GROWTH CONE; APOPTOSIS; TRANSPORT; RAT; REGENERATION; SURVIVAL	Axonal injury and degeneration are pivotal pathological events in diseases of the nervous system. In the past decade, it has been recognized that the process of axonal degeneration is distinct from somal degeneration and that axoprotective strategies may be distinct from those that protect the soma. Preserving the cell body via neuroprotection cannot improve function if the axon is damaged, because the soma is still disconnected from its target. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms of axonal degeneration is critical for developing new therapeutic interventions for axonal disease treatment. We combined in vivo imaging with a multilaser confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscope and in vivo axotomy with a diode-pumped solid-state laser to assess the time course of Wallerian and retrograde degeneration of unmyelinated retinal ganglion cell axons in living rats for 4 weeks after intraretinal axotomy. Laser injury resulted in reproducible axon loss both distal and proximal to the site of injury. Longitudinal polarization-sensitive imaging of axons demonstrated that Wallerian and retrograde degeneration occurred synchronously. Neurofilament immunostaining of retinal whole-mounts confirmed axonal loss and demonstrated sparing of adjacent axons to the axotomy site. In vivo fluorescent imaging of axonal transport and photobleaching of labeled axons demonstrated that the laser axotomy model did not affect adjacent axon function. These results are consistent with a shared mechanism for Wallerian and retrograde degeneration.

Variations in the quality of the early environment are associated with alterations in DNA methylation in rodents, and recent data suggest similar processes in humans in response to early-life adversity. Objective: To determine genome-wide DNA methylation alterations induced by early-life trauma. Design: Genome-wide study of promoter methylation in individuals with severe abuse during childhood. Patients, Setting, and Main Outcome Measures: Promoter DNA methylation levels were profiled using methylated DNA immunoprecipitation followed by microarray hybridization in hippocampal tissue from 41 French-Canadian men (25 with a history of severe childhood abuse and 16 control subjects). Methylation profiles were compared with corresponding genome-wide gene expression profiles obtained by messenger RNA microarrays. Methylation differences between groups were validated on neuronal and nonneuronal DNA fractions isolated by fluorescence-assisted cell sorting. Functional consequences of site-specific promoter methylation were assessed by luciferase assays. Results: We identified 362 differentially methylated promoters in individuals with a history of abuse compared with controls. Among these promoters, 248 showed hypermethylation and 114 demonstrated hypomethylation. Validation and site-specific quantification of DNA methylation in the 5 most hypermethylated gene promoters indicated that methylation differences occurred mainly in the neuronal cellular fraction. Genes involved in cellular/neuronal plasticity were among the most significantly differentially methylated, and, among these, Alsin (ALS2) was the most significant finding. Methylated ALS2 constructs mimicking the methylation state in samples from abused suicide completers showed decreased promoter transcriptional activity associated with decreased hippocampal expression of ALS2 variants. Conclusion: Childhood adversity is associated with epigenetic alterations in the promoters of several genes in hippocampal neurons.

Despite the widespread use of opioids in pregnant and lactating women for the treatment of acute pain, few studies have investigated the interplay of genetic factors and pregnancy-related physiological alterations in relation to opioid metabolism and response. Some interesting avenues of research require further pursuit-including evidence of cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) induction during pregnancy and its effect on the generation of the active opioid metabolites morphine, oxymorphone, O-desmethyltramadol, and hydromorphone following the administration of codeine, oxycodone, tramadol, and hydrocodone respectively. Studies investigating the duration of maternal CYP2D6 induction after delivery are also needed to shed light on genotype to phenotype correlations in breastfeeding mothers using opioid analgesics in the postpartum period.

Drug-Loaded Nanocarriers: Passive Targeting and Crossing of Biological Barriers	CURRENT MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY			English	Review						Biological barriers; drug delivery; nanocarrier; oral administration; passive targeting; pulmonary administration; surface properties; vascular endothelium	BLOOD-BRAIN-BARRIER; SOLID LIPID NANOPARTICLES; CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; PLASMA-PROTEIN ADSORPTION; INCREASED MICROVASCULAR PERMEABILITY; LONG-CIRCULATING NANOPARTICLES; RECEPTOR-MEDIATED ENDOCYTOSIS; PH-RESPONSIVE NANOPARTICLES; ENDOTHELIAL GROWTH-FACTOR; HUMAN TUMOR XENOGRAFT	Poor bioavailability and poor pharmacokinetic characteristics are some of the leading causes of drug development failure. Therefore, poorly-soluble drugs, fragile proteins or nucleic acid products may benefit from their encapsulation in nanosized vehicles, providing enhanced solubilization, protection against degradation, and increased access to pathological compartments. A key element for the success of drug-loaded nanocarriers is their ability to either cross biological barriers themselves, or allow loaded drugs to traverse them to achieve optimal pharmacological action at pathological sites. Depending on the mode of administration, nanocarriers may have to cross different physiological barriers in their journey towards their target. In this review, the crossing of biological barriers by passive targeting strategies will be presented for intravenous delivery (vascular endothelial lining, particularly for tumor vasculature and blood brain barrier targeting), oral administration (gastrointestinal lining), and upper airway administration (pulmonary epithelium). For each specific barrier, background information will be provided on the structure and biology of the tissues involved as well as available pathways for nano-objects or loaded drugs (diffusion and convection through fenestration, transcytosis, tight junction crossing, etc.). The determinants of passive targeting - size, shape, surface chemistry, surface patterning of nanovectors - will be discussed in light of current results. Perspectives on each mode of administration will be presented. The focus will be on polymeric nanoparticles and dendrimers, although advances in liposome technology will be also reported as they represent the largest body in the drug delivery literature.

The K16N mutation is located exactly at the a-secretase cleavage site and influences both APP and A beta. First, due to the K16N mutation APP secretion is affected and a higher amount of A beta peptides is being produced. Second, A beta peptides carrying the K16N mutation are unique in that the peptide itself is not harmful to neuronal cells. Severe toxicity, however, is evident upon equimolar mixture of wt and mutant peptides, mimicking the heterozygous state of the subject. Furthermore, A beta 42 K16N inhibits fibril formation of A beta 42 wild-type. Even more, A beta 42 K16N peptides are protected against clearance activity by the major A beta-degrading enzyme neprilysin. Thus the mutation characterized here harbours a combination of risk factors that synergistically may contribute to the development of early onset Alzheimer disease.

Leading atlases of the human brain are inconsistent with each other in terms of the number of branches identified and the nomenclature used to refer to them. Examination of the magnetic resonance images (MRIs) of 45 human brains (90 hemispheres) demonstrates three branches of the cSTS that ascend into the inferior parietal lobule: an anterior branch (cSTS1), a central branch (cSTS2) and a posterior branch (cSTS3). The cSTS1 is found immediately posterior to the ascending limb of the Sylvian fissure, followed by the cSTS2, and then the last branch, cSTS3, at the parieto-occipital junction. The temporal part of the STS joins most frequently with the cSTS2 (approximately 60% of cases), the cSTS1 (approximately 30% of cases) and least frequently with the cSTS3 (approximately 10% of cases). At the temporo-occipital junction, there is another sulcus that is related to the STS, the ventral anterior occipital sulcus (AOCS-v), a sulcus that has been functionally linked to area MT/v5 in the human brain. While the STS may appear to join AOCS-v from the surface of the brain, it can be established from examination of the depth of the sulci that they are not continuous. The variability in location of each one of the cSTS branches is expressed quantitatively in the MNI standard proportional stereotaxic space.

At present, they are obtained by laboratory titration on samples taken from the production process. Due to the delays in taking and testing samples, they cannot be used for real-time control and optimization. Existing online measurements are not adopted because of the characteristics of the sodium aluminate solution such as high viscosity and the ease of precipitation which leads to pipeline blocking and decreased precision. In this paper, a new modeling method is proposed to measure the component concentrations online using the measurements of conductivity and temperature. The method combines the partial least squares (PLS) technique and the Hammerstein recurrent neural networks (HRNN), where a stable learning algorithm with theoretical analysis is given for the HRNN model. For this PLS-based HRNN, the PLS technique is used to solve the high dimensional and correlated data. Meanwhile, the HRNN technique is used to fit the nonlinear and dynamic characters of the process. An industrial experimental study on a sodium aluminate solution is described. The experiment results show that the proposed method is sufficient to warrant further evaluation in industrial scale experiments.

Although a frequent topic of study, changes of CBF and CMRO2 during normal aging are still controversial, as some authors find decreases of both CBF and CMRO2 but increased OEF, while others find no change, and yet other find divergent changes. In this reanalysis of previously published results from positron emission tomography of healthy volunteers, we determined CMRO2 and CBF in 66 healthy volunteers aged 21 to 81 years. The magnitudes of CMRO2 and CBF declined in large parts of the cerebral cortex, including association areas, but the primary motor and sensory areas were relatively spared. We found significant increases of OEF in frontal and parietal cortices, excluding primary motor and somatosensory regions, and in the temporal cortex. Because of the inverse relation between OEF and capillary oxygen tension, increased OEF can compromise oxygen delivery to neurons, with possible perturbation of energy turnover. The results establish a possible mechanism of progression from healthy to unhealthy brain aging, as the regions most affected by age are the areas that are most vulnerable to neurodegeneration.

Five inborn errors affecting folate transport and metabolism have been well studied: hereditary folate malabsorption, caused by mutations in the gene encoding the proton-coupled folate transporter (SLC46A1); glutamate formiminotransferase deficiency, caused by mutations in the FTCD gene; methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase deficiency, caused by mutations in the MTHFR gene; and functional methionine synthase deficiency, either as the result of mutations affecting methionine synthase itself (cblG, caused by mutations in the MTR gene) or affecting the accessory protein methionine synthase reductase (cblE, caused by mutations in the MTRR gene). Recently additional inborn errors have been identified. Cerebral folate deficiency is a clinically heterogeneous disorder, which in a few families is caused by mutations in the FOLR1 gene. Dihydrofolate reductase deficiency is characterized by megaloblastic anemia and cerebral folate deficiency, with variable neurological findings. It is caused by mutations in the DHFR gene. Deficiency in the trifunctional enzyme containing methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase, methenyltetrahydrofolate cyclohydrolase and formyltetrahydrofolate synthetase activities, has been identified in a single patient with megaloblastic anemia, atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome and severe combined immune deficiency. It is caused by mutations in the MTHFD1 gene.

Current treatment limitations are attributed to the precarious locations within the brain where such tumors grow, their highly infiltrative nature precluding complete resection and lack of specificity among agents capable of attenuating their growth. Here, we show that in vitro, glioma cells of diverse origins internalize a peptide encompassing a tubulin-binding site (TBS) on the neurofilament light protein. The internalized peptide disrupts the microtubule network, inhibits migration and proliferation, and leads to apoptosis. Using an intracerebral transplant model, we show that most, if not all, of these responses to peptide exposure also occur in vivo. Notably, a single intratumor injection significantly attenuates tumor growth, while neither peptide uptake nor downstream consequences are observed elsewhere in the host nervous system. Such preferential uptake suggests that the peptide may have potential as a primary or supplementary glioblastoma treatment modality by exploiting its autonomous microtubule-disrupting activity or engaging its capacity to selectively target glioma cells with other cell-disrupting cargos.

Whereas BPD patients show deficits on neuropsychological tests of response inhibition, it is unknown whether these deficits are also present in their first-degree biological relatives who are at an increased genetic risk for this illness. The purpose of the current study was to identify and characterize a subgroup of BPD patients with pronounced response inhibition deficits, and secondarily, to estimate the relative recurrence risk of these deficits among affected families. Method: Thirty-nine pairs of female BPD probands and their unaffected first-degree biological sisters were recruited from hospital outpatient clinics. Participants completed the Conners' Continuous Performance Test (CPT) and the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale-11. Results: BPD relatives made a similar number of commission errors on the CPT compared to healthy controls with no personal or family history of psychiatric illness; however, cluster analysis revealed a subgroup of BPD relatives who displayed clinically elevated commission errors and atypically fast RTs to target stimuli, indicating a genuine response inhibition deficit. The estimated relative recurrence risk for response inhibition deficits for all sibling pairs on the CPT was moderate at lambda = 4.55. Conclusions: These findings suggest that response inhibition deficits are pronounced in some BPD relatives, may be heritable between siblings, are nonredundant with diagnostic status, and show promise as candidate neuropsychological endophenotypes for BPD.

Prenatal Synthetic Glucocorticoid Treatment Changes DNA Methylation States in Male Organ Systems: Multigenerational Effects	ENDOCRINOLOGY			English	Article							PITUITARY-ADRENAL FUNCTION; RECEPTOR MESSENGER-RNA; GUINEA-PIG BRAIN; DIETARY-PROTEIN RESTRICTION; ANTENATAL CORTICOSTEROIDS; GENE-EXPRESSION; LUMINOMETRIC METHYLATION; EPIGENETIC REGULATION; NUTRIENT RESTRICTION; PATERNAL LINEAGE	Prenatal synthetic glucocorticoids (sGC) are administered to pregnant women at risk of delivering preterm, approximately 10% of all pregnancies. Animal studies have demonstrated that offspring exposed to elevated glucocorticoids, either by administration of sGC or as a result of maternal stress, are at increased risk of developing behavioral, endocrine, and metabolic abnormalities. DNA methylation is a covalent modification of DNA that plays a critical role in long-lasting programming of gene expression. Here we tested the hypothesis that prenatal sGC treatment has both acute and long-term effects on DNA methylation states in the fetus and offspring and that these effects extend into a subsequent generation. Pregnant guinea pigs were treated with sGC in late gestation, and methylation analysis by luminometric methylation assay was undertaken in organs from fetuses and offspring across two generations. Expression of genes that modify the epigenetic state were measured by quantitative real-time PCR. Results indicate that there are organ-specific developmental trajectories of methylation in the fetus and newborn. Furthermore, these trajectories are substantially modified by intrauterine exposure to sGC. These sGC-induced changes in DNA methylation remain into adulthood and are evident in the next generation. Furthermore, prenatal sGC exposure alters the expression of several genes encoding proteins that modulate the epigenetic state. Several of these changes are long lasting and are also present in the next generation. These data support the hypothesis that prenatal sGC exposure leads to broad changes in critical components of the epigenetic machinery and that these effects can pass to the next generation.

This secondary damage leads to further exacerbation of tissue loss and functional impairments. The immune responses that are triggered by injury are complex and are mediated by a variety of factors that have both detrimental and beneficial effects. In this review, we focus on the diverse effects of the phospholipase A(2) (PLA(2)) superfamily and the downstream pathways that generate a large number of bioactive lipid mediators, some of which have pro-inflammatory and demyelinating effects, whereas others have anti-inflammatory and pro-resolution properties. For each of these lipid mediators, we provide an overview followed by a discussion of their expression and role in SCI. Where appropriate, we have compared the latter with their role in other neurological conditions. The PLA(2) pathway provides a number of targets for therapeutic intervention for the treatment of SCI and other neurological conditions.

Identification of a novel in-frame de novo mutation in SPTAN1 in intellectual disability and pontocerebellar atrophy	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF HUMAN GENETICS			English	Article						intellectual disability; epilepsy; SPTAN1; pontocerebellar atrophy	SPECTRIN	Heterozygous in-frame mutations (p.E2207del and p.R2308_M2309dup) in the alpha-II subunit of spectrin (SPTAN1) were recently identified in two patients with intellectual disability (ID), infantile spasms (IS), hypomyelination, and brain atrophy. These mutations affected the C-terminal domain of the protein, which contains the nucleation site of the alpha/beta spectrin heterodimer. By screening SPTAN1 in 95 patients with idiopathic ID, we found a de novo in-frame mutation (p.Q2202del) in the same C-terminal domain in a patient with mild generalized epilepsy and pontocerebellar atrophy, but without IS, hypomyelination, or other brain structural defects, allowing us to define the core phenotype associated with these C-terminal SPTAN1 mutations. We also found a de novo missense variant (p.R566P) of unclear clinical significance in a patient with non-syndromic ID. These two mutations induced different patterns of aggregation between spectrin subunits in transfected neuronal cell lines, providing a paradigm for the classification of candidate variants.

Dissociable pathways facilitate theta and non-theta states in the median raphe-Septohippocampal circuit	HIPPOCAMPUS			English	Article						median raphe; medial septum; serotonin; acetylcholine; hippocampal theta	URETHANE-ANESTHETIZED RATS; HIPPOCAMPAL-THETA; MIDBRAIN RAPHE; VESICULAR GLUTAMATE; GABAERGIC NEURONS; DIAGONAL BAND; GLUTAMATERGIC/ASPARTATERGIC PROJECTIONS; SUPRAMAMMILLARY NUCLEUS; INHIBITORY INTERNEURONS; SEROTONERGIC CONTROL	Hippocampal theta rhythms in vivo are modulated by a synchronizing projection from the medial septum (MS) and a desynchronizing input from the median raphe nucleus (MRn) of the brainstem. Inactivation of the MS suppresses theta rhythms while inactivation of the median raphe produces persistent theta. However, different pathways arise from within the MS and the median raphe and therefore different brain states could be facilitated by different forms of median raphe or septohippocampal inputs. Here, we found in urethane anesthetized rats that suppression of outputs from the MRn with procaine leads to persistent hippocampal theta as previously reported. The discharge properties of hippocampal theta-related cells recorded during both spontaneously occurring theta and MRn 8-OH-DPAT-induced theta did not differ significantly. This persistent theta was abolished by inactivation of the MS with either procaine or atropine sulfate. Selective inactivation of serotonergic median raphe outputs with the 5-HT-1A agonist (8-OH-DPAT) induced theta that was also abolished by medial septal inactivation using procaine. Thus, persistent theta following complete median raphe inactivation or selective serotonergic inactivation arises from a median raphe to MS pathway. However, 8-OH-DPAT infusions into the median raphe together with atropine infusions in the MS did not abolish theta activity. These data suggest that the non-serotonergic (possibly glutamatergic) median raphe projections to the MS can facilitate the generation of hippocampal theta in the absence of medial septal cholinergic tone. These results demonstrate that dissociable neuronal pathways in the median rapheMShippocampal circuit promote different brain states (theta or non-theta) and a median raphe non-serotonergic (likely glutamatergic) system may serve a separate function from the ascending serotonergic raphe projection in the regulation of hippocampal network activity.

Baseline NT-proBNP and biomarkers of inflammation and necrosis in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction: insights from the APEX-AMI trial	JOURNAL OF THROMBOSIS AND THROMBOLYSIS			English	Article						N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide; Interleukin-6; Interleukin-10; C-reactive protein	BRAIN NATRIURETIC PEPTIDE; ANTIINFLAMMATORY CYTOKINE INTERLEUKIN-10; PERCUTANEOUS CORONARY INTERVENTION; CONGESTIVE-HEART-FAILURE; EJECTION FRACTION; RISK STRATIFICATION; PRIMARY ANGIOPLASTY; MESSENGER-RNA; SERUM-LEVELS; ACUTE-PHASE	Coronary plaque rupture is associated with a systemic inflammatory response. The relationship between baseline N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), a prognostic marker in patients with acute coronary syndromes, and systemic inflammatory mediators in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is not well described. Of 5,745 STEMI patients treated with primary PCI in the APEX-AMI trial, we evaluated the relationship between baseline NT-proBNP levels and baseline levels of inflammatory markers and markers of myonecrosis in a subset of 772 who were enrolled in a biomarker substudy. Spearman correlations (r (s)) were calculated between baseline NT-proBNP levels and a panel of ten systemic inflammatory biomarkers. Interleukin (IL)-6, a pro-inflammatory cytokine, was significantly positively correlated with NT-proBNP (r (s) = 0.317, P < 0.001). In a sensitivity analysis excluding all heart failure patients, the correlation between baseline IL-6 and NT-proBNP remained significant (n = 651, r (s) = 0.296, P < 0.001). A positive association was also observed with high sensitivity C-reactive protein (r (s) = 0.377, P < 0.001) and there was a weak negative correlation with the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 (r (s) = -0.109, P = 0.003). No other significant correlations were observed among the other testes inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. In STEMI patients undergoing primary PCI, the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 was modestly correlated with baseline NT-proBNP levels. This relationship remained significant in patients without heart failure. This finding is consistent with pre-clinical and clinical research suggesting that systemic inflammation may influence NT-proBNP expression independently of myocardial stretch.

MK5-deficient mice displayed impaired dendritic spine formation in mouse hippocampal neurons in vivo. We performed large-scale interaction screens to understand the neuronal functions of the ERK3/MK5 pathway and identified septin7 (Sept7) as a novel interacting partner of ERK3. ERK3/MK5/Sept7 form a ternary complex, which can phosphorylate the Sept7 regulators Binders of Rho GTPases (Borgs). In addition, the brain-specific nucleotide exchange factor kalirin-7 (Kal7) was identified as an MK5 interaction partner and substrate protein. In transfected primary neurons, Sept7-dependent dendrite development and spine formation are stimulated by the ERK3/MK5 module. Thus, the regulation of neuronal morphogenesis is proposed as the first physiological function of the ERK3/MK5 signaling module.

This qualitative focus-group study examined perspectives from students, parents and healthcare providers on CE. Stakeholders expressed ambivalence regarding CE (i.e. reactions to, definitions of, risks, and benefits). They were reluctant to adopt analogies to performance-enhancing steroids and caffeine though these analogies were useful in discussing concepts common to the use of different performance-enhancing substances. Media coverage of CE was criticized for lack of scientific rigor, ethical clarity, and inadvertent promotion of CE. Ambivalence of stakeholders suggests fundamental discomfort with economic and social driving forces of CE. Forms of public dialogue that voice the unease and ambivalence of stakeholders should be pursued to avoid opting hastily for permissive or restrictive health policies for CE.

In addition, expression of SRY/Sry outside the genital ridge has been reported, including preimplantation embryos, although the functional significance of this is not well understood. Results: Using Cre-mediated lineage studies and transgenic reporter mouse models, we now show that promoter sequences of human, pig and mouse SRY drive robust reporter gene expression in epiblast cells of peri-implantation embryos between embryonic day (E) 4.5 and E6.5. Analysis of endogenous Sry expression revealed that linear transcripts are produced by means of multiple polyadenylation sites in E4.5 embryos. Within the epiblast, SRY reporter expression mimics the expression seen using a Gata4 reporter model, but is dissimilar to that seen using an Oct4 reporter model. In addition, we report that overexpression of mouse Sry in embryonic stem cells leads to down-regulation of the core pluripotency markers Sox2 and Nanog. Conclusion: We propose that SRY/Sry may function as a male-specific maturation factor in the peri-implantation mammalian embryo, providing a genetic mechanism to help explain the observation that male embryos are developmentally more advanced compared with female embryos, and suggesting a role for SRY beyond that of TDF.

Enhanced visual functioning in autism: An ALE meta-analysis	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING			English	Review						hyperlexia; reading; fMRI; vision; perception; enhanced perceptual functioning model; expertise; plasticity	FUSIFORM FACE AREA; EVENT-RELATED FMRI; VENTROLATERAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; HUMAN EXTRASTRIATE CORTEX; FIGURES TASK-PERFORMANCE; PRIMATE FRONTAL-CORTEX; HUMAN NEURAL SYSTEM; SPECTRUM DISORDERS; WORKING-MEMORY	Autistics often exhibit enhanced perceptual abilities when engaged in visual search, visual discrimination, and embedded figure detection. In similar fashion, while performing a range of perceptual or cognitive tasks, autistics display stronger physiological engagement of the visual system than do non-autistics. To account for these findings, the Enhanced Perceptual Functioning Model proposes that enhanced autistic performance in basic perceptual tasks results from stronger engagement of sensory processing mechanisms, a situation that may facilitate an atypically prominent role for perceptual mechanisms in supporting cognition. Using quantitative meta-analysis of published functional imaging studies from which Activation Likelihood Estimation maps were computed, we asked whether autism is associated with enhanced task-related activity for a broad range of visual tasks. To determine whether atypical engagement of visual processing is a general or domain-specific phenomenon, we examined three different visual processing domains: faces, objects, and words. Overall, we observed more activity in autistics compared to non-autistics in temporal, occipital, and parietal regions. In contrast, autistics exhibited less activity in frontal cortex. The spatial distribution of the observed differential between-group patterns varied across processing domains. Autism may be characterized by enhanced functional resource allocation in regions associated with visual processing and expertise. Atypical adult organizational patterns may reflect underlying differences in developmental neural plasticity that can result in aspects of the autistic phenotype, including enhanced visual skills, atypical face processing, and hyperlexia.

Recognition of variable courtship song in the field cricket Gryllus assimilis	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY			English	Article						mating behavior; playback; stabilizing selection; auditory interneuron	FEMALE MATE CHOICE; CALLING-SONG; TELEOGRYLLUS-OCEANICUS; SEXUAL SELECTION; SOUND LOCALIZATION; ORTHOPTERA; GRYLLIDAE; NEURONS; COMMUNICATION; BIMACULATUS	We analyzed the courtship song of the field cricket Gryllus assimilis. The song comprises two elements: groups of ca. 10 pulses (chirps) with low fundamental frequency (3.5-3.7. kHz) alternating with high-frequency (15-17. kHz) pulses (ticks) that usually occur as doublets. Some elements of courtship song are quite variable (high coefficient of variation) both within and between males, whereas others are more stereotypical. In experiments with playback of synthesized courtship songs, we studied the importance of several song parameters for mating success, which we evaluated as the probability with which females mounted muted, courting males. Altering some features that show little variability, such as chirp-pulse rate or carrier frequency of ticks, resulted in significant decreases in mounting frequency, consistent with the notion that trait values showing little variability are constrained by stabilizing selection exerted by females. However, alteration of one invariant trait, the occurrence of both song components, by omitting either component from test songs only slightly affected female responsiveness. Alteration of a variable song trait, the number of ticks per song phrase, had no effect on female response rate, thus failing to provide support for the idea that variable traits provide a substrate for sexual selection. An unusual characteristic feature of the song of G. assimilis is that chirp pulses often contain substantial high-frequency power, and indeed may entirely lack power at the fundamental frequency. Playback experiments showed that such songs are, nevertheless, behaviorally effective. To understand the neural basis for this, we recorded the responses of the two principal ascending auditory interneurons of crickets, AN1 and AN2. Our results suggest that the frequency selectivity of the neurons is sufficiently broad to tolerate the spectral variability of courtship chirps.

Neurochem. (2012) 122, 147161. Abstract The mechanisms that regulate synapse formation and maintenance are incompletely understood. In particular, relatively few inhibitors of synapse formation have been identified. Receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase s (RPTPs), a transmembrane tyrosine phosphatase, is widely expressed by neurons in developing and mature mammalian brain, and functions as a receptor for chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans that inhibits axon regeneration following injury. In this study, we address RPTPs function in the mature brain. We demonstrate increased axon collateral branching in the hippocampus of RPTPs null mice during normal aging or following chemically induced seizure, indicating that RPTPs maintains neural circuitry by inhibiting axonal branching. Previous studies demonstrated a role for pre-synaptic RPTPs promoting synaptic differentiation during development; however, subcellular fractionation revealed enrichment of RPTPs in post-synaptic densities. We report that neurons lacking RPTPs have an increased density of pre-synaptic varicosities in vitro and increased dendritic spine density and length in vivo. RPTPs knockouts exhibit an increased frequency of miniature excitatory post-synaptic currents, and greater paired-pulse facilitation, consistent with increased synapse density but reduced synaptic efficiency. Furthermore, RPTPs nulls exhibit reduced long-term potentiation and enhanced novel object recognition memory. We conclude that RPTPs limits synapse number and regulates synapse structure and function in the mature CNS.

AMPA/kainate receptors in the ventromedial hypothalamus mediate the effects of glutamate on estrus termination in the rat	PHARMACOLOGY BIOCHEMISTRY AND BEHAVIOR			English	Article						Glutamate; Sexual behavior; Female; VMH; Vaginocervical stimulation	CONSUMMATORY SEXUAL-BEHAVIORS; PACED COITAL STIMULATION; FEMALE RAT; VAGINOCERVICAL STIMULATION; COPULATORY-BEHAVIOR; BILEVEL CHAMBERS; PREOPTIC AREA; FOS; FOREBRAIN; NEURONS	Infusions of glutamate or its selective receptor agonists to the VMH of ovariectomized (OVX) female rats primed with estradiol benzoate (EB) and progesterone (P) inhibit both appetitive and consummatory aspects of sexual behavior whereas selective glutamate receptor antagonists facilitate these measures in females primed with EB alone. Because vaginocervical stimulation (VCS) activates glutamate neurons in the VMH, and induces a faster termination of estros behavior, the present study examined the effects of the AMPA/kainate receptor antagonist DNQX on the induction of estrus termination by manual VCS. Ovx, sexually-experienced rats were primed with EB and P and subsequently received either 1 or 50 distributed VCSs, over the course of an hour, 12 h before a test with sexually vigorous males. Half of the females in each stimulus group received bilateral infusions of 1 mu l/side of either DNQX (19.8 mmol/mu l) or saline aimed at the VMH immediately prior to VCS or sham stimulation. Saline-infused females given VCS had lower lordosis quotients compared to females given sham stimulation. In contrast, females infused with DNQX prior to VCS displayed more appetitive behaviors and higher lordosis quotients and magnitudes compared to females infused with saline. These data indicate that activation of AMPA/kainate receptors in the VMH by increased glutamate transmission induced by VCS mediates estrus termination. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Increased activity of mesolimbic dopamine (DA) neurons, a hallmark of psychosis, is found in offspring of rodents exposed to a prenatal inflammatory challenge but it is unclear how this effect is elicited. Using an experimental model of localized aseptic inflammation with turpentine oil (TURP) we sought to establish whether circulating interleukin-6 (IL-6) and leptin play a role in the effects of prenatal inflammation on DA neurons. Both mediators are involved in the systemic inflammatory response to immunogens, with IL-6 mediating the early phase, followed by leptin in the late phase of the response. Maternal treatment with TURP at gestational day (GD) 15 enhanced the locomotor response to the DA indirect agonist, amphetamine (AMPH), increased the expression of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), an enzyme involved in DA synthesis, DA levels and the expression of the post-synaptic protein spinophilin in the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) in the adult offspring. All of these alterations were totally abolished by co-treating the pregnant dams with a neutralizing IL-6 antiserum. Neutralization of maternal leptin prevented the enhanced behavioral sensitization and elevation of DA and spinophilin in the NAcc but spared other changes regulated by IL-6, such as increased NAcc TH levels and acute locomotor response to AMPH. Our results provide novel evidence to suggest that prenatal surges in both maternal circulating IL-6 and leptin contribute to the appearance of sensitized DA function in the adult offspring.

Antibodies directed against the aquaporin-4 water channel has led to recognition of neuromyelitis optica (NMO) and NMO spectrum disorders in both children and adults and to the ability to predict a relapsing disease course in antibody-positive patients. Serum antibodies directed against myelin antigens are detectable in approximately one third of children with acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) at the time of acute illness, and in approximately 25% of children with multiple sclerosis (MS) in whom seropositivity persists. Whether circulating antibodies contribute to disease pathogenesis or are secondary to cell damage is an area of active study. The contribution of T-cells, eosinophils, neutrophils, infection and blood brain barrier permeability are also receiving increasing attention in antibody-associated inflammatory demyelination. The present manuscript reviews the current clinical, laboratory and immunological features of acquired CNS inflammation in children. (C) 2012 Elsevier BY. All rights reserved.

While amyloid plaque-associated inflammation has been extensively studied in human and animal models, little is known about the inflammatory process prior to plaque deposition, i.e., in preclinical stages of AD. In this study we investigated microglial and neuronal inflammatory markers in preplaque transgenic McGill-Thy1-APP mice. We found evidence that prior to plaque deposition classical markers of microglial activation such as major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC-II), inducible nitric oxide synthase (i-NOS), and CD40 are already upregulated in the hippocampus of transgenic mice. Microglial cells from transgenic mice in the preplaque stage displayed intermediately activated morphology and appeared to be recruited toward intracellular amyloid-beta peptide (A beta)-oligomer burdened neurons. The inducible, neuron-specific cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) enzyme was found to be upregulated and specifically expressed by neurons in close relationship with A beta-bearing cells, at this early stage of the AD-like pathology. Our study suggests that neuroinflammation might be one of the earliest pathological responses to intracellular accumulation of A beta-oligomers. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

In this study, we used behaviorally characterized rats to correlate age-related morphological changes with cognitive impairment. For this, young and aged animals were tested in the Morris water maze to evaluate their cognitive performance. Following behavioral characterization, the animals were perfused and a combination of intracellular labeling and immunohistochemistry was applied. Using this approach, we characterized the dendritic morphology of cortical pyramidal neurons as well as the pattern of glutamatergic and GABAergic appositions on their cell bodies and dendrites. We focused on the association region of the parietal cortex (LtPA) and the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) for their involvement in the Morris water maze task. We found an age-related atrophy of distal basal dendrites that did not differ between aged cognitively unimpaired (AU) and aged cognitively impaired animals (AI). Dendritic spines and glutamatergic appositions generally decreased from young to AU and from AU to AI rats. On the other hand, GABAergic appositions only showed a trend towards a decrease in AU rats. Collectively, the data show that the ratio of excitatory/inhibitory inputs was only altered in AI animals. When cortical cholinergic varicosities were labeled on alternate sections, we found that AI animals also had a significant reduction of cortical cholinergic boutons compared with AU or young animals. In aged animals, the density of cortical cholinergic varicosities correlated with the excitatory/inhibitory ratio. Our data suggest that both cholinergic atrophy and an imbalance towards inhibition may contribute to the observed age-associated behavioral impairment. (C) 2012 IBRO All rights reserved.

Surprisingly, no study has yet addressed this problem with second-generation antipsychotics. The objective of this study was to determine the extent to which risperidone at low doses altered balance control in healthy participants. Twelve healthy young adults received, following a randomized double-blind crossover design, a single oral dose of placebo, 1 and 3 mg of risperidone on separate days at least 14 days apart. Evaluation of extrapyramidal symptoms using the Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale-abbreviated scoring form (ESRS-A) and measures of postural sway using a force platform were assessed over 9 h following drug ingestion. There is a significant increase in the postural stability item of the ESRS-A parkinsonism subscale at 3 and 6 h following 3 mg of risperidone only when compared to placebo. With regard to balance control, body sway measures were increased at 1 mg of risperidone but more pronounced at 3 mg. The peak effects were observed at 3 h after administration of the drug and had not completely returned to baseline after 9 h. Risperidone administered at low doses did not elicit clinically detectable EPS but had significant effects on balance control. A dose-response effect on impairment of balance was observed that followed the expected time course of the drug pharmacokinetics. These results are likely to apply to older or demented individuals who have pre-existing balance control deficit.

Previous research on oxytocin and stress has focused on achievement-related stressors among male participants. The aims of the study were to (1) examine the influence of oxytocin on the affective and cortisol response to the Yale Interpersonal Stressor (YIPS), a live social rejection paradigm, and (2) to replicate the finding that women exhibit a greater cortisol response to interpersonal stress than men (Stroud et al. 2002). Sex differences in stress responses: Social rejection versus achievement stress. Biol Psychiat 53: 318-327. Ninety-six undergraduate students underwent the YIPS, where participants were excluded from two separate conversations by two same-sex confederates. Salivary cortisol concentrations and mood were repeatedly measured throughout the study. Participants were administered, in a double-blind design, a single dose of intranasal oxytocin (24 IU) or placebo prior to beginning the YIPS. The YIPS elicited a significant negative mood response that was more pronounced in females than in males. However, no significant cortisol response to the stressor and no sex difference in cortisol reactivity were observed. A significant effect of drug condition on cortisol levels was observed. Participants who were administered oxytocin exhibited a decrease in cortisol levels, relative to placebo, during the YIPS, F (4, 184) 4.50, p < 0.05. The study failed to replicate the sex difference in the cortisol response to interpersonal stress reported by Stroud et al. (2002). Intranasal oxytocin, however, appeared to reduce cortisol concentrations during an interpersonal challenge.

Methods: Ten young (23.49 +/- 4.72) and ten older adults (age 76.22 +/- 3.11) were asked to physically walk straight while viewing a virtual scene in a head-mounted display (HMD) unit under three conditions: no visual perturbation, blank (no visual input), and visual perturbation. Subjects performed the tasks walking at two speeds: preferred self-pace and fast. Variables calculated included trajectory, heading angle, and body segment orientations. Results: In the perturbation condition, the older adults walked with higher segmentation and more deviations of the body's centre of mass. Only the young subjects were affected by the walking speed, with an improved performance when walking fast. Conclusions: Old age affects the ability to re-weight visual information and make postural or locomotor adjustments in real time. The lower errors of the young adults in the fast conditions suggest decreased cortical control of locomotion with increasing speeds. Significance: Visual information presented in real time can impact on balance and mobility in older adults, and thus should be given serious consideration for the purpose of evaluation and intervention.

Comparison of transfer functions in statistical downscaling models for daily temperature and precipitation over Canada	STOCHASTIC ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND RISK ASSESSMENT			English	Article						Artificial neural network; Climate change; Statistical downscaling; Precipitation; Temperature; Transfer function; Multiple linear regression	ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; CLIMATE-CHANGE SCENARIOS; UNCERTAINTY ANALYSIS; MUTUAL INFORMATION; NORTHERN CANADA; SIMULATION; REGRESSION; RAINFALL; CIRCULATION; PERFORMANCE	This study compares three linear models and one non-linear model, specifically multiple linear regression (MLR) with ordinary least squares (OLS) estimates, robust regression, ridge regression, and artificial neural networks (ANNs), to identify an appropriate transfer function in statistical downscaling (SD) models for the daily maximum and minimum temperatures (T-max and T-min) and daily precipitation occurrence and amounts (P-occ and P-amount). This comparison was made over twenty-five observation sites located in five different Canadian provinces (British Columbia, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario, and Qu,bec). Reanalysis data were employed as atmospheric predictor variables of SD models. Predictors of linear transfer functions and ANN were selected by linear correlations coefficient and mutual information, respectively. For each downscaled case, annual and monthly models were developed and analysed. The monthly MLR, annual ANN, annual ANN, and annual MLR yielded the best performance for T-max, T-min, P-occ and P-amont according to the modified Akaike information criterion (AICu). A monthly MLR is recommended for the transfer functions of the four predictands because it can provide a better performance for the T-max and as good performance as the annual MLR for the T-min, P-occ, and P-amount. Furthermore, a monthly MLR can provide a slightly better performance than an annual MLR for extreme events. An annual MLR approach is also equivalently recommended for the transfer functions of the four predictands because it showed as good a performance as monthly MLR in spite of its mathematical simplicity. Robust and ridge regressions are not recommended because the data used in this study are not greatly affected by outlier data and multicollinearity problems. An annual ANN is recommended only for the T-min, based on the best performance among the models in terms of both the RMSE and AICu.	[Jeong, D. I.; St-Hilaire, A.; Ouarda, T. B. M.

Here, we used p38 pharmacological inhibitors and gene silencing to assess their effects on downstream kinases and key transcription factors. We show that p38a regulates expression of the master transcription factor, Krox-20, required for the onset of myelination in Schwann cell-DRGNs, as assessed by immunocytochemistry and qRT-PCR. p38 activity is also required for the expression of the cell cycle inhibitor p27kip1, associated with Schwann cell differentiation. Three potential effectors of p38 were explored: MAPK-activated protein kinase-2 (MK2), mitogen and stress-activated protein kinase-1 (MSK-1), and the transcription factor cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB). Inhibition of MK2 with CMPD1 or gene knockdown with siRNAs reduced numbers of Krox-20-positive Schwann cells and expression of myelin proteins MBP and MAG. ECM activated CREB and increased Krox-20 expression, whereas CREB1 gene silencing reduced Krox-20. Furthermore, two nonselective inhibitors of MSK-1 (H89 and R0-318820) decreased ECM-induced CREB phosphorylation and, similar to anti-MSK-1 siRNAs, reduced Krox-20-positive cells. In addition, p38 modulated the expression of two transcription factors involved in the regulation of Krox-20 [suppressed cAMP-inducible protein (SCIP) and Sox10], but not Sox2, an antagonist of Krox-20. Collectively, our results show that p38 primarily directs Schwann cell differentiation and peripheral myelination by regulating Krox-20 expression through its downstream effectors, MK2 and MSK-1/CREB, and transcription factors SCIP and Sox10.

EAE pathogenesis involves various cell types, cytokines, chemokines, and adhesion molecules. Given the complexity of the inflammatory response in EAE, it is likely that many immune mediators still remain to be discovered. To identify novel immune mediators of EAE pathogenesis, we performed an Affymetrix gene array screen on the spinal cords of mice at the onset stage of disease. This screening identified the gene encoding lipocalin 2 (Lcn2) as being significantly upregulated. Lcn2 is a multi-functional protein that plays a role in glial activation, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) stabilization, and cellular iron flux. As many of these processes have been implicated in EAE, we characterized the expression and role of Lcn2 in this disease in C57BL/6 mice. We show that Lcn2 is significantly upregulated in the spinal cord throughout EAE and is expressed predominantly by monocytes and reactive astrocytes. The Lcn2 receptor, 24p3R, is also expressed on monocytes, macrophages/microglia, and astrocytes in EAE. In addition, we show that EAE severity is increased in Lcn2-/- mice as compared with wild-type controls. Finally, we demonstrate that elevated levels of Lcn2 are detected in the plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in MS and in immune cells in CNS lesions in MS tissue sections. These data indicate that Lcn2 is a modulator of EAE pathogenesis and suggest that it may also play a role in MS. (C) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Redistribution of monocarboxylate transporter 2 on the surface of astrocytes in the human epileptogenic hippocampus	GLIA			English	Article						blood-brain barrier; astrocyte endfoot; hippocampal sclerosis; ketone bodies; ketongenic diet	TEMPORAL-LOBE EPILEPSY; ADULT-MOUSE BRAIN; ACID TRANSPORTERS; GLUTAMATE UPTAKE; KETOGENIC DIET; RAT-BRAIN; IN-VITRO; MCT2; EXPRESSION; CORTEX	Emerging evidence points to monocarboxylates as key players in the pathophysiology of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) with hippocampal sclerosis (mesial temporal lobe epilepsy, MTLE). Monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs) 1 and 2, which are abundantly present on brain endothelial cells and perivascular astrocyte endfeet, respectively, facilitate the transport of monocarboxylates and protons across cell membranes. Recently, we reported that the density of MCT1 protein is reduced on endothelial cells and increased on astrocyte plasma membranes in the hippocampal formation in patients with MTLE and in several animal models of the disorder. Because the perivascular astrocyte endfeet comprise an important part of the neurovascular unit, we now assessed the distribution of the MCT2 in hippocampal formations in TLE patients with (MTLE) or without hippocampal sclerosis (non-MTLE). Light microscopic immunohistochemistry revealed significantly less perivascular MCT2 immunoreactivity in the hippocampal formation in MTLE (n = 6) than in non-MTLE (n = 6) patients, and to a lesser degree in non-MTLE than in nonepilepsy patients (n = 4). Immunogold electron microscopy indicated that the loss of MCT2 protein occurred on perivascular astrocyte endfeet. Interestingly, the loss of MCT2 on astrocyte endfeet in MTLE (n = 3) was accompanied by an upregulation of the protein on astrocyte membranes facing synapses in the neuropil, when compared with non-MTLE (n = 3). We propose that the altered distribution of MCT1 and MCT2 in TLE (especially MTLE) limits the flux of monocarboxylates across the bloodbrain barrier and enhances the exchange of monocarboxylates within the brain parenchyma.

In an increasingly health-centered society, these applications constitute a burgeoning commercial market. Sparse evidence coupled with lack of scientific rigor, however, leaves claims concerning the impact and duration of such brain training largely unsubstantiated. On the other hand, at least some scientific findings seem to support the effectiveness and sustainability of training for higher brain functions such as attention and working memory. In the present paper we provide a tectonic integration and synthesis of cognitive training approaches. Specifically, we sketch the relative merits and shortcomings of these programs, which often appeal to parents who must choose between side-effect-laden medication and other less conventional options. Here we examine how neuroplasticity allows the healthy as well the impaired to benefit from cognitive training programs. We evaluate the evidence and consider whether brain training can be a stand-alone treatment or an adjunct to pharmacotherapy, outline promising future prospects, and highlight what training outcomes are plausible in line with available data. Future research would determine whether the field of brain training realizes its potential to revolutionize education and rehabilitation or withers away engulfed in controversy.

Since new reference data often becomes available during operations, performance could be maintained or improved by adapting these systems through supervised incremental learning. To avoid knowledge corruption and sustain a high level of accuracy over time, an adaptive multiclassifier system (AMCS) may integrate information from diverse classifiers that are guided by a population-based evolutionary optimization algorithm. In this paper, an incremental learning strategy based on dynamic particle swarm optimization (DPSO) is proposed to evolve heterogeneous ensembles of classifiers (where each classifier corresponds to a particle) in response to new reference samples. This new strategy is applied to video-based face recognition, using an AMCS that consists of a pool of fuzzy ARTMAP (FAM) neural networks for classification of facial regions, and a niching version of DPSO that optimizes all FAM parameters such that the classification rate is maximized. Given that diversity within a dynamic particle swarm is correlated with diversity within a corresponding pool of base classifiers, DPSO properties are exploited to generate and evolve diversified pools of FAM classifiers, and to efficiently select ensembles among the pools based on accuracy and particle swarm diversity. Performance of the proposed strategy is assessed in terms of classification rate and resource requirements under different incremental learning scenarios, where new reference data is extracted from real-world video streams. Simulation results indicate the DPSO strategy provides an efficient way to evolve ensembles of FAM networks in an AMCS. Maintaining particle diversity in the optimization space yields a level of accuracy that is comparable to AMCS using reference ensemble-based and batch learning techniques, but requires significantly lower computational complexity than assessing diversity among classifiers in the feature or decision spaces.

Generation of microisland cultures using microcontact printing to pattern protein substrates	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Microfabrication; Cell patterning; Co-culture; Cell-cell interactions; Island patterning; Netrin-1; Neuronal network	RAT SYMPATHETIC NEURONS; DOPAMINERGIC-NEURONS; POSTNATAL RAT; MICROCULTURES; GUIDANCE	The capacity to isolate small numbers of neurons in vitro is an essential tool to study the cell biology of synapses and the development of neuronal networks by specific cell types. Microisland culture assays allow for single neurons, or simple neural networks, to be isolated on islands of glial cells; however, the techniques commonly used to produce microisland substrates are expensive, challenging to control, and typically result in many discarded substrates. Here, we used microcontact printing to pattern a glass surface with islands of extracellular matrix proteins known to support neural cell growth and differentiation. To promote segregation of the cells to the islands, the substrate surrounding the islands was backfilled with polyethylene glycol (PEG), forming a relatively non-permissive surface on which cell attachment is limited. Astrocytes, and subsequently hippocampal neurons, were then seeded onto the islands of patterned protein. Using this method, readily reproducible patterns of protein islands were produced that permit cell attachment, differentiation, and growth. The technique is a rapid, inexpensive, and reliable means to generate patterned substrates appropriate for microisland cultures. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

First, the short lifespan of rats and mice, as well as the ability to have homogenous genetics and environments, allows for longitudinal studies of the effects of chronic pain on the brain. Second, brain imaging in animals allows for the testing of central actions of novel pharmacological and nonpharmacological analgesics before they can be tested in humans. The two most commonly used brain imaging methods in rodents are magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET). MRI provides better spatial and temporal resolution than PET, but PET allows for the imaging of neurotransmitters and non-neuronal cells, such as astrocytes, in addition to functional imaging. One problem with rodent brain imaging involves methods for keeping the subject still in the scanner. Both anesthetic agents and restraint techniques have potential confounds. Some PET methods allow for tracer uptake before the animal is anesthetized, but imaging a moving animal also has potential confounds. Despite the challenges associated with the various techniques, the 31 studies using either functional MRI or PET to image pain processing in rodents have yielded surprisingly consistent results, with brain regions commonly activated in human pain imaging studies (somatosensory cortex, cingulate cortex, thalamus) also being activated in the majority of these studies. Pharmacological imaging in rodents shows overlapping activation patterns with pain and opiate analgesics, similar to what is found in humans. Despite the many structural imaging studies in human chronic pain patients, only one study has been performed in rodents, but that study confirmed human findings of decreased cortical thickness associated with chronic pain. Future directions in rodent pain imaging include miniaturized PET for the freely moving animal, as well as new MRI techniques that enable ongoing chronic pain imaging. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

J	Becker, S; Gandhi, W; Schweinhardt, P				Becker, Susanne; Gandhi, Wiebke; Schweinhardt, Petra			Cerebral interactions of pain and reward and their relevance for chronic pain	NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS			English	Review						Pain-reward interaction; Dopamine; Opioids; Pain relief; Orbitofrontal cortex; Ventral striatum	OPIOID RECEPTOR AVAILABILITY; HUMAN ORBITOFRONTAL CORTEX; MEDIAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; DECISION-MAKING TASK; NUCLEUS-ACCUMBENS; INCENTIVE SALIENCE; DOPAMINE TRANSMISSION; FIBROMYALGIA PATIENTS; EFFERENT PROJECTIONS; INDUCED ANALGESIA	Pain and reward are opponent, interacting processes. Such interactions are enabled by neuroanatomical and neurochemical overlaps of brain systems that process pain and reward. Cerebral processing of hedonic ('liking') and motivational ('wanting') aspects of reward can be separated: the orbitofrontal cortex and opioids play an important role for the hedonic experience, and the ventral striatum and dopamine predominantly process motivation for reward. Supported by neuroimaging studies, we present here the hypothesis that the orbitofrontal cortex and opioids are responsible for pain modulation by hedonic experience, while the ventral striatum and dopamine mediate motivational effects on pain. A rewarding stimulus that appears to be particularly important in the context of pain is pain relief. Further, reward, including pain relief, leads to operant learning, which can affect pain sensitivity. Indirect evidence points at brain mechanisms that might underlie pain relief as a reward and related operant learning but studies are scarce.

Bursts and Isolated Spikes Code for Opposite Movement Directions in Midbrain Electrosensory Neurons	PLOS ONE			English	Article							WEAKLY ELECTRIC FISH; LATERAL GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; THALAMOCORTICAL RELAY NEURONS; PRIMARY VISUAL-CORTEX; IN-VIVO; ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL PROPERTIES; COMMUNICATION SIGNALS; APTERONOTUS-ALBIFRONS; STIMULUS SELECTIVITY; SYNAPTIC DYNAMICS	Directional selectivity, in which neurons respond strongly to an object moving in a given direction but weakly or not at all to the same object moving in the opposite direction, is a crucial computation that is thought to provide a neural correlate of motion perception. However, directional selectivity has been traditionally quantified by using the full spike train, which does not take into account particular action potential patterns. We investigated how different action potential patterns, namely bursts (i.e. packets of action potentials followed by quiescence) and isolated spikes, contribute to movement direction coding in a mathematical model of midbrain electrosensory neurons. We found that bursts and isolated spikes could be selectively elicited when the same object moved in opposite directions. In particular, it was possible to find parameter values for which our model neuron did not display directional selectivity when the full spike train was considered but displayed strong directional selectivity when bursts or isolated spikes were instead considered. Further analysis of our model revealed that an intrinsic burst mechanism based on subthreshold T-type calcium channels was not required to observe parameter regimes for which bursts and isolated spikes code for opposite movement directions. However, this burst mechanism enhanced the range of parameter values for which such regimes were observed. Experimental recordings from midbrain neurons confirmed our modeling prediction that bursts and isolated spikes can indeed code for opposite movement directions. Finally, we quantified the performance of a plausible neural circuit and found that it could respond more or less selectively to isolated spikes for a wide range of parameter values when compared with an interspike interval threshold. Our results thus show for the first time that different action potential patterns can differentially encode movement and that traditional measures of directional selectivity need to be revised in such cases.

Indirect Effects of Wnt3a/beta-Catenin Signalling Support Mouse Spermatogonial Stem Cells In Vitro	PLOS ONE			English	Article							SELF-RENEWAL; STEM/PROGENITOR CELLS; BETA-CATENIN; EXPRESSION; SPERMATOGENESIS; ACTIVATION; PATHWAY; EMBRYOS; NOTCH; ASSAY	Proper regulation of spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) is crucial for sustaining steady-state spermatogenesis. Previous work has identified several paracrine factors involved in this regulation, in particular, glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor and fibroblast growth factor 2, which promote long-term SSC self-renewal. Using a SSC culture system, we have recently reported that Wnt5a promotes SSC self-renewal through a beta-catenin-independent Wnt mechanism whereas the beta-catenin-dependent Wnt pathway is not active in SSCs. In contrast, another study has reported that Wnt3a promotes SSC self-renewal through the beta-catenin-dependent pathway, as it can stimulate the proliferation of a spermatogonia cell line. To reconcile these two contradictory reports, we assessed Wnt3a effects on SSCs and progenitor cells, rather than a cell line, in vitro. We observed that Wnt3a induced beta-catenin-dependent signalling in a large subset of germ cells and increased SSC numbers. However, further investigation revealed that cell populations with greater beta-catenin-signalling activity contained fewer SSCs. The increased maintenance of SSCs by Wnt3a coincided with more active cell cycling and the formation of germ cell aggregates, or communities, under feeder-free conditions. Therefore, the results of this study suggest that Wnt3a selectively stimulates proliferation of progenitors that are committed to differentiation or are in the process of exiting the SSC state, leading to enhanced formation of germ cell communities, which indirectly support SSCs and act as an in vitro niche.

Substantial evidence indicates that alterations in APP trafficking within the secretory and endocytic pathways directly impact the interaction of APP with these secretases and subsequent A beta production. Various members of the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) family have been reported to play a role in APP trafficking and processing and are important risk factors in AD. We recently characterized a distinct member of the LDLR family called LDLR-related protein 10 (LRP10) that shuttles between the trans-Golgi Network (TGN), plasma membrane (PM), and endosomes. Here we investigated whether LRP10 participates in APP intracellular trafficking and A beta production. Results: In this report, we provide evidence that LRP10 is a functional APP receptor involved in APP trafficking and processing. LRP10 interacts directly with the ectodomain of APP and colocalizes with APP at the TGN. Increased expression of LRP10 in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells induces the accumulation of mature APP in the Golgi and reduces its presence at the cell surface and its processing into A beta, while knockdown of LRP10 expression increases A beta production. Mutations of key motifs responsible for the recycling of LRP10 to the TGN results in the aberrant redistribution of APP with LRP10 to early endosomes and a concomitant increase in APP beta-cleavage into A beta. Furthermore, expression of LRP10 is significantly lower in the post-mortem brain tissues of AD patients, supporting a possible role for LRP10 in AD. Conclusions: The present study identified LRP10 as a novel APP sorting receptor that protects APP from amyloidogenic processing, suggesting that a decrease in LRP10 function may contribute to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.

Previous studies indicate that downregulation of TrkB-T1 in frontal cortex may be involved in neurobiological processes underlying suicide. Methods: In a microarray screening study (N = 8), we interrogated all known microRNA in the frontal cortex of suicide completers with low expression of TrkB-T1 and normal controls. These findings were validated and followed up in a larger sample of cases and controls (N = 55). Functional analyses included microRNA silencing, microRNA overexpression and luciferase assays to investigate specificity and to validate interactions between differentially expressed microRNA and TrkB-T1. Results: MicroRNAs Hsa-miR-185* and Hsa-miR-491-3p were upregulated in suicide completers with low expression of TrkB.T1 (P-nominal: 9.10(-5) and 1.8.10(-4) respectively; FDR-corrected p = 0.031). Bioinformatic analyses revealed five putative binding sites for the DiGeorge syndrome linked microRNA Hsa-miR-185* in the 3'UTR of TrkB-T1, but none for Hsa-miR-491-3P. The increase of Hsa-miR-185* in frontal cortex of suicide completers was validated then confirmed in a larger, randomly selected group of suicide completers, where an inverse correlation between Hsa-miR-185* and TrkB-T1 expression was observed (R = -0.439; p = 0.001). Silencing and overexpression studies performed in human cell lines confirmed the inverse relationship between hsa-mir-185* and trkB-T1 expression. Luciferase assays demonstrated that Hsa-miR-185* binds to sequences in the 39UTR of TrkB-T1. Conclusion: These results suggest that an increase of Hsa-miR-185* expression levels regulates, at least in part, the TrkB-T1 decrease observed in the frontal cortex of suicide completers and further implicate the 22q11 region in psychopathology.

Cannabis-Dependence Risk Relates to Synergism between Neuroticism and Proenkephalin SNPs Associated with Amygdala Gene Expression: Case-Control Study	PLOS ONE			English	Article							POPULATION-BASED SAMPLE; STOP SIGNAL INHIBITION; D2 RECEPTOR GENE; ENVIRONMENTAL-INFLUENCES; PRE-PROENKEPHALIN; NEGATIVE AFFECT; WORKING-MEMORY; SUBSTANCE USE; FEMALE TWINS; DRUG-USE	Background: Many young people experiment with cannabis, yet only a subgroup progress to dependence suggesting individual differences that could relate to factors such as genetics and behavioral traits. Dopamine receptor D2 (DRD2) and proenkephalin (PENK) genes have been implicated in animal studies with cannabis exposure. Whether polymorphisms of these genes are associated with cannabis dependence and related behavioral traits is unknown. Methodology/Principal Findings: Healthy young adults (18-27 years) with cannabis dependence and without a dependence diagnosis were studied (N = 50/group) in relation to a priori-determined single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the DRD2 and PENK genes. Negative affect, Impulsive Risk Taking and Neuroticism-Anxiety temperamental traits, positive and negative reward-learning performance and stop-signal reaction times were examined. The findings replicated the known association between the rs6277 DRD2 SNP and decisions associated with negative reinforcement outcomes. Moreover, PENK variants (rs2576573 and rs2609997) significantly related to Neuroticism and cannabis dependence. Cigarette smoking is common in cannabis users, but it was not associated to PENK SNPs as also validated in another cohort (N = 247 smokers, N = 312 non-smokers). Neuroticism mediated (15.3%-19.5%) the genetic risk to cannabis dependence and interacted with risk SNPs, resulting in a 9-fold increase risk for cannabis dependence. Molecular characterization of the postmortem human brain in a different population revealed an association between PENK SNPs and PENK mRNA expression in the central amygdala nucleus emphasizing the functional relevance of the SNPs in a brain region strongly linked to negative affect. Conclusions/Significance: Overall, the findings suggest an important role for Neuroticism as an endophenotype linking PENK polymorphisms to cannabis-dependence vulnerability synergistically amplifying the apparent genetic risk.

Recently however, this network has been shown to be activated by certain types of tasks. Social cognition, particularly higher-order tasks such as attributing mental states to others, has been suggested to activate a network of areas at least partly overlapping with the DMN. Here, we explore this claim, drawing on evidence from meta-analyses of functional MRI data and recent studies investigating the structural and functional connectivity of the social brain. In addition, we discuss recent evidence for the existence of a DMN in non-human primates. We conclude by discussing some of the implications of these observations.

Resilience to stress may differ according to adiposity. Early studies that addressed this are difficult to interpret due to conflicting findings and limited methods. Recent advances in assessment of cardiovascular stress responses and of fat distribution allow accurate assessment of associations between adiposity and stress responsiveness. We measured responses to the Montreal Imaging Stress Task in healthy men (N = 43) and women (N = 45) with a wide range of BMIs. Heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP) measures were used with novel magnetic resonance measures of stroke volume (SV), cardiac output (CO), total peripheral resistance (TPR) and arterial compliance to assess cardiovascular responses. Salivary cortisol and the number and speed of answers to mathematics problems in the task were used to assess neuroendocrine and cognitive responses, respectively. Visceral and subcutaneous fat was measured using T-2*-IDEAL. Greater BMI was associated with generalised blunting of cardiovascular (HR:beta = -0.50 bpm.unit(-1), P = 0.009; SV:beta = -0.33 mL.unit(-1), P = 0.01; CO:beta = -61 mL.min(-1).unit(-1), P = 0.002; systolic BP:beta = -0.41 mmHg.unit(-1), P = 0.01; TPR: beta = 0.11 WU.unit(-1), P = 0.02), cognitive (correct answers: r = -0.28, P = 0.01; time to answer: r = 0.26, P = 0.02) and endocrine responses (cortisol: r = 20.25, P = 0.04) to stress. These associations were largely determined by visceral adiposity except for those related to cognitive performance, which were determined by both visceral and subcutaneous adiposity. Our findings suggest that adiposity is associated with centrally reduced stress responsiveness. Although this may mitigate some long-term health risks of stress responsiveness, reduced performance under stress may be a more immediate negative consequence.

We have reported that depression is frequent in mastocytosis, but although it was already described, little is known about the prevalence and features of cognitive impairment. Our objective was to describe the prevalence and features of cognitive impairment in a large cohort of patients with this rare disease (n = 57; mean age = 45) and to explore the relations between memory impairment and depression. Objective memory impairment was evaluated using the 3rd edition of the Clinical Memory scale of Wechsler. Depression symptoms were evaluated using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. Age and education levels were controlled for all patients. Patients with mastocytosis presented high levels of cognitive impairment (memory and/or attention) (n = 22; 38.6%). Cognitive impairment was moderate in 59% of the cases, concerned immediate auditory (41%) and working memory (73%) and was not associated to depression (p >= 0.717). In conclusion, immediate auditory memory and attention impairment in mastocytosis are frequent, even in young individuals, and are not consecutive to depression. In mastocytosis, cognitive complaints call for complex neuropsychological assessment. Mild-moderate cognitive impairment and depression constitute two specific but somewhat independent syndromes in mastocytosis. These results suggest differential effects of mast-cell activity in the brain, on systems involved in emotionality and in cognition.

Using positron emission tomography (PET) measures of brain serotonin (5-HT) synthesis, we found in a longitudinal sample that adult males with high childhood-limited aggression (C-LHPA) had lower in vivo 5-HT synthesis in the orbitofrontal cortex (OBFC). Here we hypothesized that 5-HT alterations associated with childhood aggression were linked to differential DNA methylation of critical genes in the 5-HT pathway and these changes were also detectable in peripheral white blood cells. Using pyrosequencing, we determined the state of DNA methylation of SLC6A4 promoter in T cells and monocytes isolated from blood of cohort members (N = 25) who underwent a PET scan, and we examined whether methylation status in the blood is associated with in vivo brain 5-HT synthesis. Higher levels of methylation were observed in both T cells and monocytes at specific CpG sites in the C-LHPA group. DNA methylation of SLC6A4 in monocytes appears to be associated more reliably with group membership than T cells. In both cell types the methylation state of these CpGs was associated with lower in vivo measures of brain 5-HT synthesis in the left and right lateral OBFC (N = 20) where lower 5-HT synthesis in C-LHPA group was observed. Furthermore, in vitro methylation of the SLC6A4 promoter in a luciferase reporter construct suppresses its transcriptional activity supporting a functional role of DNA methylation in SLC6A4 promoter regulation. These findings indicate that state of SLC6A4 promoter methylation is altered in peripheral white blood cells of individuals with physical aggression during childhood. This supports the relevance of peripheral DNA methylation for brain function and suggests that peripheral SLC6A4 DNA methylation could be a marker of central 5-HT function.

The aim of the present study was to explore the effects of selective REM sleep deprivation (REM-D) on emotional responses to threatening visual stimuli and their brain correlates using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Twenty healthy subjects were randomly assigned to two groups: selective REM-D, by awakening them at each REM sleep onset, or non-rapid eye movement sleep interruptions (NREM-I) as control for potential non-specific effects of awakenings and lack of sleep. In a within-subject design, a visual emotional reactivity task was performed in the scanner before and 24 h after sleep manipulation. Behaviorally, emotional reactivity was enhanced relative to baseline (BL) in the REM deprived group only. In terms of fMRI signal, there was, as expected, an overall decrease in activity in the NREM-I group when subjects performed the task the second time, particularly in regions involved in emotional processing, such as occipital and temporal areas, as well as in the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, involved in top-down emotion regulation. In contrast, activity in these areas remained the same level or even increased in the REM-D group, compared to their BL level. Taken together, these results suggest that lack of REM sleep in humans is associated with enhanced emotional reactivity, both at behavioral and neural levels, and thus highlight the specific role of REM sleep in regulating the neural substrates for emotional responsiveness.

Yet, brain activation patterns underlying these effects are still unknown. Objective: The present study examined the acute effects of glucose ingestion on prefrontal brain activation during the execution of a divided attention task in fasting non-diabetic older adults. Methods: Twenty older adults (60 years and older) took part in the study that included two experimental sessions. After an overnight fast, participants received either a glucose drink (50 g) or a placebo (saccharin) drink, following which they completed a dual-task. During task execution, prefrontal activation was recorded with functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). A repeated-measures design was used such that each participant served as his or her own control. The two experimental sessions were counterbalanced among participants and were performed two weeks apart. Results: When participants were in the glucose condition, they showed similar dual-task costs for both tasks, whereas in the placebo condition they prioritized one task over the other, with a significantly larger dual-task cost for the non-prioritized task (p < 0.01). Differential brain activation was also observed in right ventral-lateral prefrontal regions for oxygenated hemoglobin and deoxygenated hemoglobin, with more activation apparent in the glucose condition (p < 0.05). Furthermore, behavioral and activation data were influenced by individual differences in glucose regulation. Conclusions: Glucose ingestion appears to momentarily enhance fasting seniors' capacity to coordinate more equally two concurrent tasks and this is reflected in brain activation patterns.

Therefore, elucidating the neurobiological mechanisms controlling the boundaries between arousal, hyperarousal, and hypoarousal is a crucial endeavor in biological psychiatry. Substantial research over several decades has identified distinct arousal-promoting neural populations in the brain; however, how these nuclei act individually and collectively to promote and maintain wakefulness and various arousal states is unknown. We have recently applied optogenetic technology to the repertoire of techniques used to study arousal. Here, we discuss the recent results of these experiments and propose future use of this approach as a way to understand the complex dynamics of neural circuits controlling arousal and arousal-related behaviors.

An open-label, single-arm, phase 2 (PX-171-004) study of single-agent carfilzomib in bortezomib-naive patients with relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma	BLOOD			English	Article							PROTEASOME INHIBITOR CARFILZOMIB; ADAPTED THERAPY MSMART; IRREVERSIBLE INHIBITOR; MAYO STRATIFICATION; DOSE DEXAMETHASONE; PR-171; ESCALATION; MANAGEMENT; CANCER; POTENT	Carfilzomib is a selective proteasome inhibitor that binds irreversibly to its target. In phase 1 studies, carfilzomib elicited promising responses and an acceptable toxicity profile in patients with relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma (R/R MM). In the present phase 2, multicenter, open-label study, 129 bortezomib-naive patients with R/R MM (median of 2 prior therapies) were separated into Cohort 1, scheduled to receive intravenous carfilzomib 20 mg/m(2) for all treatment cycles, and Cohort 2, scheduled to receive 20 mg/m(2) for cycle 1 and then 27 mg/m(2) for all subsequent cycles. The primary end point was an overall response rate (>= partial response) of 42.4% in Cohort 1 and 52.2% in Cohort 2. The clinical benefit response (overall response rate + minimal response) was 59.3% and 64.2% in Cohorts 1 and 2, respectively. Median duration of response was 13.1 months and not reached, and median time to progression was 8.3 months and not reached, respectively. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events were fatigue (62.0%) and nausea (48.8%). Single-agent carfilzomib elicited a low incidence of peripheral neuropathy-17.1% overall (1 grade 3; no grade 4)-in these pretreated bortezomib-naive patients. The results of the present study support the use of carfilzomib in R/R MM patients. This trial is registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00530816.

ATLAS Collaboration	Search for FCNC single top-quark production at root s=7 TeV with the ATLAS detector	PHYSICS LETTERS B			English	Article						Top physics; Heavy-quark production; FCNC; Single top quark	CHANGING NEUTRAL CURRENTS; P(P)OVER-BAR COLLISIONS; SUPERSYMMETRIC MODELS; HADRON COLLIDERS; DECAYS; COUPLINGS	A search for the production of single top-quarks via flavour-changing neutral-currents is presented. Data collected with the ATLAS detector at a centre-of-mass energy of root s = 7 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 2.05 fb(-1), are used. Candidate events with a semileptonic top-quark decay signature are classified as signal- or background-like events by using several kinematic variables as input to a neural network. No signal is observed in the neural network output distribution and a Bayesian upper limit is placed on the production cross-section. The observed upper limit at 95% confidence level on the cross-section multiplied by the t -> Wb branching fraction is measured to be sigma(qg -> t) x B(t -> Wb) < 3.9 pb. This upper limit is converted using a model-independent approach into upper limits on the coupling strengths kappa(ugt)/Lambda < 6.9.10(-3) TeV-1 and kappa(cgt)/Lambda < 1.6.10(-2) TeV-1, where A is the new physics scale, and on the branching fractions B(t -> ug) < 5.7.10(-5) and B(t -> cg) < 2.7.10(-4).

Here, we showed that loss-of-function mutations in lin-4 microRNA increased axon attraction mediated by the netrin homolog UNC-6. The absence of lin-4 microRNA suppressed the axon guidance defects of anterior ventral microtubule (AVM) neurons caused by loss-of-function mutations in slt-1, which encodes a repulsive guidance cue. Selective expression of lin-4 microRNA in AVM neurons of lin-4-null animals indicated that the effect of lin-4 on AVM axon guidance was cell-autonomous. Promoter reporter analysis suggested that lin-4 was likely expressed strongly in AVM neurons during the developmental time frame that the axons are guided to their targets. In contrast, the lin-4 reporter was barely detectable in anterior lateral microtubule (ALM) neurons, axon guidance of which is insensitive to netrin. In AVM neurons, the transcription factor LIN-14, a target of lin-4 microRNA, stimulated UNC-6-mediated ventral guidance of the AVM axon. LIN-14 promoted attraction of the AVM axon through the UNC-6 receptor UNC-40 [the worm homolog of vertebrate Deleted in Colorectal Cancer (DCC)] and its cofactor MADD-2, which signals through both the UNC-34 (Ena) and the CED-10 (Rac1) downstream pathways. LIN-14 stimulated UNC-6-mediated axon attraction in part by increasing UNC-40 abundance. Our study indicated that lin-4 microRNA reduced the activity of LIN-14 to terminate UNC-6-mediated axon guidance of AVM neurons.

The Combined Dexamethasone/TSST Paradigm - A New Method for Psychoneuroendocrinology	PLOS ONE			English	Article							SALIVARY ALPHA-AMYLASE; REPEATED PSYCHOSOCIAL STRESS; RAT-BRAIN; PSYCHOLOGICAL STRESS; CARDIOVASCULAR RISK; CORTISOL RESPONSES; HEART-RATE; GLUCOCORTICOIDS; PITUITARY; SYSTEM	The two main physiological systems involved in the regulation of the stress response are the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and the sympathetic nervous system (SNS). However, the interaction of these systems on the stress response remains poorly understood. To better understand the cross-regulatory effects of the different systems involved in stress regulation, we developed a new stress paradigm that keeps the activity of the HPA constant when exposing subjects to psychosocial stress. Thirty healthy male participants were recruited and randomly assigned to either a dexamethasone (DEX; n = 15) or placebo (PLC; n = 15) group. All subjects were instructed to take the Dexamethasone (2 mg) or Placebo pill the night before coming to the laboratory to undergo the Trier Social Stress Task (TSST). Salivary cortisol, salivary alpha amylase (sAA), heart rate, blood pressure and subjective stress were assessed throughout the protocol. As expected, the DEX group presented with suppressed cortisol levels. In comparison, their heart rate was elevated by approximately ten base points compared to the PLC group, with increases throughout the protocol and during the TSST. Neither sAA, nor systolic or diastolic blood pressures showed significant group differences. Subjective stress levels significantly increased from baseline, and were found to be higher before and after the TSST after DEX compared to placebo. These results demonstrate a significant interaction between the HPA and the SNS during acute stress. The SNS activity was found to be elevated in the presence of a suppressed HPA axis, with some further effects on subjective levels of stress. The method to suppress the HPA prior to inducing stress was found to completely reliable, without any adverse side effects. Therefore, we propose this paradigm as a new method to investigate the interaction of the two major stress systems in the regulation of the stress response.

Weekly nab-Paclitaxel in Combination With Carboplatin Versus Solvent-Based Paclitaxel Plus Carboplatin as First-Line Therapy in Patients With Advanced Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer: Final Results of a Phase III Trial	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ONCOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	14th World Conference on Lung Cancer	JUL 03-07, 2011	Amsterdam, NETHERLANDS				ALBUMIN-BOUND PACLITAXEL; CLINICAL-TRIALS; CHEMOTHERAPY; GUIDELINES; CISPLATIN; ONCOLOGY	Purpose This phase III trial compared the efficacy and safety of albumin-bound paclitaxel (nab-paclitaxel) plus carboplatin with solvent-based paclitaxel (sb-paclitaxel) plus carboplatin in advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Patients and Methods In all, 1,052 untreated patients with stage IIIB to IV NSCLC were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive 100 mg/m(2) nab-paclitaxel weekly and carboplatin at area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) 6 once every 3 weeks (nab-PC) or 200 mg/m2 sb-paclitaxel plus carboplatin AUC 6 once every 3 weeks (sb-PC). The primary end point was objective overall response rate (ORR). Results On the basis of independent assessment, nab-PC demonstrated a significantly higher ORR than sb-PC (33% v 25%; response rate ratio, 1.313; 95% CI, 1.082 to 1.593; P = .005) and in patients with squamous histology (41% v 24%; response rate ratio, 1.680; 95% CI, 1.271 to 2.221; P < .001). nab-PC was as effective as sb-PC in patients with nonsquamous histology (ORR, 26% v 25%; P = .808). There was an approximately 10% improvement in progression-free survival (median, 6.3 v 5.8 months; hazard ratio [HR], 0.902; 95% CI, 0.767 to 1.060; P = .214) and overall survival (OS; median, 12.1 v 11.2 months; HR, 0.922; 95% CI, 0.797 to 1.066; P = .271) in the nab-PC arm versus the sb-PC arm, respectively. Patients >= 70 years old and those enrolled in North America showed a significantly increased OS with nab-PC versus sb-PC. Significantly less grade >= 3 neuropathy, neutropenia, arthralgia, and myalgia occurred in the nab-PC arm, and less thrombocytopenia and anemia occurred in the sb-PC arm. Conclusion The administration of nab-PC as first-line therapy in patients with advanced NSCLC was efficacious and resulted in a significantly improved ORR versus sb-PC, achieving the primary end point. nab-PC produced less neuropathy than sb-PC.

While recent studies report modulation of motor performance following action observation, the neurophysiological mechanism supporting these behavioral changes remains to be specifically defined. Here, we assessed whether the observation of a repetitive thumb movement - similarly to active motor practice - would inhibit subsequent long-term potentiation-like (LTP) plasticity induced by paired-associative stimulation (PAS). Before undergoing PAS, participants were asked to either 1) perform abductions of the right thumb as fast as possible; 2) passively observe someone else perform thumb abductions; or 3) passively observe a moving dot mimicking thumb movements. Motor evoked potentials (MEP) were used to assess cortical excitability before and after motor practice (or observation) and at two time points following PAS. Results show that, similarly to participants in the motor practice group, individuals observing repeated motor actions showed marked inhibition of PAS-induced LTP, while the "moving dot" group displayed the expected increase in MEP amplitude, despite differences in baseline excitability. Interestingly, LTP occlusion in the action-observation group was present even if no increase in cortical excitability or movement speed was observed following observation. These results suggest that mere observation of repeated hand actions is sufficient to induce LTP, despite the absence of motor learning.

Food and drug cues activate similar brain regions: A meta-analysis of functional MRI studies	PHYSIOLOGY & BEHAVIOR			English	Article						Reward; Food; Smoking; Brain imaging; fMRI; PET; Meta-analysis	STRIATUM/NUCLEUS ACCUMBENS ACTIVATION; ORBITOFRONTAL CORTEX; SMOKING CUES; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; LIMBIC ACTIVATION; DECISION-MAKING; MODULATES BRAIN; NICOTINE DEPENDENCE; APPETITIVE BEHAVIOR	In healthy individuals, food cues can trigger hunger and feeding behavior. Likewise, smoking cues can trigger craving and relapse in smokers. Brain imaging studies report that structures involved in appetitive behaviors and reward, notably the insula, striatum, amygdala and orbital frontal cortex, tend to be activated by both visual food and smoking cues. Here, by carrying out a meta-analysis of human neuro-imaging studies, we investigate the neural network activated by: 1) food versus neutral cues (14 studies. 142 foci) 2) smoking versus neutral cues (15 studies, 176 foci) 3) smoking versus neutral cues when correlated with craving scores (7 studies, 108 foci). PubMed was used to identify cue-reactivity imaging studies that compared brain response to visual food or smoking cues to neutral cues. Fourteen articles were identified for the food meta-analysis and fifteen articles were identified for the smoking meta-analysis. Six articles were identified for the smoking cue correlated with craving analysis. Meta-analyses were carried out using activation likelihood estimation. Food cues were associated with increased blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) response in the left amygdala, bilateral insula, bilateral orbital frontal cortex, and striatum. Smoking cues were associated with increased BOLD signal in the same areas, with the exception of the insula. However, the smoking meta-analysis of brain maps correlating cue-reactivity with subjective craving did identify the insula, suggesting that insula activation is only found when craving levels are high. The brain areas identified here are involved in learning, memory and motivation, and their cue-induced activity is an index of the incentive salience of the cues. Using meta-analytic techniques to combine a series of studies, we found that food and smoking cues activate comparable brain networks. There is significant overlap in brain regions responding to conditioned cues associated with natural and drug rewards. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	[Tang, D. W.; Fellows, L.

This is particularly true for tracked 3D ultrasound images of the brain. Methods: In 2010, pre- and postoperative magnetic resonance and intraoperative ultrasound images were acquired from brain tumor patients involved in the authors' imaging study at the Montreal Neurological Institute. Results: These data are available online at the Montreal Neurological Institute's Brain Images of Tumors for Evaluation database, termed here the MNI BITE database. It contains ultrasound and magnetic resonance images from 14 patients. Each patient underwent a preoperative and a postoperative T1-weighted magnetic resonance scan with gadolinium enhancement, and multiple intraoperative B-mode images were acquired before and after resection.

J	Sideris, L; Dube, P; Rinke, A				Sideris, Lucas; Dube, Pierre; Rinke, Anja			Antitumor Effects of Somatostatin Analogs in Neuroendocrine Tumors	ONCOLOGIST			English	Article						Octreotide; Lanreotide; Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors; Gastrointestinal neuroendocrine tumors; Carcinoid	ENDOCRINE GASTROENTEROPANCREATIC TUMORS; MALIGNANT CARCINOID-SYNDROME; NANETS CONSENSUS GUIDELINES; RELEASE LANREOTIDE; OCTREOTIDE ACETATE; GASTROINTESTINAL TUMORS; INTERFERON-ALPHA; MANAGEMENT; DIAGNOSIS; EFFICACY	Background. For decades, somatostatin analogs (including octreotide and lanreotide) have been indicated for relief of the symptoms of flushing, diarrhea, and wheezing associated with secretory neuroendocrine tumors (NETs). Recently, it has been suggested that somatostatin analogs may provide direct and indirect antitumor effects in secretory and nonsecretory NETs in addition to symptom control in secretory NETs. Methods. A systematic review of MEDLINE was conducted to identify studies that investigated the antitumor effects of octreotide or lanreotide for patients with NETs. Additional studies not published in the peer-reviewed literature were identified by searching online abstracts. Results. In all, 17 octreotide trials and 11 lanreotide trials that included antitumor effects were identified. Partial response rates were between 0% and 31%, and stable disease rates were between 15% and 89%. Octreotide was the only somatostatin analog for which results of a phase III, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial that investigated antitumor effects were published. After 6 months of treatment in this randomized phase 111 trial, stable disease was observed in 67% of patients (hazard ratio for time to disease progression: 0.34; 95% confidence interval: 0.20-0.59; p = .000072). Conclusions. In addition to symptom control for NETs, the data support an antitumor effect of somatostatin analogs and suggest that they may slow tumor growth. Long-acting repeatable octreotide has been shown to have an antitumor effect in a randomized phase III trial in midgut NETs, whereas results are pending in a corresponding controlled trial with lanreotide for patients with intestinal and pancreatic primary NETs.

Imprisonment, alcohol dependence and risk of delusional disorder: A cross-sectional study	REVUE D EPIDEMIOLOGIE ET DE SANTE PUBLIQUE			English	Article						Psychiatric epidemiology; Prison; Delusional disorder; Alcohol dependence; Prison psychosis	LONG-TERM IMPRISONMENT; INTERNATIONAL NEUROPSYCHIATRIC INTERVIEW; SUBSTANCE-ABUSE; DSM-IV; MENTAL-DISORDERS; PREVALENCE; PRISONERS; VALIDATION; COMMUNITY; VARIABLES	Background. - Compared to the general population, an excess of psychotic illnesses, major depression and dependence disorders among prisoners has been reported. However, the impact of prison on detainees' psychopathology has rarely been studied. Objective. - To determine the mental disorders liable to develop or regress on entry into prison and over time. Method. - Two samples of French prisoners detained in local prisons were interviewed using the same methodology. The first sample consisted of 267 new arrivals. The second was a random sample of 450 prisoners. Diagnoses were assessed using a thorough methodology: each prisoner was interviewed for approximately 2 hours by two clinicians. One of the clinicians used a structured clinical interview, which generates DSM IV diagnoses (MINI plus v 5.0); the second completed the procedure with an open clinical interview. The final DSM IV diagnoses were obtained as a consensus between the two approaches. Multilevel logistic regressions were used to take into account potential confounders. Results. - Prevalence rates of mental disorders were substantially higher in prison even for the sample of newcomers (major depression disorder: 24.7%, substance dependence: 17.6% and schizophrenia: 4.1%). Alcohol dependence disorder was significantly more frequent in the sample of newcomers (OR 1.84 [1.01-3.51]). No significant difference was evidenced between samples for substance dependence disorder. Psychotic disorders were significantly less frequent at entry into prison, particularly delusional disorder (OR 0.29 [0.08-0.98]). Conclusion. - This study shows the contrasted potential effects of prison on psychopathology: alcohol dependence disorders were significantly more frequent for the newcomers, while the frequency of delusional disorders was lower. This evidence is arguing in favour of the validity of the old concept: prison psychosis. Moreover, prisoners should receive relevant help from clinicians to cope with these disorders.

Neural changes associated with appetite information processing in schizophrenic patients after 16 weeks of olanzapine treatment	TRANSLATIONAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						appetite; fMRI; insula; metabolic changes; olanzapine; schizophrenia	INDUCED WEIGHT-GAIN; BINGE-EATING DISORDER; ATYPICAL ANTIPSYCHOTICS; INGESTIVE BEHAVIOR; BODYWEIGHT GAIN; BULIMIA-NERVOSA; LEPTIN LEVELS; ANIMAL-MODEL; FOOD-INTAKE; CLOZAPINE	There is evidence that some atypical antipsychotics, including olanzapine, can produce unwanted metabolic side effects, weight gain and diabetes. However, neuronal correlates of change related to food information processing have not been investigated with these medications. We studied the effect of a pharmacological manipulation with an antipsychotic known to cause weight gain on metabolites, cognitive tasks and neural correlates related to food regulation. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging in conjunction with a task requiring visual processing of appetitive stimuli in schizophrenic patients and healthy controls before and after 16 weeks of antipsychotic medication with olanzapine. In patients, the psychological and neuronal changes associated following the treatment correlated with appetite control measures and metabolite levels in fasting blood samples. After 16 weeks of olanzapine treatment, the patients gained weight, increased their waist circumference, had fewer positive schizophrenia symptoms, a reduced ghrelin plasma concentration and an increased concentration of triglycerides, insulin and leptin. In premotor area, somatosensory cortices as well as bilaterally in the fusiform gyri, the olanzapine treatment increased the neural activity related to appetitive information in schizophrenic patients to similar levels relative to healthy individuals. However, a higher increase in sensitivity to appetitive stimuli after the treatment was observed in insular cortices, amygdala and cerebellum in schizophrenic patients as compared with healthy controls. Furthermore, these changes in neuronal activity correlated with changes in some metabolites and cognitive measurements related to appetite regulation.

Although the exact origin of these disorders is not known, they may be the consequence of diffuse axonal injury (DAI) impacting structural integrity. In the present study, we compared structural integrity at the subacute and late stages after mTBI and in case of PCS, using diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI). Fifty-three mTBI patients were investigated and compared with 40 healthy controls. All patients underwent a DWI examination at the subacute (8-21 days) and late (6 months) phases after injury. MTBI patients with PCS were detected at the subacute phase using the ICD-10 classification. Groupwise differences in structural integrity were investigated using Tract-Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS). A loss of structural integrity was found in mTBI patients at the subacute phase but partially resolved over time. Moreover, we observed that mTBI patients with PCS had greater and wider structural impairment than patients without PCS. These damages persisted over time for PCS patients, while mTBI patients without PCS partly recovered. In conclusion, our results strengthen the relationship between structural integrity and PCS.

J	Cloutier, M; Wellstead, P				Cloutier, M.; Wellstead, P.			Dynamic modelling of protein and oxidative metabolisms simulates the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease	IET SYSTEMS BIOLOGY			English	Article							SYNUCLEIN TRANSGENIC MICE; ALPHA-SYNUCLEIN; MITOCHONDRIAL DYSFUNCTION; CELL-DEATH; COMPLEX-I; DOPAMINE; NEURONS; AGGREGATION; DEGRADATION; MECHANISMS	Research into Parkinson's disease (PD) is difficult and time consuming. It is a complex condition that develops over many decades in the human brain. For such apparently intractable diseases, mathematical models can offer an additional means of investigation. As a contribution to this process, the authors have developed an ordinary differential equation model of the most important cellular processes that have been associated with PD. The model describes the following processes: (i) cellular generation and scavenging of reactive oxygen species; (ii) the possible damage and removal of the protein alpha-synuclein and, (iii) feedback interactions between damaged alpha-synuclein and reactive oxygen species. Simulation results show that the Parkinsonian condition, with elevated oxidative stress and misfolded alpha-synuclein accumulation, can be induced in the model by known PD risk factors such as ageing, exposure to toxins and genetic defects. The significant outcome of the paper is the demonstration that it is possible to reproduce in silico the multi-factorial interactions that characterise the pathogenesis of PD. As such, the model provides a systematic explanation of the variability and heterogeneity of PD and provides the basis for computational studies of further facets of this complex multi-factorial condition.

Feedback motif for the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease	IET SYSTEMS BIOLOGY			English	Article							ALPHA-SYNUCLEIN; MITOCHONDRIAL DYSFUNCTION; OXIDATIVE STRESS; METABOLISM; DOPAMINE; MECHANISMS; DYNAMICS; BIOLOGY; NEURONS; DEATH	Previous article on the integrative modelling of Parkinson's disease (PD) described a mathematical model with properties suggesting that PD pathogenesis is associated with a feedback-induced biochemical bistability. In this article, the authors show that the dynamics of the mathematical model can be extracted and distilled into an equivalent two-state feedback motif whose stability properties are controlled by multi-factorial combinations of risk factors and genetic mutations associated with PD. Based on this finding, the authors propose a principle for PD pathogenesis in the form of the switch-like transition of a bistable feedback process from 'healthy' homeostatic levels of reactive oxygen species and the protein alpha-synuclein, to an alternative 'disease' state in which concentrations of both molecules are stable at the damagingly high-levels associated with PD. The bistability is analysed using the rate curves and steady-state response characteristics of the feedback motif. In particular, the authors show how a bifurcation in the feedback motif marks the pathogenic moment at which the 'healthy' state is lost and the 'disease' state is initiated. Further analysis shows how known risks (such as: age, toxins and genetic predisposition) modify the stability characteristics of the feedback motif in a way that is compatible with known features of PD, and which explain properties such as: multi-factorial causality, variability in susceptibility and severity, multi-timescale progression and the special cases of familial Parkinson's and Parkinsonian symptoms induced purely by toxic stress.

Ventromedial frontal lobe damage disrupts the accuracy, but not the speed, of value-based preference judgments	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Decision-making; Frontal lobe function; Orbitofrontal cortex; Neuropsychology; Neuroeconomics	HUMAN ORBITOFRONTAL CORTEX; DECISION-MAKING; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; REWARD VALUE; HUMANS; REVERSAL; SIGNALS; CHOICE; NEUROBIOLOGY; UNCERTAINTY	The ventromedial frontal lobe (VMF) plays a role in decision making, but its precise function remains unclear. Several lines of evidence suggest that VMF is involved in representing the economic value of options. A prior study from our lab has shown that patients with lesions to the VMF are less consistent than controls in making simple preference judgments between stimuli presented in pairs. Here, we followed up that observation in a larger sample, using more sensitive tasks, and examining the category-specificity of this effect. Patients with damage to VMF (N = 15) were compared to patients with frontal damage sparing that region (N = 8) and to demographically matched healthy control participants (N = 23). Five separate preference tasks were administered, requiring subjects to indicate their preference for 12 stimuli presented two at a time, in all possible combinations. Categories included fruits, vegetables, colors, landscapes, and puppies. Choices were analyzed for internal consistency, and decision times were measured. Three control tasks with the same format, but requiring perceptual judgments, were also administered. VMF patients were significantly more erratic than both non-VMF and healthy control participants in their preference judgments across all stimulus categories. However, decision times, and the relationship between decision time and relative value, were similar to that seen in control participants. The groups did not differ in perceptual judgment performance. These findings add further weight to the claim that VMF plays a critical role in simple value-based decision-making under conditions of certainty. This region appears to be necessary for consistent choices across a variety of stimulus categories, supporting the view that human VMF represents the (relative) value of decision options rather generally. That such damage impairs decision 'accuracy' without affecting reaction time has implications for theories of the role of VMF in decision-making, arguing that this region may be critical for linking a particular value to a particular option.

It is assumed that they thereby rely more heavily on echolocation, proprioceptive signals and environmental cues such as ambient temperature and audition to compensate for their lack of vision. Little is known, however, about the neural mechanisms underlying spatial navigation in blind individuals in settings where these cues are absent. We therefore measured behavioural performance and blood oxygenation-level dependant (BOLD) responses using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in congenitally blind and blindfolded sighted participants while they navigated through a tactile multiple T-maze. Both groups learned the maze task at a similar pace. In blind participants, tactile maze navigation was associated with increased BOLD responses in the right hippocampus and parahippocampus, occipital cortex and fusiform gyrus. Blindfolded sighted controls did not show increased BOLD responses in these areas; instead they activated the caudate nucleus and thalamus. Both groups activated the precuneus during tactile maze navigation. We conclude that cross-modal plastic processes allow for the recruitment of the hippocampal complex and visual cortex in congenital blindness. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Word-finding difficulties and comprehension deficits despite relatively preserved cognitive functions are characteristic symptoms during the first two years, and distinguish PPA from other dementia types like Alzheimer's disease. However, the dynamics of changes in language and non-linguistic abilities are not well understood. Most studies on progression used cross-sectional designs, which provide only limited insight into the course of the disease. Here we report the results of a longitudinal study in three cases of logopenic PPA over a period of 18 months, with exemplary longitudinal data from one patient even over 46 months. A comprehensive battery of neurolinguistic and neuropsychological tests was applied four times at intervals of six months. Over this period, deterioration of verbal abilities such as picture naming, story retelling, and semantic word recall was found, and the individual decline was quantified and compared between the three patients. Furthermore, decrease in non-verbal skills such as divided attention and increasing apraxia was observed in all three patients. In addition, inter-subject variability in the progression with different focuses was observed, with one patient developing a non-fluent PPA variant. The longitudinal, multivariate investigation of logopenic PPA thus provides novel insights into the progressive deterioration of verbal as well as non-verbal abilities. These deficits may further interact and thus form a multi-causal basis for the patients' problems in every-day life which need to be considered when planning individually targeted intervention in PPA (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

A novel epileptic seizure detector and a dedicated electrical stimulator were assembled together with common recording electrodes to complete the proposed prosthesis. The seizure detector was implemented in CMOS 0.18-mu m by incorporating a new seizure detection algorithm that models time-amplitude and -frequency relationship in icEEG. The detector was validated offline on ten patients with refractory epilepsy and showed excellent performance for early detection of seizures. The electrical stimulator, used for suppressing the developing seizure, is composed of two biphasic channels and was assembled with embedded FPGA in a miniature PCB. The stimulator efficiency was evaluated on cadaveric animal brain tissue in an in vitro morphologic electrical model. Spatial characteristics of the voltage distribution in cortex were assessed in an attempt to identify optimal stimulation parameters required to affect the suspected epileptic focus. The experimental results suggest that lower frequency stimulation parameters cause significant amount of shunting of current through the cerebrospinal fluid; however higher frequency stimulation parameters produce effective spatial voltage distribution with lower stimulation charge.

New Insights in Perinatal Arterial Ischemic Stroke by Assessing Brain Perfusion	TRANSLATIONAL STROKE RESEARCH			English	Article						Newborn brain; Perinatal stroke; Magnetic resonance imaging; Arterial spin labeling; Brain perfusion; Cerebral blood flow	CEREBRAL INFARCTION; 3 TESLA; INFANTS; MANAGEMENT; DIAGNOSIS; SUSCEPTIBILITY; MECHANISMS; CHILDREN; DISEASE; FLOW	Perinatal arterial ischemic stroke (AIS) is an important cause of long-term morbidity in children. Thus, there is an urgent need to better understand the mechanisms of stroke in newborns in order to develop effective treatment and prevention strategies. The purpose of this study was to assess brain perfusion within the first month of life in newborns with AIS. In this study, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and perfusion imaging by arterial spin labeling (ASL) were used to assess brain perfusion in four term newborns with AIS. One patient had a stroke within the territory of the right middle cerebral artery (MCA); the other three patients had a stroke within the territory of the left MCA. None of them displayed any hemorrhagic component. All four patients demonstrated abnormal brain perfusion in the stroke area. Cerebral blood flow (CBF) within the stroke area was increased in patient # 1. In all other three patients, CBF was decreased within the stroke center and increased in the periphery of the stroke area. These results show the feasibility of the ASL sequence in newborns with AIS and support its addition to the current MRI protocol used in these newborns as it provides useful information on brain hemodynamics. Its value for identifying salvageable tissue in newborns needs to be further assessed, as well as its potential role in stroke follow-up and for tissue-specific treatment screening.

These actions are absent in nkcc1(-/-) knock-out mice, indicating that HCD interact with NKCC1 rather than with other potential targets. These findings also suggest that VSMC-specifi c inhibitors of NKCC1 may be considered potential pharmacological therapeutic tools in treatment of hypertension. It should be underlined that side by side with attenuation of peripheral resistance and systemic blood pressure, HCD blocked myogenic tone (MT) in renal afferent arterioles. Keeping this in mind, attenuation of MT might be a mechanism underlying the prevalence of end-stage renal disease documented in hypertensive African-Americans with decreased NKCC1 activity and in hypertensive patients subjected to chronic HCD treatment. The role of NKCC1-mediated MT in protection of the brain, heart, and other encapsulated organs deserves further investigation.

In many neurological diseases, synapse structure and AMPA receptor function are altered, thus making AMPA receptors potential therapeutic targets for clinical intervention. The work summarized in this review suggests a link between AMPA receptor function and debilitating neuropathologies, and discusses the current state of therapies targeting AMPA receptors in four diseases. In amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, AMPA receptors allow cytotoxic levels of calcium into neurons, leading to motor neuron death. Likewise, in some epilepsies, overactivation of AMPA receptors leads to neuron damage. The same is true for ischemia, where oxygen deprivation leads to excitotoxicity. Conversely, Alzheimers disease is characterized by decreased AMPA activation and synapse loss. Unfortunately, many clinical studies have had limited success by directly targeting AMPA receptors in these diseases. We also discuss how the use of AMPA receptor modulators, commonly known as ampakines, in neurological diseases initially seemed promising in animal studies, but mostly ineffective in clinical trials. We propose that indirectly affecting AMPA receptors, such as by modulating transmembrane AMPA receptor regulatory proteins or, more generally, by regulating glutamatergic transmission, may provide new therapeutic potential for neurological disorders.

In normal young adults, mixed results have been reported, with studies showing a positive, a negative, or a null effect of singing on verbal recall. Several factors can account for this limited aid of music. First, the familiarity of the melody might play a role. Second, successive learning sessions and long-term retention intervals may be necessary. These two factors are considered here in a case study of a participant who suffers from mild Alzheimer's disease. As expected, initial learning of new lyrics showed better performance for the spoken condition over the sung version unless the lyrics are learned on a familiar melody. After repeated learning episodes, learning sung lyrics - even on an unfamiliar melody - led to better retention of words. Thus, music may provide a more robust aid for consolidation in memory than spoken lyrics alone. The therapeutic implications of these results are discussed.

The osmotic actions of increased glutamine synthesis in astrocytes are considered to be causally related to brain edema and its complications (intracranial hypertension, brain herniation) in ALF. However studies using multinuclear H-1- and C-13-NMR spectroscopy demonstrate that neither brain glutamine concentrations per se nor brain glutamine synthesis rates correlate with encephalopathy grade or the presence of brain edema in ALF. An alternative mechanism is now proposed whereby the newly synthesized glutamine is trapped within the astrocyte as a consequence of down-regulation of its high affinity glutamine transporter SNAT5 in ALF. Restricted transfer out of the cell rather than increased synthesis within the cell could potentially explain the cell swelling/brain edema in ALF. Moreover, the restricted transfer of glutamine from the astrocyte to the adjacent glutamatergic nerve terminal (where glutamine serves as immediate precursor for the releasable/transmitter pool of glutamate) could result in decreased excitatory transmission and excessive neuroinhibition that is characteristic of encephalopathy in ALF. Paradoxically, in spite of renewed interest in arterial ammonia as a predictor of raised intracranial pressure and brain herniation in ALF, ammonia-lowering agents aimed at reduction of ammonia production in the gut have so far been shown to be of limited value in the prevention of these cerebral consequences. Mild hypothermia, shown to prevent brain edema and intracranial hypertension in both experimental and human ALF, does so independent of effects on brain glutamine synthesis; whether or not hypothermia restores expression levels of SNAT5 in ALF awaits further studies. While inhibitors of brain glutamine synthesis such as methionine sulfoximine, have been proposed for the prevention of brain edema in ALF, potential adverse effects have so far limited their applicability.

Neuroinflammation in acute liver failure: Mechanisms and novel therapeutic targets (Reprinted from Neurochemistry International, vol 59, pg 830-836, 2011)	NEUROCHEMISTRY INTERNATIONAL			English	Reprint						Neuroinflammation; Hepatic encephalopathy; Acute liver failure; Ammonia; Proinflammatory cytokines; Microglia	FULMINANT HEPATIC-FAILURE; NECROSIS-FACTOR-ALPHA; NUCLEAR-MAGNETIC-RESONANCE; GLUTAMATE TRANSPORTER; N-ACETYLCYSTEINE; BRAIN EDEMA; INTRACRANIAL HYPERTENSION; ARTERIAL AMMONIA; OXIDATIVE STRESS; MILD HYPOTHERMIA	It is increasingly evident that neuroinflammatory mechanisms are implicated in the pathogenesis of the central nervous system (CNS) complications (intracranial hypertension, brain herniation) of acute liver failure (ALF). Neuroinflammation in ALF is characterized by microglial activation and arterio-venous difference studies as well as studies of gene expression confirm local brain production and release of proinflammatory cytokines including TNF-alpha and the interleukins IL-1 beta and IL-6. Although the precise nature of the glial cell responsible for brain cytokine synthesis is not yet established, evidence to date supports a role for both astrocytes and microglia. The neuroinflammatory response in ALF progresses in parallel with the progression of hepatic encephalopathy (HE) and with the severity of brain edema (astrocyte swelling). Mechanisms responsible for the relaying of signals from the failing liver to the brain include transduction of systemic proinflammatory signals as well as the effects of increased brain lactate leading to increased release of cytokines from both astrocytes and microglia. There is evidence in support of a synergistic effect of proinflammatory cytokines and ammonia in the pathogenesis of HE and brain edema in ALF. Therapeutic implications of the findings of a neuroinflammatory response in ALF are multiple. Removal of both ammonia and proinflammatory cytokines is possible using antibiotics or albumen dialysis. Mild hypothermia reduces brain ammonia transfer, brain lactate production, microglial activation and proinflammatory cytokine production resulting in reduced brain edema and intracranial pressure in ALF. N-Acetylcysteine acts as both an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent at both peripheral and central sites of action independently resulting in slowing of HE progression and prevention of brain edema. Novel treatments that directly target the neuroinflammatory response in ALF include the use of etanercept, a TNF-alpha neutralizing molecule and minocycline, an agent with potent inhibitory actions on microglial activation that are independent of its antimicrobial properties; both agents have been shown to be effective in reducing neuroinflammation and in preventing the CNS complications of ALF. Translation of these findings to the clinic has the potential to provide rational targeted approaches to the prevention and treatment of these complications in the near future. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Since the infectious forms of prions are transmissible and highly resistant to chemical and physical decontamination methods routinely used in healthcare, they represent a challenge for science, medicine, and public health/food systems. Suitable decontamination procedures have been proposed, but they are generally incompatible with the materials from which medical devices are made. In this study, we evaluate a cold gaseous-plasma treatment, based on the outflow from a N2?O2 microwave discharge, as an alternative decontamination tool against both the non-infectious (PrPC) and infectious (PrPSc) forms of prion proteins. The efficiency of the plasma treatment on these proteins is assessed using an in vitro assay as well as an in vivo bioassay. We showed by Enzyme-Linked Immuno-Sorbent Assay (ELISA) that the N2?O2 discharge afterglow reduces the immunoreactivity of both non-infectious recombinant and pathogenic prion proteins deposited on polystyrene substrates. Tests done in vivo demonstrate that exposure to the cold-plasma flowing afterglow achieves significant decontamination of stainless steel sutures inoculated with infectious forms of prions to be implanted in mice.

Functional connectivity methods are based on the correlation of the blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal between brain regions, which exhibit consistent and reproducible functional networks from resting state data. The aim of this study is to compare functional connectivity of patients with MTLE during the interictal period with healthy subjects. We hypothesize that patients show reduced functional connectivity compared to controls, the interest being to determine which regions show this reduction. Methods: We selected electroencephalographyfunctional magnetic resonance imaging (EEG-fMRI) resting state data without EEG spikes from 16 patients with right and 7 patients with left MTLE. EEG-fMRI resting state data of 23 healthy subjects matched for age, sex, and manual preference were selected as controls. Four volumes of interest in the left and right amygdalae and hippocampi (LA, RA, LH, and RH) were manually segmented in the anatomic MRI of each subject. The averaged BOLD time course within each volume of interest was used to detect brain regions with BOLD signal correlated with it. Group differences between patients and controls were estimated. Key Findings: In patients with right MTLE, group difference functional connectivity maps (RMTLE - controls) showed for RA and RH decreased connectivity with the brain areas of the default mode network (DMN), the ventromesial limbic prefrontal regions, and contralateral mesial temporal structures; and for LA and LH, decreased connectivity with DMN and contralateral hippocampus. Additional decreased connectivity was found between LA and pons and between LH and ventromesial limbic prefrontal structures. In patients with left MTLE, functional connectivity maps (LMTLE - controls) showed for LA and LH decreased connectivity with DMN, contralateral hippocampus, and bilateral ventromesial limbic prefrontal regions; no change in connectivity was detected for RA; and for RH, there was decreased connectivity with DMN, bilateral ventromesial limbic prefrontal regions, and contralateral amygdala and hippocampus. Significance: In unilateral MTLE, amygdala and hippocampus on the affected and to a lesser extent on the healthy side are less connected, and are also less connected with the dopaminergic mesolimbic and the DMNs. Changes in functional connectivity between mesial temporal lobe structures and these structures may explain cognitive and psychiatric impairments often found in patients with MTLE.

To investigate this hypothesis, we performed genome-wide mapping in 119 multigenerational families from a population in the Saguenay-Lac-St-Jean region with a known founder effect using 58 000 single-nucleotide polymorphisms and 437 microsatellite markers to identify genetic components of the following factors: habitual alcohol, tobacco and coffee use; response to mental and physical stress; obesity-related traits; and heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP) measures. Habitual alcohol and/or tobacco users had attenuated HR responses to mental stress compared with non-users, whereas hypertensive individuals had stronger HR and systolic BP responses to mental stress and a higher obesity index than normotensives. Genetic mappings uncovered numerous shared genes among substance use, stress response, obesity and hemodynamic traits, including CAMK4, CNTN4, DLG2, FHIT, GRID2, ITPR2, NOVA1 and PRKCE, forming network of interacting proteins, sharing synaptic function and display higher and patterned expression profiles in brain-related tissues; moreover, pathway analysis of shared genes pointed to long-term potentiation. Subgroup genetic mappings uncovered additional shared synaptic genes, including CAMK4, CNTN5 and DNM3 (hypertension-specific); CNTN4, DNM3, FHIT and ITPR1 (sex-specific), having protein interactions with genes driven from general analysis. In summary, consistent with the observed phenotypic correlations, we found substantial overlap among genomic determinants of these traits in synapse, which supports the notion that the neural synapse may be a shared interface behind substance use, stress, obesity, HR, BP as well as the observed sex-and hypertension-specific genetic differences.

Touching and feeling: differences in pleasant touch processing between glabrous and hairy skin in humans	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						C-tactile afferent; emotion; PET; touch	UNMYELINATED TACTILE AFFERENTS; HUMAN ORBITOFRONTAL CORTEX; C FIBERS; INSULAR CORTEX; GENTLE TOUCH; HUMAN BRAIN; UNITS; NEURONS; PAIN; REPRESENTATION	Previous functional magnetic resonance imaging studies in two rare patients, together with microneurography and psychophysical observations in healthy subjects, have demonstrated a system of mechanosensitive C-fiber tactile (CT) afferents sensitive to slowly moving stimuli. They project to the posterior insular cortex and signal pleasant aspects of touch. Importantly, CTs have not been found in the glabrous skin of the hand, yet it is commonly observed that glabrous skin touch is also perceived as pleasant. Here we asked if the brain processing of pleasant touch differs between hairy and glabrous skin by stroking the forearm and glabrous skin of the hand during positron emission tomography. The data showed that, when contrasting slow brush stroking on the forearm with slow brush stroking on the palm, there were significant activations of the posterior insular cortex and mid-anterior orbitofrontal cortex. The opposite contrast showed a significant activation of the somatosensory cortices. Although concurrent psychophysical ratings showed no differences in intensity or pleasantness ratings, a subsequent touch questionnaire in which subjects used a newly developed touch perception task showed significant difference for the two body sites. Emotional descriptors received higher ratings on the forearm and sensory descriptors were rated more highly on the palm. The present findings are consistent with the hypothesis that pleasant touch from hairy skin, mediated by CT afferents, is processed in the limbic-related cortex and represents an innate non-learned process. In contrast, pleasant touch from glabrous skin, mediated by A-beta afferents, is processed in the somatosensory cortex and represents an analytical process dependent on previous tactile experiences.

Pathogenetic mechanisms involved in AIS were modeled as (a) a form of neuromuscular scoliosis (in conjunction with an adverse mechanical environment such as bipedality), in which hormonal and other chemical factors act as regulators of skeletal muscle tone and function; (b) as a consequence of an abnormality in growth of the spinal column (in conjunction with an adverse mechanical environment such as bipedality), in which hormones and other chemical factors act as regulators of growth; and (c) as a mechanical failure of one side of the vertebral column due to a defect in trabecular formation or mineralization (in conjunction with an adverse mechanical environment such as bipedality); in which hormonal and other chemical factors act as regulators of bone formation, mineralization and/or resorption. Current evidence supporting these models individually or in combination is discussed.

Identification of gadolinium-enhancing lesions is particularly challenging because the vast majority of enhancing voxels are associated with normal structures, particularly blood vessels. Furthermore, these lesions are typically small and in close proximity to vessels. In this paper, we present an automatic, probabilistic framework for segmentation of gadolinium-enhancing lesions in MS using conditional random fields. Our approach, through the integration of different components, encodes different information such as correspondence between the intensities and tissue labels, patterns in the labels, or patterns in the intensities. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on 80 multimodal clinical datasets acquired from relapsing-remitting MS patients in the context of multicenter clinical trials. The experimental results exhibit a sensitivity of 98% with a low false positive lesion count. The performance of the proposed algorithm is also compared to a logistic regression classifier, a support vector machine and a Markov random field approach. The results demonstrate superior performance of the proposed algorithm at successfully detecting all of the gadolinium-enhancing lesions while maintaining a low false positive lesion count.

Development of state estimation explains improvements in sensorimotor performance across childhood	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						motor development; visuomotor; multisensory; reaching	ARM MOVEMENTS; MOTOR TRANSFORMATIONS; REACHING MOVEMENTS; AIMING MOVEMENTS; FEEDBACK-CONTROL; YOUNG-CHILDREN; INTEGRATION; MODELS; CEREBELLUM; INFORMATION	King BR, Oliveira MA, Contreras-Vidal JL, Clark JE. Development of state estimation explains improvements in sensorimotor performance across childhood. J Neurophysiol 107: 3040-3049, 2012. First published February 29, 2012; doi:10.1152/jn.00932.2011.-Previous developmental research examining sensorimotor control of the arm in school-age children has demonstrated age-related improvements in movement kinematics. However, the mechanisms that underlie these age-related improvements are still unclear. This study hypothesized that changes in sensorimotor performance across childhood can be attributed, in part, to the development of state estimation, defined as estimates computed by the central nervous system, which specify both current and future hand positions and velocities (i.e., hand "state"). Two behavioral experiments were conducted, in which 6- to 12-year-old children and young adults executed goal-directed arm movements. Results from Experiment 1 revealed that young children (i.e., similar to 6-8 years) have less precise proprioceptive feedback for static (i.e., stationary) hand state estimation compared with older children (i.e., similar to 10-12 years), resulting in increased variability of target-directed reaching movements. Experiment 2 demonstrated that young children rely on delayed and unreliable state estimates during the execution of goal-directed hand movements (i.e., dynamic state estimation), resulting in both increased movement errors and directional variability. Collectively, these results suggest that improvements in sensorimotor behavior across childhood can be attributed, at least partially, to the development of both static and dynamic state estimation.

How they interact, though, is not yet fully understood. In this study, single-unit extracellular recordings were used to monitor dorsal raphe nucleus (DR) 5-HT neuronal activity in anesthetized rats, under basal conditions (CTRL), in response to MLT administration, and after pinealectomy (PX) across the light-dark cycle. Under basal conditions, the number of spontaneously active 5-HT neurons and their firing rate were both significantly lower in the dark phase. In the light phase, administration of MLT at low doses (0.5-1 mg/kg, i.v.) decreased 5-HT firing activity. This inhibitory effect of MLT was completely blocked by the MT1/MT2 receptor antagonist luzindole, but not by the selective MT2 receptor antagonist 4P-PDOT, the selective 5-HT1A receptor antagonist WAY100635, or by the alpha(2) adrenoceptor antagonist idazoxan. In the opposite experiment, PX increased 5-HT firing activity in the dark phase, and this was reversed by MLT administration (1 mg/kg, i.v.). Finally, in a forced swim test, MLT (1 mg/kg, i.p.) increased immobility time and decreased swimming behavior. Together, these results suggest that nocturnal MLT secretion imposes tonic inhibitory control over a sub-population of DR 5-HT neurons. This MLT-induced decrease in 5-HT neurotransmission may represent a biological mechanism underlying mood disorders characterized by increased MLT secretion, such as seasonal affective disorder.

Inattention and Hyperactivity Predict Alterations in Specific Neural Circuits Among 6-Year-Old Boys	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF CHILD AND ADOLESCENT PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						Conners' Parent Rating Scale; diffusion tensor imaging; subcortical shapes; cortical thickness; fractional anisotropy map	ATTENTION-DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; EVENT-RELATED FMRI; RESPONSE-INHIBITION; CORTICAL THICKNESS; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; GRAY-MATTER; CHILDREN; ABNORMALITIES; BRAIN; ADHD	Objective: Assessment of inattention and hyperactivity in preschoolers is highly dependent upon parental reports. Such reports are compromised by parental attitudes and mental health. Our study aimed to examine associations of inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity from maternal reports on the Conners' Parent Rating Scale (CPRS) with brain morphology assessed using structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in 6-year-old boys. Method: Large deformation diffeomorphic metric brain mapping was used to assess brain morphology on MRI and DTI in 96 six-year-old boys, including cortical thickness, subcortical shapes, and fractional anisotropy (FA) of deep white matter tracts (DWMTs). Linear regression examined associations between these measures of brain structures and mothers' CPRS ratings of their child's inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity. Results: Our results revealed that temporal and parietal cortices, as well as posterior white matter and callosal tracts are associated with inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity symptoms among six-year-old boys. Inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity symptoms share common neural circuits, but hyperactivity/impulsivity ratings associate with more extensive cortical areas, such as frontal regions, and with white matter tracts emphasizing executive control. There were no associations detected between inattention (or hyperactivity/impulsivity) and the shape of subcortical structures. Conclusions: Our results suggested specific rather than widespread neural circuits involved in inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity in young children, which is congruent with existing findings in older children and adolescents, and in adults with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Hence, our study supported the dimensional view of ADHD, that is, that symptoms of inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity lie on a continuum. J. Am. Acad. Child Adolesc.

The article argues that neuroscience facilitates better theory development and empirical testing by considering the physiological context and the role of constructs such as hunger, stress, and social influence on consumer choice and preferences. Neuroscience can also provide new explanations for different sources of heterogeneity within and across populations, suggest novel hypotheses with respect to choices and underlying mechanisms that accord with an understanding of biology, and allow for the use of neural data to make better predictions about consumer behavior. The article suggests that despite some challenges associated with incorporating neuroscience into research on consumer decision processes, the use of neuroscience paradigms will produce a deeper understanding of decision making that can lead to the development of more effective decision aids and interventions.

Motor imagery (MI) ability should be evaluated in selected individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI) who can benefit from MI training in their rehabilitation program. Electrodermal activity seems to be a reliable indicator for assessing MI ability. However, individuals with SCI have a variety of autonomic dysfunctions. Objective. This study aimed to investigate electrodermal responses (EDRs) elicited by MI. Design. A cost-utility analysis of EDR above and below the lesion level in individuals with complete or incomplete SCI (n=30) versus a control group of individuals who were healthy (n=10) was used. Method. The EDR was recorded above and below the lesion level during MI of a drinking action. Duration, latency, and amplitude of EDR were the outcome measures. Results. Hand and foot EDR in the control group occurred with the same pattern and similar latencies, suggesting a common efferent sympathetic pathway to sweat glands of the hand and foot mediating a sympathetic skin response. Individuals with SCI elicited responses above the lesion level. The EDR amplitude was correlated to the lesion level and autonomic dysreflexia history. No foot response was recorded in individuals with complete cervical and thoracic motor lesions. Foot response with a lower amplitude and higher latency occurred in participants with incomplete motor lesion, suggesting a link between the descending motor pathway and sympathetic function. Limitations. The small sample of individuals with incomplete SCI limits the generalization of the results obtained at the foot site. Conclusions. Electrodermal response above the lesion level may be a reliable index for assessing MI ability in individuals with SCI. It is a noninvasive, user-friendly method for clinicians to consider before enrolling individuals in MI training.

The Affective Neuroscience Personality Scales (ANPS) is a self-report questionnaire, based on neuroethological considerations, that could help to assess emotional endophenotypes related to the activity in 6 core cerebral emotional systems (FEAR, ANGER, SADNESS, CARING, PLAYFULNESS, SEEKING). We further investigated its psychometric properties among 830 young adults and showed that they were satisfactory. As participants also completed several other self-reports that shared potential traits with the ANPS, we offer new validity evidence based on relations to other variables. We also provide additional evidence to consider that the ANPS scores can be validly interpreted for the characterization of emotional endophenotypes involved in a variety of psychiatric disorders. On the grounds of present results, of previous clinical studies, as well as some preliminary neuroimaging findings, we discuss new steps in the ANPS validation.

Once chronic pain has developed, pain severity and analgesic response are also highly variable among individuals. Although animal genetics studies have been ongoing for over two decades, only recently have comprehensive human twin studies and large-scale association studies been performed. Here, I review recent and accelerating progress in, and continuing challenges to, the identification of genes contributing to such variability. Success in this endeavor will hopefully lead to both better management of pain using currently available therapies and the development and/or prioritizing of new ones.

The authors prospectively examined white matter fiber tract organization from 6 to 24 months in high-risk infants who developed autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) by 24 months. Method: The participants were 92 high-risk infant siblings from an ongoing imaging study of autism. All participants had diffusion tensor imaging at 6 months and behavioral assessments at 24 months; a majority contributed additional imaging data at 12 and/or 24 months. At 24 months, 28 infants met criteria for ASDs and 64 infants did not. Microstructural properties of white matter fiber tracts reported to be associated with ASDs or related behaviors were characterized by fractional anisotropy and radial and axial diffusivity. Results: The fractional anisotropy trajectories for 12 of 15 fiber tracts differed significantly between the infants who developed ASDs and those who did not. Development for most fiber tracts in the infants with ASDs was characterized by higher fractional anisotropy values at 6 months followed by slower change over time relative to infants without ASDs. Thus, by 24 months of age, those with ASDs had lower values. Conclusions: These results suggest that aberrant development of white matter pathways may precede the manifestation of autistic symptoms in the first year of life. Longitudinal data are critical to characterizing the dynamic age-related brain and behavior changes underlying this neurodevelopmental disorder.

Studies using head circumference suggest that brain enlargement is a postnatal event that occurs around the latter part of the first year. To the authors' knowledge, no previous brain imaging studies have systematically examined the period prior to age 2. In this study they used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to measure brain volume in 6-month-olds at high familial risk for autism. Method: The Infant Brain Imaging Study (IBIS) is a longitudinal imaging study of infants at high risk for autism. This cross-sectional analysis compared brain volumes at 6 months of age in high-risk infants (N=98) and infants without family members with autism (N=36). MRI scans were also examined for radiologic abnormalities. Results: No group differences were observed for intracranial, cerebrum, cerebellum, or lateral ventricle volume or for head circumference. Conclusions: The authors did not observe significant group differences for head circumference, brain volume, or abnormalities in radiologic findings from a group of 6-month-old infants at high risk for autism. The authors are unable to conclude that these abnormalities are not present in infants who later go on to receive a diagnosis of autism; rather, abnormalities were not detected in a large group at high familial risk. Future longitudinal studies of the IBIS study group will examine whether brain volume differs in infants who go on to develop autism.

The objective of this study was to determine if proteasome function is impaired in sporadic ALS. Proteasomal activities and subunit composition were evaluated in homogenates of spinal cord samples obtained at autopsy from sporadic ALS and non-neurological control cases, compared to cerebellum as a clinically spared tissue. The level of 20S alpha structural proteasome subunits was assessed in motor neurons by immunohistochemistry. Catalysis of peptide substrates of the three major proteasomal activities was substantially reduced in ALS thoracic spinal cord, but not in cerebellum, accompanied by alterations in the constitutive proteasome machinery. Chymotrypsin-like activity was decreased to 60% and 65% of control in ventral and dorsal spinal cord, respectively, concomitant with reduction in the beta 5 subunit with this catalytic activity. Caspase- and trypsin-like activities were reduced to a similar extent (46% - 68% of control). Proteasome levels, although generally maintained, appeared reduced specifically in motor neurons by immunolabelling. In conclusion, there are commonalities of findings in sporadic ALS patients and presymptomatic SOD1-G93A transgenic mice and these implicate inadequate proteasome function in the pathogenesis of both familial and sporadic ALS.

Prodromal parkinsonism motor changes in idiopathic REM sleep behaviour disorder	BRAIN			English	Article						Parkinson's disease; REM sleep behaviour disorders	DIAGNOSTIC-TEST BATTERY; DISEASE; PROGRESSION; DEMENTIA; TESTS	Parkinsonism, as a gradually progressive disorder, has a prodromal interval during which neurodegeneration has begun but cardinal manifestations have not fully developed. A systematic direct assessment of this interval has never been performed. Since patients with idiopathic REM sleep behaviour disorder are at very high risk of parkinsonism, they provide a unique opportunity to observe directly the development of parkinsonism. Patients with idiopathic REM sleep behaviour disorder in an ongoing cohort study were evaluated annually with several quantitative motor measures, including the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, Purdue Pegboard, alternate-tap test and timed up-and-go. Patients who developed parkinsonism were identified from this cohort and matched according to age to normal controls. Their results on motor testing from the preceding years were plotted, and then assessed with regression analysis, to determine when markers first deviated from normal values. Sensitivity and specificity of quantitative motor markers for diagnosing prodromal parkinsonism were assessed. Of 78 patients, 20 developed parkinsonism. On regression analysis, the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale first intersected normal values at an estimated 4.5 years before diagnosis. Voice and face akinesia intersected earliest (estimated prodromal interval = 9.8 years), followed by rigidity (4.4 years), gait abnormalities (4.4 years) and limb bradykinesia (4.2 years). Quantitative motor tests intersected normal values at longer prodromal intervals than subjective examination (Purdue Pegboard = 8.6 years, alternate-tap = 8.2, timed up-and-go = 6.3). Using Purdue Pegboard and the alternate-tap test, parkinsonism could be detected with 71-82% sensitivity and specificity 3 years before diagnosis, whereas a Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale score > 4 identified prodromal parkinsonism with 88% sensitivity and 94% specificity 2 years before diagnosis. Removal of action tremor scores improved sensitivity to 94% and specificity to 97% at 2 years before diagnosis (cut-off > 3). Although distinction between conditions was often difficult, prodromal dementia with Lewy bodies appeared to have a slower progression than Parkinson's disease (prodromal interval = 6.0 versus 3.8 years). Using a cut-off of Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale > 3 (excluding action tremor), 25% of patients with 'still-idiopathic' REM sleep behaviour disorder demonstrated evidence of possible prodromal parkinsonism. Therefore, using direct assessment of motor examination before parkinsonism in a REM sleep behaviour disorder, we have estimated a prodromal interval of similar to 4.5 years on the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale; other quantitative markers may detect parkinsonism earlier. Simple quantitative motor measures may be capable of reliably detecting parkinsonism, even before a clinical diagnosis can be made by experienced movement disorders neurologists.	[Postuma, R.

Parental Age Effects on Cortical Morphology in Offspring	CEREBRAL CORTEX			English	Article						cognition; cortex; neuroimaging; neuropsychiatric disorder; parental age	POSTTRAUMATIC-STRESS-DISORDER; AUTOMATED 3-D EXTRACTION; ADVANCING PATERNAL AGE; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; SURFACE-AREA; HUMAN BRAIN; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; EARLY DEPRIVATION; CORPUS-CALLOSUM; MATERNAL AGE	The age at which a parent has a child impacts the child's cognition and risk for mental illness. It appears that this risk is curvilinear, with both age extremes associated with lower intelligence and increased prevalence of some neuropsychiatric disorders. Little is known of the neural mechanisms underpinning this phenomenon. We extracted lobar volumes, surface areas, and cortical thickness from 489 neuroanatomic magnetic resonance images acquired on 171 youth. Using linear mixed model regression, we determined the association between parental age and offspring's neuroanatomy, adjusting for offspring's age, sex, intelligence, and parental socioeconomic class. For gray matter volumes, quadratic paternal and maternal age terms contributed significantly (maternal quadratic age effect: t = -2.2, P = 0.03; paternal quadratic age effect: t = -2.4, P = 0.02) delineating an inverted "U" relationship between parental age and gray matter volume. Cortical volume increased with both advancing paternal and maternal age until around the early 30s after which it fell. Paternal age effects were more pronounced on cortical surface area, whereas maternal age impacted more on cortical thickness.

As important is a more primitive nonlinguistic mode of communication acting in parallel with linguistic processes and driving our decisions to a much higher degree than is generally suspected. Amongst the "honest signals" that influence our behavior is perceived vocal attractiveness. Not only does vocal attractiveness reflect important biological characteristics of the speaker, it also influences our social perceptions according to the "what sounds beautiful is good" phenomenon. Despite the widespread influence of vocal attractiveness on social interactions revealed by behavioral studies, its neural underpinnings are yet unknown. We measured brain activity while participants listened to a series of vocal sounds ("ah") and performed an unrelated task. We found that voice-sensitive auditory and inferior frontal regions were strongly correlated with implicitly perceived vocal attractiveness. While the involvement of auditory areas reflected the processing of acoustic contributors to vocal attractiveness ("distance to mean" and spectrotemporal regularity), activity in inferior prefrontal regions (traditionally involved in speech processes) reflected the overall perceived attractiveness of the voices despite their lack of linguistic content. These results suggest the strong influence of hidden nonlinguistic aspects of communication signals on cerebral activity and provide an objective measure of this influence.	[Bestelmeyer, Patricia E.

However, whether and how these mechanisms affect fronto-striatal activity has never been explored. The purpose of this study was to investigate how aging affects brain patterns during the performance of a lexical analog of the Wisconsin Card Sorting Task, which has been shown to strongly depend on fronto-striatal activity. In the present study, both younger and older individuals revealed significant fronto-striatal loop activity associated with planning and execution of set-shifts, though age-related striatal activity reduction was observed. Most importantly, while the younger group showed the involvement of a "cognitive loop" during the receiving negative feedback period (which indicates that a set-shift will be required to perform the following trial) and the involvement of a "motor loop" during the matching after negative feedback period (when the set-shift must be performed), older participants showed significant activation of both loops during the matching after negative feedback period only. These findings are in agreement with the "load-shift" model postulated by Velanova et al. (Velanova K, Lustig C, Jacoby LL, Buckner RL. 2007. Evidence for frontally mediated controlled processing differences in older adults. Cereb Cortex. 17:1033-1046.) and indicate that the model is not limited to memory retrieval but also applies to executive processes relying on fronto-striatal regions.

AS is a 10-year-old girl who was referred to us by her choir director for persisting difficulties in singing. We tested her with the child version of the Montreal Battery for the Evaluation of Amusia (MBEA) which confirmed AS's severe problems with melodic and rhythmic discrimination and memory for melodies. The disorder appears to be limited to music since her audiometry as well as her intellectual and language skills are normal. Furthermore, the musical disorder is associated to a severe deficit in detecting small pitch changes. The electrical brain responses point to an anomaly in the early stages of auditory processing, such as reflected by an abnormal mismatch negativity (MMN) response to small pitch changes. In singing, AS makes more pitch than time errors. Thus, despite frequent and regular musical practice, AS's profile is similar to the adult form of congenital amusia. (C) 2011 Elsevier Srl.

Attempts to control nematode populations have led to the development of several classes of anthelmintic, which target cys-loop ligand-gated ion channels. Unlike the vertebrate nervous system, the nematode nervous system possesses a large and diversified array of ligand-gated chloride channels that comprise key components of the inhibitory neurotransmission system. In particular, cys-loop GABA receptors have evolved to play many fundamental roles in nematode behaviour such as locomotion. Analysis of the genomes of several free-living and parasitic nematodes suggests that there are several groups of cys-loop GABA receptor subunits that, for the most part, are conserved among nematodes. Despite many similarities with vertebrate cys-loop GABA receptors, those in nematodes are quite distinct in sequence similarity, subunit composition and biological function. With rising anthelmintic resistance in many nematode populations worldwide, GABA receptors should become an area of increased scientific investigation in the development of the next generation of anthelmintics.

Personality was measured at Time 1 while affective states and commitment components were measured at Time 2, while controlling for Time 1 commitment. Extraversion and agreeableness were positively related to affective, normative, and continuance-sacrifices commitments via enhanced positive affect. Agreeableness was also positively linked to affective commitment and negatively associated with continuance-alternatives commitment through reduced negative affect. Finally, neuroticism was negatively linked to affective commitment, and positively related to continuance-alternatives commitment, through increased negative affect. The implications of these findings for our understanding of personality-commitment linkages are discussed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) generates the primary circulatory form of folate required for homocysteine remethylation to methionine. Neurological disturbances have been described in homocystinuria caused by severe MTHFR deficiency. The goal of this study Was to determine if behavioral anomalies are present in severe Mthfr-deficient (Mthfr(-/-)) mice and to identify neurobiological changes that could contribute to these anomalies. Adult male mice of 3 Mthfr genotypes (+/+, +/-, -/-) were tested on motor, anxiety, exploratory and cognitive tasks. Volumes (whole brain and hippocampus) and morphology, global DNA methylation, apoptosis, expression of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) and glucocorticoid receptor (GR), and concentrations of choline metabolites were assessed in hippocampus. Mthfr(-/-) mice had impairments in motor function and in short- and long-term memory, increased exploratory behavior and decreased anxiety. They showed decreased whole brain and hippocampal volumes, reduced thickness of the pyramidal cell layer of CA1 and CA3, and increased apoptosis in hippocampus. There was a disturbance in choline metabolism as manifested by differences in acetylcholine, betaine or glycerophosphocholine concentrations, and by increased ChAT levels. Mthfr(-/-) mice also had increased GR mRNA and protein. Our study has revealed significant anomalies in affective behavior and impairments in memory of Mthfr(-/-) mice. We identified structural changes, increased apoptosis, altered choline metabolism and GR dysregulation in hippocampus. These findings, as well as some similar observations in cerebellum, could contribute to the behavioral changes and suggest that choline is a critical metabolite in homocystinuria.

Moreover, impulsivity is a multi-dimensional construct, and it is plausible that distinct brain networks contribute to its different cognitive, clinical and behavioral aspects. As these networks have not yet been described, we identified distinct cortical and subcortical networks underlying successful inhibitions and inhibition failures in a large sample (n = 1,896) of 14-year-old adolescents. Different networks were associated with drug use (n = 1,593) and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder symptoms (n = 342). Hypofunctioning of a specific orbitofrontal cortical network was associated with likelihood of initiating drug use in early adolescence. Right inferior frontal activity was related to the speed of the inhibition process (n = 826) and use of illegal substances and associated with genetic variation in a norepinephrine transporter gene (n = 819). Our results indicate that both neural endophenotypes and genetic variation give rise to the various manifestations of impulsive behavior.

Unless triggered by pharmacologic agents such as antidepressants, it is generally related to damage of pontomedullary brainstem structures. Idiopathic REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is a well-established risk factor for neurodegenerative disease. Prospective studies have estimated that at least 40-65% of patients with idiopathic RBD will eventually develop a defined neurodegenerative phenotype, almost always a 'synucleinopathy' (Parkinson's disease, Lewy Body dementia or multiple system atrophy). In most cases, patients appear to develop a syndrome with overlapping features of both Parkinson's disease and Lewy body dementia. The interval between RBD onset and disease onset averages 10-15 years, suggesting a promisingly large window for intervention into preclinical disease stages. The ability of RBD to predict disease has major implications for design and development of neuroprotective therapy, and testing of other predictive markers of synuclein-mediated neurodegeneration. Recent studies in idiopathic RBD patients have demonstrated that olfaction, color vision, severity of REM atonia loss, transcranial ultrasound of the substantia nigra, and dopaminergic neuroimaging can predict development of neurodegenerative disease.

Through a large case series, we present our experience of treating cerebral vasospasm with a protocol based on maintenance of homeostasis (correction of electrolyte and glucose disturbances, prevention and treatment of hyperthermia, replacement of fluid losses), and the use of intravenous milrinone to improve microcirculation (the Montreal Neurological Hospital protocol). Our objective is to describe the use milrinone in our practice and the neurological outcomes associated with this approach. Large case series based on the review of all patients diagnosed with delayed ischemic neurologic deficits after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage between April 1999 and April 2006. 88 patients were followed for a mean time of 44.6 months. An intravenous milrinone infusion was used for a mean of 9.8 days without any significant side effects. No medical complications associated with this protocol were observed. There were five deaths; of the surviving patients, 48.9 % were able to go back to their previous baseline and 75 % had a good functional outcome (modified Rankin scale a parts per thousand currency sign2). A protocol using intravenous milrinone, and the maintenance of homeostasis is simple to use and requires less intensive monitoring and resources than the standard triple H therapy. Despite the obvious limitations of this study's design, we believe that it would be now appropriate to proceed with formal prospective studies of this protocol.

Materials and Methods: Meta-Analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology and Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines were used to prepare this article, and the literature was searched with PubMed and with EMBASE and Cochrane databases. Six eligibility criteria (procedural complications rates; at least 10 patients; saccular, nondissecting UAs; original study published in English or French between January 2003 and July 2011; methodological quality score > 6 [modified Strengthening and Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology criteria]; a study published in a peer-reviewed journal) were used. End points included procedural mortality and unfavorable outcomes (death or modified Rankin Scale, Glasgow Outcome Scale, or World Federation of Neurosurgeons Scale at 1 month scores, all > 2). A fixed-effects model (Mantel-Haenszel) was used for pooled estimates of mortality and unfavorable outcomes; a random-effects model (DerSimonian-Laird) was used in case of heterogeneity. Results: Ninety-seven studies with 7172 patients (26 studies published July 2008 through July 2011) were included. Sixty-nine (1.8%) of 7034 patients died (fixed-effect weighted average; 99% confidence interval [CI]: 1.4%, 2.4%; Q value, 55.0; I-2 = 0%). Unfavorable outcomes, including death, occurred in 4.7% (242 of 6941) of patients (99% CI: 3.8, 5.7; Q value, 128.3; I-2 = 26.8%). Patients treated after 2004 had better outcomes (unfavorable outcome, 3.1; 99% CI: 2.4, 4.0) than patients treated during 2001-2003 (unfavorable outcome, 4.7%; 99% CI: 3.6%, 6.1%; P = .01) or in 2000 and before (unfavorable outcome, 5.6%; 99% CI: 4.7%, 6.6%; P < .001). Significantly higher risk was associated with liquid embolic agents (8.1%; 99% CI: 4.7%, 13.7%) versus simple coil placement (4.9%; 99% CI: 3.8%, 6.3%; P = .002). Unfavorable outcomes occurred in 11.5% ( 99% CI: 4.9%, 24.6%) of patients treated with flow diversion. Conclusion: Procedure-related poor outcomes occurred (4.7% of patients), risks decreased, and liquid embolic agents and flow diversion were associated with higher risks.

Fas expression promotes proteasomal activity in toxin-induced parkinsonism. Objective: Fas (CD95), commonly categorised as a death receptor due to its well-defined role in apoptosis, can paradoxically also promote neuroprotection. We have previously found that defects in Fas signalling render mice highly susceptible to neural degeneration in the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine mouse model of Parkinson's disease (PD). Decreased activity of the ubiquitin proteasome system and accumulation of protein aggregates are implicated in PD pathogenesis. Here, we investigate the relationship between Fas and ubiquitin proteasomal activity in neuronal cells. Methods: We performed proteasome assays in neuroblastoma cells and in midbrain cultures of wild-type and Fas-deficient mice. Results: Neuroblastoma cells upregulated proteasomal activity in response to an activating Fas antibody in vitro. Furthermore, neural tissue from Fas-deficient mice showed decreased proteasomal activity compared with the tissue from wild-type mice when exposed to a PD-inducing toxin in vivo. Conclusion: These findings suggest that mechanisms for Fas-mediated neuroprotection may include Fas-induced upregulation of proteasomal activity, and consequently less accumulation of toxic protein aggregates.

The active site of PREP resides in an internal cavity; in addition to the direct interaction between active site and substrate or inhibitor, the pathway to reach the active site (the gating mechanism) must be understood for more rational inhibitor design and understanding PREP function. The gating mechanism of PREP has been investigated through molecular dynamics (MD) simulation combined with crystallographic and mutagenesis studies. The MD results indicate the inter-domain loop structure, comprised of 3 loops at residues, 189-209 (loop A), 577-608 (loop B), and 636-646 (loop C) (porcine PREP numbering), are important components of the gating mechanism. The results from enzyme kinetics of PREP variants also support this hypothesis: When loop A is (1) locked to loop B through a disulphide bridge, all enzyme activity is halted, (2) nicked, enzyme activity is increased, and (3) removed, enzyme activity is only reduced. Limited proteolysis study also supports the hypothesis of a loop A driven gating mechanism. The MD results show a stable network of H-bonds that hold the two protein domains together. Crystallographic study indicates that a set of known PREP inhibitors inhabit a common binding conformation, and this H-bond network is not significantly altered. Thus the domain separation, seen to occur in lower taxa, is not involved in the gating mechanism for mammalian PREP. In two of the MD simulations we observed a conformational change that involved the breaking of the H-bond network holding loops A and B together. We also found that this network was more stable when the active site was occupied, thus decreasing the likelihood of this transition. (C) 2012 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

Methods: Three human reviewers marked interictal spikes on samples of intracranial EEGs from 10 patients. The sensitivity, precision and agreement in channel ranking by activity were calculated between reviewers. A computer algorithm was developed to parallel the way human reviewers detect spikes by first identifying all potential spikes on each channel using frequency filtering and then block scaling all channels at the same time in order to exclude potential spikes that fall below an amplitude and slope threshold. Its performance was compared to the human reviewers on the same set of patients. Results: Human reviewers showed surprisingly poor inter-reviewer agreement, but did broadly agree on the ranking of channels for spike activity. The computer algorithm performed as well as the human reviewers and did especially well at ranking channels from highest to lowest spike frequency. Conclusions: Our algorithm showed good agreement with the different human reviewers, even though they demonstrated different criteria for what constitutes a 'spike' and performed especially well at the clinically important task of ranking channels by spike activity. Significance: An automated, objective method to detect interictal spikes on intracranial recordings will improve both research and the surgical management of epilepsy patients.

Perinatal effects on in vivo measures of human brain serotonin synthesis in adulthood: A 27-year longitudinal study	EUROPEAN NEUROPSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Serotonin; Brain development; Adversity; Stress; Neuro-imaging; Emotion regulation	ORBITOFRONTAL CORTEX; BIRTH-WEIGHT; SMOKING; STRESS; TRANSPORTERS; ADOLESCENCE; BEHAVIOR; SYSTEM; RATS	There is an increasing evidence that prenatal and early postnatal stressors have life long impacts on physical and mental health problems. Animal studies have shown that this could include enduring changes to brain serotonin neurotransmission. In the present study, we tested whether perinatal adversity in humans has a long-term impact on brain serotonin neurotransmission in adulthood. Twenty-six healthy males, recruited from a 27-year longitudinal study, underwent a positron emission tomography scan with the tracer alpha-[C-11]methyl-L-tryptophan (C-11-AMT), as an index of serotonin synthesis capacity. The trapping constant is taken as a proxy for the regional 5-HT synthesis. Birth complications, especially a delivery where the fetus showed signs of physiological distress, predicted lower C-11-AMT trapping in the hippocampus and medial orbitofrontal cortex. Lower C-11-AMT trapping in the medial orbitofrontal cortex was also predicted by maternal smoking and lower birth weight. There were no effects of childhood or recent adversity. This is the first human study reporting associations between perinatal adversity and adult C-11-AMT trapping in the hippocampus and medial orbitofrontal cortex. The associations suggest that limbic serotonin pathways may be particularly vulnerable to environmental challenges during the period when they undergo the most prominent neurodevelopmental changes. In combination with other risk factors, perinatal stressors may contribute to increased vulnerability for psychiatric disorders in which serotonin plays a major role. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. and ECNP.

CD133 expression is an independent prognostic marker for a low survival rate in several cancers. The aim of this study was to determine the prognostic value of CD133 expression in a large cohort of neuroblastoma cases, to define the chemoresistance of neuroblastoma cells expressing CD133, and to determine whether this chemoresistance is regulated by activation of the AKT pathway. Methods and results: Two hundred and eighty samples of neuroblastoma were screened for CD133 expression. The sensitivity of purified CD133+ neuroblastoma cells isolated from two human cell lines to doxorubicin, vincristine and cisplatin, as single agents or in combination with LY294002, an AKT inhibitor, was evaluated in vitro. CD133 expression was found in 100 of 280 tumours. There was a significant association between CD133 expression and the following poor prognosis covariates: age, International Neuroblastoma Staging System stage, MYCN amplification, and phospho-AKT (pAKT) expression. Patients with CD133- tumours had significantly better 3-year event-free and overall survival than patients with CD133+ tumours. In a multivariate model, CD133 expression was independently associated with decreased overall survival. CD133high neuroblastoma cells were significantly resistant to chemotherapy as compared with CD133low cells. Treatment of unsorted neuroblastoma cells with the three anticancer drugs significantly enriched the CD133+ subpopulation. CD133high cells expressed significantly higher levels of pAKT than CD133low cells. LY294002 treatment abolished the preferential survival of CD133high cells. Conclusions: CD133 is associated with in-vitro resistance to chemotherapy involving activation of the AKT pathway.

Optimal surgical management of severe ischemic mitral regurgitation: To repair or to replace?	JOURNAL OF THORACIC AND CARDIOVASCULAR SURGERY			English	Article							VALVULAR HEART-DISEASE; PAPILLARY-MUSCLE; NORMATIVE DATA; VALVE REPAIR; ANNULOPLASTY; RELIABILITY; DYSFUNCTION	Background: Ischemic mitral regurgitation, a complication of myocardial infarction and coronary artery disease more generally, is associated with a high mortality rate and is estimated to affect 2.8 million Americans. With 1-year mortality rates as high as 40%, recent practice guidelines of professional societies recommend repair or replacement, but there remains a lack of conclusive evidence supporting either intervention. The choice between therapeutic options is characterized by the trade-off between reduced operative morbidity and mortality with repair versus a better long-term correction of mitral insufficiency with replacement. The long-term benefits of repair versus replacement remain unknown, which has led to significant variation in surgical practice. Methods and Results: This article describes the design of a prospective randomized clinical trial to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of mitral valve repair and replacement in patients with severe ischemic mitral regurgitation. This trial is being conducted as part of the Cardiothoracic Surgical Trials Network. This article addresses challenges in selecting a feasible primary end point, characterizing the target population (including the degree of mitral regurgitation) and analytical challenges in this high mortality disease. Conclusions: The article concludes by discussing the importance of information on functional status, survival, neurocognition, quality of life, and cardiac physiology in therapeutic decision making.

This procedure requires precise placement of the stimulating electrode. Common practice of DBS implantation utilizes microelectrode recording to locate the sites with the correct electrical response after an initial location estimate based on a universal human brain atlas that is linearly scaled to the patient's anatomy as seen on the preoperative images. However, this often results in prolonged surgical time and possible surgical complications since the small-sized STN is difficult to visualize on conventional magnetic resonance (MR) images and its intersubject variability is not sufficiently considered in the atlas customization. This paper proposes a multicontrast, multiecho MR imaging (MRI) method that directly delineates the STN and other basal ganglia structures through five co-registered image contrasts (T1-weighted navigation image, R2* map, susceptibility-weighted imaging (phase, magnitude and fusion image)) obtained within a clinically acceptable time. The image protocol was optimized through both simulation and in vivo experiments to obtain the best image quality. Taking advantage of the multiple echoes and high readout bandwidths, no interimage registration is required since all images are produced in one acquisition, and image distortion and chemical shift are reduced. This MRI protocol is expected to mitigate some of the shortcomings of the state-of-the-art DBS implantation methods. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Four healthy adult volunteers were imaged on a clinical 3-T system using a protocol comprising two different three-dimensional susceptibility-weighted gradient-echo sequences: a standard single-echo sequence and a multiecho sequence. Both sequences were repeated twice in order to evaluate the local noise contribution by a subtraction of the two acquisitions. For the multiecho sequence, the phase information from each echo was independently unwrapped, and the background field contribution was removed using either homodyne filtering or the projection onto dipole fields method. The phase information from all echoes was then combined using a weighted linear regression. R2* maps were also calculated from the multiecho acquisitions. The noise standard deviation in the reconstructed phase images was evaluated for six manually segmented regions of interest (frontal white matter, posterior white matter, globus pallidus, putamen, caudate nucleus and lateral ventricle). The use of the multiecho sequence for susceptibility-weighted phase imaging led to a reduction of the noise standard deviation for all subjects and all regions of interest investigated in comparison to the reference single-echo acquisition. On average, the noise reduction ranged from 18.4% for the globus pallidus to 47.9% for the lateral ventricle. In addition, the amount of noise reduction was found to be strongly inversely correlated to the estimated R2* value (R=-0.92). In conclusion, the use of a multiecho sequence is an effective way to decrease the noise contribution in susceptibility-weighted phase images, while preserving both contrast and acquisition time. The proposed approach additionally permits the calculation of R2* maps. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Lumbar intervertebral disc degeneration associated with axial and radiating low back pain in ageing SPARC-null mice	PAIN			English	Article						Animal model; Axial low back pain; Degenerative disc disease; Physical function; Radiating low back pain	DORSAL-ROOT GANGLION; SENSORY NERVE-FIBERS; VERTEBRAL END-PLATE; NUCLEUS PULPOSUS; NEUROPATHIC PAIN; GROWTH-FACTOR; CENTRAL SENSITIZATION; AFFERENT-FIBERS; ANIMAL-MODELS; IX COLLAGEN	Chronic low back pain (LBP) is a complex, multifactorial disorder with unclear underlying mechanisms. In humans and rodents, decreased expression of secreted protein acidic rich in cysteine (SPARC) is associated with intervertebral disc (IVD) degeneration and signs of LBP. The current study investigates the hypothesis that IVD degeneration is a risk factor for chronic LBP. SPARC-null and age-matched control mice ranging from 6 to 78 weeks of age were evaluated in this study. X-ray and histologic analysis revealed reduced IVD height, increased wedging, and signs of degeneration (bulging and herniation). Cutaneous sensitivity to cold, heat, and mechanical stimuli were used as measures of referred (low back and tail) and radiating pain (hind paw). Region specificity was assessed by measuring icilin- and capsaicin-evoked behaviour after subcutaneous injection into the hind paw or upper lip. Axial discomfort was measured by the tail suspension and grip force assays. Motor impairment was determined by the accelerating rotarod. Physical function was evaluated by voluntary activity after axial strain or during ambulation with forced lateral flexion. SPARC-null mice developed (1) region-specific, age-dependent hypersensitivity to cold, icilin, and capsaicin (hind paw only), (2) axial discomfort, (3) motor impairment, and (4) reduced physical function. Morphine (6 mg/kg, i.p.) reduced cutaneous sensitivity and alleviated axial discomfort in SPARC-null mice. Ageing SPARC-null mice mirror many aspects of the complex and challenging nature of LBP in humans and incorporate both anatomic and functional components of the disease. The current study supports the hypothesis that IVD degeneration is a risk factor for chronic LBP. (C) 2012 International Association for the Study of Pain. Published by Elsevier B. V.

Most nociceptive primary afferents are unmyelinated (C fibers) and subdivided into peptidergic and nonpeptidergic fibers. Previous studies have found nerve injury in the trigeminal system to induce changes in small-diameter primary afferent innervation and cause significant autonomic sprouting into the upper dermis of the lower-lip skin of the rat. In this study, we used the ribosomal toxin, saporin, conjugated to the lectin IB4 to specifically ablate the nonpeptidergic nociceptive C fibers, to see if loss of these fibers was enough to induce autonomic fiber sprouting. IB4-saporin treatment led to specific and permanent ablation of the IB4-positive, P2X(3)-immunoreactive fibers and led to sprouting of parasympathetic fibers into the upper dermis, but not of sympathetic fibers. These changes were associated with significant increase in glial-derived nerve growth factor levels in the lower-lip skin. While IB4-saporin treatment had no effect on evoked mechanical thresholds when von Frey hairs were applied to the lower-lip skin, ablation of nonpeptidergic fibers in a chronic constriction injury model caused significant sympathetic and parasympathetic fiber sprouting, and led to an exacerbated pain response. This was an unexpected finding, as it has been suggested that nonpeptidergic fibers play a major role in mechanical pain, and suggests that these fibers play a complex role in the development of neuropathic pain.

A prevailing interpretation is that these associations result from heuristic cognitive processing of cues from the face to yield a judgment about the candidate, processing that is shared by both voters and experimental participants. Here, we report findings suggesting that nonfacial aspects of a candidate's appearance are important cues for voter decision making. We asked participants to look at pairs of candidate images and decide (a) whom to vote for (SimVote), (b) who looks more physically threatening (Threat), and (c) who looks more competent to hold congressional office (Competence). When participants saw only the candidates' faces, there was no association between their decisions and electoral outcomes, except for Threat. Yet when participants saw the candidate images with the faces removed, there was a strong association between their decisions and voters' decisions, for all decision types. This suggests that the appearance-related heuristics that some voters use to guide their decisions may include mental schemas for processing appearance cues other than those associated with facial features. Such schema-based processing has implications for understanding the neurobiological system underlying thin-slice decisions from appearance alone.

We retrospectively reviewed the radiological and clinical files of 19 patients (age range: 12-75; mean: 47) who presented with acute or chronic subperiosteal iliac hematomas. Imaging findings and relevant clinical information were recorded. A thorough literature search was performed to find additional cases of this rare condition. Three young patients presented with acute subperiosteal iliac hematoma following a fall. Clinical presentation was characterized by pain and gait disturbance presumed to result from crural nerve compression. Unilateral or bilateral lenticular hematomas deep in the iliacus muscle were demonstrated by CT for all patients while MRI was also available for two of them. In 16 asymptomatic patients, chronic ossified subperiosteal iliac hematomas were incidentally detected by CT. Progressive ossification of acute hematoma was demonstrated at follow-up in two patients. Subperiosteal iliac hematoma is rare but has typical imaging findings that may present acutely in adolescents or chronically in asymptomatic adults.

Because time and resources for ethical and safety review are limited, how investigators, IRBs, and regulators allocate attention to a trial's various safety dimensions itself represents a critical ethical question. In what follows, I use the example of a Parkinson's disease gene transfer trial to show how risks involving unknown probabilities or outcomes (ambiguity), might sometimes draw attention away from risks that involve known probabilities or outcomes. This potentially undermines the goal of systematic and nonarbitrary analysis of risk during ethical review. To counteract the possible effects of such attention biases, I propose that reviewers develop cognitive aids like lists and, where appropriate, set aside time to discuss non-ambiguous risks. I also propose further research for addressing and understanding how attention allocation, emotion, and ambiguity influence ethical decision-making.

J	Zaccara, G; Perucca, P; Gangemi, PF				Zaccara, Gaetano; Perucca, Piero; Gangemi, Pier Franco			The adverse event profile of pregabalin across different disorders: a meta-analysis	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Epilepsy; Antiepileptic drugs; Pregabalin; Adverse effects; Nocebo effect; Meta-analysis	PLACEBO-CONTROLLED TRIAL; GENERALIZED ANXIETY DISORDER; ADD-ON TREATMENT; DOUBLE-BLIND; ANTIEPILEPTIC DRUGS; PARTIAL SEIZURES; POSTHERPETIC NEURALGIA; DIABETIC-NEUROPATHY; DOSE-RESPONSE; EFFICACY	In a recent meta-analysis of 38 double-blind randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing pregabalin (PGB) to placebo, we found 20 adverse events (AEs) to be significantly associated with PGB treatment. In the present study, we evaluated whether the incidence of these 20 AEs differs across distinct disorders in which PGB was investigated. Among the 38 previously identified RCTs of PGB, we selected only those including a PGB 600 mg/day arm and subsequently classified them into four distinct groups according to the disorder in which PGB was investigated: (1) drug-resistant partial epilepsy, (2) psychiatric disorders, (3) fibromyalgia, and (4) neuropathic pain. We used risk differences (RDs) to quantify the placebo-corrected proportion of subjects discontinuing PGB due to intolerable AEs and to determine the placebo-corrected incidence of each of the 20 PGB AEs across the four disorders. Twenty-two RCTs were included in this study. Neither the proportion of subjects discontinuing PGB due to intolerable AEs nor the incidence of PGB AEs (with the exception of ataxia) differed significantly across the four disorders. Ataxia was more common in drug-resistant partial epilepsy compared to fibromyalgia. When limiting analyses to subjects on placebo, most vestibulo-cerebellar AEs (ataxia, diplopia, and blurred vision) were found to be more common in drug-resistant partial epilepsy compared to all other disorders. Diplopia and blurred vision were more common in epilepsy than in neuropathic pain; and ataxia had a higher incidence in epilepsy than in anxiety disorder and fibromyalgia. Among other CNS AEs, somnolence was more common in epilepsy compared to neuropathic pain and in anxiety disorders alone compared to neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia. Asthenia was also more common in epilepsy than in neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia. Although drug-resistant partial epilepsy is associated with a higher probability of developing vestibulo-cerebellar AEs, the risk for PGB toxicity does not differ across distinct disorders.

Caused by direct physical damage or diseases of the nervous system responsible for pain generation and transmission, NeP is manifested as spontaneous pain, hyperalgesia and allodynia. Its treatment is a challenging and unmet medical need. It is generally accepted that inflammatory mediators over-produced in injured nerves play a crucial role in the initiation and maintenance of NeP. Areas covered: Among numerous inflammatory mediators, cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2) and its end product prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) are persistently up-regulated in infiltrating macrophages and Schwann cells in injured nerves and contribute to the development of NeP. In a NeP rat model and an ex vivo model of sensory ganglion explant culture, injured nerve-derived COX2 and PGE2 facilitate the synthesis of pain mediators including neuropeptides, ion channels, cytokines and neurotrophins in primary sensory neurons. Expert Opinion: Stimulating the synthesis of pain mediators in primary sensory neurons is a novel mechanism underlying the contribution of injured nerve-derived COX2 and PGE2 to the genesis of NeP. Targeting COX2/PGE2/EP signaling in injured nerves through local administration could open a novel therapeutic avenue to treat this debilitating disease.

The activation of the quantron is determined by the maximum of a sum of input signals, which is difficult to use in classical learning algorithms. Thus, training the quantron to solve classification problems requires heuristic methods such as direct search. In this paper, we present an approximation of the quantron trainable by gradient search. We show this approximation improves the classification performance of direct search solutions. We also compare the quantron and the perceptron's performance in solving the IRIS classification problem.

Ordering of neuronal apoptosis signaling: a superoxide burst precedes mitochondrial cytochrome c release in a growth factor deprivation model	APOPTOSIS			English	Article						Superoxide anion; Apoptosis signaling; Retinal ganglion cells; Growth factor deprivation	RETINAL GANGLION-CELLS; SERUM DEPRIVATION; OXIDATIVE STRESS; DEATH; ANION; DIFFERENTIATION; PEROXIDE; SURVIVAL; INCREASE; INJURY	Axonal injury to retinal ganglion cells, a defined central neuron, induces a burst of intracellular superoxide anion that precedes externalization of membrane phosphatidylserine and subsequent apoptotic cell death. Dismutation of superoxide prevents the signal and delays loss of these cells, consistent with superoxide being necessary for transduction of the axotomy signal. However, phosphatidylserine externalization is a relatively late step in apoptosis, and it is possible that the superoxide burst is not an early axotomy signal but rather a result of cytochrome release from the mitochondrial inner membrane with consequent accumulation of reduced intermediates. Other possibilities are that both superoxide generation and cytochrome release are induced in parallel by axotomy, or that cytochrome release potentiates the effect of the superoxide burst. To distinguish these various possibilities, serum-deprived neuronal retinal cells were assayed in vitro for superoxide elevation and release of cytochrome from mitochondria, and the distribution of these two markers across a large number of cells used to model the temporal ordering of events. Based on this model of factor-dependent cell death, superoxide precedes, and possibly potentiates, cytochrome release, and thus the former is likely an early signal for certain types of neuronal apoptosis in the central nervous system.

In the present study, we hypothesized that dysphoria in depressed individuals similarly modulates this adaptation, possibly through a neural mechanism involving serotonergic regulation. We tested the effect of dysphoria induced by acute tryptophan depletion (ATD) in remitted depressed patients on conflict adaptation in a Simon task. ATD temporarily lowers the availability of the serotonin precursor L-Tryptophan and is known to increase depressive symptoms in approximately half of remitted depressed participants. We found that depressive symptoms induced by ATD were associated with increased conflict adaptation. Our finding extends recent observations implying an important role of affect in regulating conflict-driven cognitive control.	[van Steenbergen, Henk; van der Does, A. J.

This is exemplified by the approximately 1000 cases reported in mainly retrospective series. These cases fall into four paradigms: adjuvant radiosurgery as an alternative to whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT), radiosurgery neoadjuvant to the surgical resection, radiosurgery as an intensification of adjuvant WBRT, and adjuvant radiosurgery for patients having failed prior WBRT. These procedures seem well tolerated, with an approximate 5% risk of radiation necrosis. Although crude local control rates for each strategy seem improved over surgery alone, multiple biases make comparisons with standard WBRT difficult without prospective data. Because evidence lags behind clinical practice, an upcoming intergroup trial will aim to clarify the value of the most common tumor bed radiosurgery strategy by randomizing oligometastatic patients between adjuvant WBRT and adjuvant radiosurgery.

The mechanisms underlying this are not known but animal studies suggest prenatal stress may alter the function of the placenta. Here we determined whether maternal prenatal anxiety was associated with a downregulation of placental 11 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (11 beta-HSD2), the enzyme which metabolises cortisol. Methods: We recruited mothers the day before delivery by elective caesarean, and gave them the Spielberger Trait and State anxiety and Edinburgh Depression self-rating scales. Placentae were collected and aliquots stored for later analysis. Results: Prenatal Trait anxiety was negatively correlated with placental 11 beta-HSD2 mRNA expression (r = -0.40, p < 0.01, n = 56). Results were similar with male and female fetuses (r = -0.39, p = 0.04, n = 28; r = -0.40, p = 0.03, n = 28) respectively. Results were also significant with State anxiety (r = -0.27, p = 0.05, n = 56) but somewhat weaker for depression (r = -0.20, p = 0.13, n = 56). Preliminary analyses on a subset of cases (n = 25) suggested parallel results for enzyme activity. Conclusions: These findings provide evidence for an association between prenatal maternal mood and downregulation of placental 11 beta-HSD2. Results are consistent with raised maternal anxiety being associated with increased fetal exposure to maternal cortisol, and support the hypothesis that this may be one mechanism underlying fetal programming by prenatal stress.

The beneficial effect of intradetrusor botulinum toxin (BT) injections on hyperactive bladders in individuals with spinal cord injury is known from the literature, but its potential effect on ejaculation and fertility through diffusion is not. As BT injection paralyses the bladder muscle, it may also paralyse the muscular envelopes of the adjacent reproductive organs and lead to potential negative side effects, which have not been studied yet. This study provides preliminary data on the potential negative side effects of BT injections on semen volume and retrograde ejaculation, as well as some potential beneficial effects on semen quality. OBJECTIVE To investigate the effect of botulinum neurotoxin A on ejaculation potential and fertility. Intradetrusor injection of botulinum neurotoxin A is most commonly used nowadays to treat overactive bladder in patients with spinal cord injury (SCI). PATIENTS AND METHODS Retrospective analyses were carried out of 11 patients with complete lesions from C5 to T6 who had received botulinum (BT) injections for their overactive bladder and who had undergone ejaculation tests before and after BT treatment. RESULTS BT treatment was found effective in improving bladder function in up to 85% of the cases. While no patients maintained natural ejaculation following their SCI, BT treatment was found to increase the incidence of retrograde ejaculation (vibrostimulation) in 46% of cases and to diminish semen volume in 77% of cases, from an average of 1.8 mL to 1 mL. Semen quality was slightly improved following BT treatment, sperm mobility increased in 67% of cases, sperm vitality in 50% and semen culture improved in 43%. CONCLUSIONS BT treatment has beneficial and detrimental effects on ejaculation function. The detrimental effects involve retrograde ejaculation and reduced semen volume, which are explained by the spread of toxin to the bladder neck, reducing its tonus, and to the smooth muscle sexual accessory organs, reducing the strength of their contraction. The beneficial effects are explained by the reduced contamination of the semen by urinary infection, which may improve spermatogenesis and subsequent semen quality. The results are discussed in terms of their clinical implications and advice to patients.

Ten participants were shown lyrics of familiar verbal tunes; they either heard the tune along with the lyrics, or they had to imagine it. In a subsequent surprise recognition test, they had to identify the titles of tunes that they had heard or imagined earlier. The functional data showed substantial overlap during melody perception and imagery, including secondary auditory areas. During imagery compared with perception, an extended network including pFC, SMA, intraparietal sulcus, and cerebellum showed increased activity, in line with the increased processing demands of imagery. Functional connectivity of anterior right temporal cortex with frontal areas was increased during imagery compared with perception, indicating that these areas form an imagery-related network. Activity in right superior temporal gyrus and pFC was correlated with the subjective rating of imagery vividness. Similar to the encoding phase, the recognition task recruited overlapping areas, including inferior frontal cortex associated with memory retrieval, as well as left middle temporal gyrus. The results present new evidence for the cortical network underlying goal-directed auditory imagery, with a prominent role of the right pFC both for the subjective impression of imagery vividness and for on-line mental monitoring of imagery-related activity in auditory areas.

J	Sotero, RC; Shmuel, A				Sotero, Roberto C.; Shmuel, Amir			Energy-based stochastic control of neural mass models suggests time-varying effective connectivity in the resting state	JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Neural mass models; Stochastic LQR; Energy consumption; Time-varying parameters model; Effective connectivity; Connectivity matrix	BAYESIAN DECISION-THEORY; INFORMATION-TRANSMISSION; BIFURCATION-ANALYSIS; VISUAL-PERCEPTION; NEURONAL-ACTIVITY; METABOLIC COST; BRAIN; PRINCIPLE; EVOLUTION; COMPUTATION	Several studies posit energy as a constraint on the coding and processing of information in the brain due to the high cost of resting and evoked cortical activity. This suggestion has been addressed theoretically with models of a single neuron and two coupled neurons. Neural mass models (NMMs) address mean-field based modeling of the activity and interactions between populations of neurons rather than a few neurons. NMMs have been widely employed for studying the generation of EEG rhythms, and more recently as frameworks for integrated models of neurophysiology and functional MRI (fMRI) responses. To date, the consequences of energy constraints on the activity and interactions of ensembles of neurons have not been addressed. Here we aim to study the impact of constraining energy consumption during the resting-state on NMM parameters. To this end, we first linearized the model, then used stochastic control theory by introducing a quadratic cost function, which transforms the NMM into a stochastic linear quadratic regulator (LQR). Solving the LQR problem introduces a regime in which the NMM parameters, specifically the effective connectivities between neuronal populations, must vary with time. This is in contrast to current NMMs, which assume a constant parameter set for a given condition or task. We further simulated energy-constrained stochastic control of a specific NMM, the Wilson and Cowan model of two coupled neuronal populations, one of which is excitatory and the other inhibitory. These simulations demonstrate that with varying weights of the energy-cost function, the NMM parameters show different time-varying behavior. We conclude that constraining NMMs according to energy consumption may create more realistic models. We further propose to employ linear NMMs with time-varying parameters as an alternative to traditional nonlinear NMMs with constant parameters.

We also review aspects of our NGF investigations which have recently led to the discovery that NGF is released in an activity-dependent manner in the form of its precursor molecule, proNGF. These studies support the notion that in the CNS NGF metabolism conversion and degradation occur in the extracellular milieu. We have also validated this pathway in vivo demonstrating that the pharmacological inhibition of the pro-to mature NGF conversion results in the brain accumulation of proNGF and loss and atrophy of cortical cholinergic synapses. Furthermore, we have gathered neurochemical evidence for a compromise of this newly discovered NGF metabolic pathway in Alzheimer's disease, explaining the vulnerability of NGF-dependent forebrain cholinergic neurons in this disease despite normal NGF synthesis and abundance of NGF precursor.

Neonatal exposure to phenobarbital potentiates schizophrenia-like behavioral outcomes in the rat	NEUROPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Phenobarbital; Neonatal brain; Rat model; Schizophrenia; Adult behavior; Antiepileptic drug; Neuronal apoptosis; Prepulse inhibition; Amphetamine-induced locomotion	EXCITOTOXIC HIPPOCAMPAL DAMAGE; PREPULSE INHIBITION DEFICITS; SENSORIMOTOR GATING DEFICITS; ANTIEPILEPTIC DRUG EXPOSURE; LONG-TERM REDUCTION; STARTLE REFLEX; APOPTOTIC NEURODEGENERATION; ANIMAL-MODEL; CELL-DEATH; NEURODEVELOPMENTAL MODEL	Previous work has indicated an association between seizures early in life and increased risk of psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia. However, because early-life seizures are commonly treated with antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) such as phenobarbital, the possibility that drug treatment may affect later-life psychiatric outcomes needs to be evaluated. We therefore tested the hypothesis that phenobarbital exposure in the neonatal rat increases the risk of schizophrenia-like behavioral abnormalities in adulthood. Thus, in this study, we examined the effects of a single acute neonatal exposure to phenobarbital on adult behavioral outcomes in the rat neonatal ventral hippocampal (nVH) lesion model of schizophrenia. We compared these outcomes to those in rats a) without nVH lesions and b) with nVH lesions, without phenobarbital. The tasks used for behavioral evaluation were: amphetamine-induced locomotion, prepulse inhibition, elevated plus-maze, and novel object recognition task. We found that neonatal phenobarbital treatment (in the absence of nVH lesions) was sufficient to disrupt sensorimotor gating (as tested by prepulse inhibition) in adulthood to an extent equivalent to nVH lesions. Additionally, neonatal phenobarbital exposure enhanced the locomotor response to amphetamine in adult animals with and without nVH lesions. Our findings suggest that neonatal exposure to phenobarbital can predispose to schizophrenia-like behavioral abnormalities. Our findings underscore the importance of examining AED exposure early in life as a potential risk factor for later-life neuropsychiatric abnormalities in clinical populations. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Connolly, JF; Granger, E; Sabourin, R				Connolly, Jean-Francois; Granger, Eric; Sabourin, Robert			An adaptive classification system for video-based face recognition	INFORMATION SCIENCES			English	Article						Incremental learning; ARTMAP neural networks; Dynamic particle swarm optimization; Pattern recognition; Face recognition; Image/video processing	NEURAL-NETWORK; CONCEPT DRIFT; ARCHITECTURE; ARTMAP	In many practical applications, new information may emerge from the environment at different points in time after a classification system has originally been deployed. For instance, in biometric systems, new data may be acquired and used to enroll or to update knowledge of an individual. In this paper, an adaptive classification system (ACS) is proposed for video-based face recognition. It combines a fuzzy ARTMAP neural network classifier, dynamic particle swarm optimization (DPSO) algorithm, and a long term memory (LTM). A novel DPSO-based learning strategy is also presented for incremental learning of new data with this ACS. This strategy allows to cojointly optimize the classifier weights, architecture, and user-defined hyperparameters such as classification rate is maximized. Performance of this system is assessed in terms of classification rate and resource requirements for incremental learning of data blocks coming from real-world video data bases. The necessity of a LTM to store validation data is shown empirically for different enrollment and update scenarios. In addition, incremental learning is shown to constitute a dynamic optimization problem where the optimal hyperparameter values change in time. Simulation results indicate that the proposed system can provide a significant higher classification rate than that of fuzzy ARTMAP alone during incremental learning. However, optimization of ACS parameters requires more resources. The ACS needs several training sequences to produce the optimal solution, and adapting fuzzy ARTMAP parameters according to classification rate tends to require more category neurons and training epochs.

In vitro biocompatibility assessment of functionalized magnetite nanoparticles: Biological and cytotoxicological effects	JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL MATERIALS RESEARCH PART A			English	Review						biocompatibility; cell viability; cytotoxicological effects; functionalized magnetite nanoparticles	IRON-OXIDE NANOPARTICLES; CELLULAR UPTAKE; CYTOTOXICITY; NANOTECHNOLOGY; CELLS; SIZE; MRI; OPPORTUNITIES; NEUROSCIENCE; SILICA	In the biomedical field, nanomaterials have the potential for use in the targeted delivery of drugs in the human body and in the diagnosis and therapy of certain diseases. In the category of targeted delivery, magnetite (Fe3O4) nanoparticles have received much attention. As with any similar new therapy, when such nanoparticles are functionalized with chemical groups designed to permit the specific attachment of drugs, cytotoxicological testing is necessary before moving to animal models. Here, we consider several variously functionalized magnetite nanoparticles, including those prepared with (1) a monolayer of oleic acid (Fe3O4@OA), which is subsequently converted to (2) a shell of amine-containing silane (Fe3O4@NH2), (3) a shell of silica (Fe3O4@SiO2), and (4) a shell of amine-containing silane over a shell of silica (Fe3O4@SiO2@NH2). These latter three functionalities were evaluated for biocompatibility, cellular morphology, mitochondrial function (MTT assay), lactate dehydrogenase membrane leakage (LDH assay), and proinflammatory potential through enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for interleukin 6 (IL-6). Controlled tests were performed over a period of 72 h, with results showing LDH leakage and abnormal Il-6 secretion at high concentrations (>50 mu g/mL). The tests showed that, in addition to the surface characteristics of the nanoparticles, both the nutrient medium and the time of suspension before exposure to cells also contribute to nanoparticle cytotoxicity.

The prevalence of behavioral problems was assessed in a longitudinal study in pediatric patients with an acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Multilevel modeling was used to identify associated predictive factors. Procedure. ALL patients and their parents (n 138) took part to this study. Patients were treated according to the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI) consortium protocols 91-01 or 95-01. Mothers filled out questionnaires providing a measure of behavioral problems for their child at diagnosis and during the subsequent 4 years, and of their perceived familial stress at diagnosis and post-induction. Results. Prevalence of internalized behavioral problems at diagnosis was increased [42% above 1 standard deviation (SD); P < 0.001], but it normalized over time. Internalized problems resolved more slowly in the presence of medical variables associated with increased stress related to the disease (hospitalization duration, P < 0.001; relapse risk at diagnosis, P < 0.001). Externalized behavioral problems were within the expected normal range, but more sustained over time with the 95-01 than with the 91-01 treatment protocols (P < 0.05), likely due to the type of corticosteroid (CS) used (dexamethasone vs. prednisone). Conclusions. Assessment of both internalized and externalized problems is required in this population. The impact of pharmacological variables on externalized behavioral problems is likely related to CS use. Pediatr Blood Cancer 2012; 58: 971-977. (C) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Seven rats underwent dynamic PET scans (60 min) after bolus injection of [11C]ABP688. Kinetic analyses included: binding potential (BPND) determined by calculating (a) the simplified reference tissue model (SRTM) and (b) its two-steps simplified version (SRTM2); (c) multilinear reference tissue model (MRTM) and (d) its 2-parameter version (MRTM2); (e) noninvasive graphical analysis (NIGA). Parametric images were generated representing BPND by the MRTM2 model. BPND determinations were reproducible with low to acceptable variability ranging from 5 to 10% and reproducibility scores (intraclass correlation coefficient) between 0.51 and 0.88. The pharmacokinetic model that showed lowest overall variability was the SRTM. In contrast, the use of the NIGA was associated with significantly lower reproducibility scores. Comparison of parametric images revealed no significant bias between test and retest measurements and is therefore suitable to compare groups at voxel levels. In conclusion, our results suggest that noninvasive quantification of [11C]ABP688 imaging is reproducible and reliable for PET studies of the cerebral mGluR5 in rats. Synapse, 2012.

J	Li, GX; Baker, CL				Li, Guangxing; Baker, Curtis L., Jr.			Functional Organization of Envelope-Responsive Neurons in Early Visual Cortex: Organization of Carrier Tuning Properties	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							CAT STRIATE CORTEX; MACAQUE AREA MT; COLUMNAR ORGANIZATION; RECEPTIVE FIELDS; ORIENTATION MAPS; SPIKING ACTIVITY; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; CORTICAL MAPS; CONTRAST; V1	It is well established that visual cortex neurons having similar selectivity for orientation, direction of motion, ocular dominance, and other properties of first-order (luminance-defined) stimuli are clustered into a columnar organization. However, the cortical architecture of neuronal responses to second-order (contrast/texture-defined) stimuli is poorly understood. A useful second-order stimulus is a contrast envelope, consisting of a finely detailed pattern (carrier) whose contrast varies on a coarse spatial scale (envelope). In this study, we analyzed the cortical organization of carrier tuning properties of neurons, which responded to contrast-modulated stimuli. We examined whether neurons tuned to similar carrier properties are clustered spatially and whether such spatial clusters are arranged in columns. To address these questions, we recorded single-unit activity, multiunit activity, and local field potentials simultaneously from area 18 of anesthetized cats, using single-channel microelectrodes and multielectrode arrays. Our data showed that neurons tuned to similar carrier spatial frequency are distributed in a highly clustered manner; neurons tuned to similar carrier orientation are also significantly clustered. Neurons along linear arrays perpendicular to the brain surface always exhibited similar optimal carrier spatial frequency, indicating a columnar organization. Multi-pronged tetrode recordings indicated that the diameter of these columns is >= 450 mu m. Optimal carrier orientation was also significantly clustered but with finer-grain organization and greater scatter. These results indicate a fine anatomical structure of cortical organization of second-order information processing and suggest that there are probably more maps in cat area 18 than previously believed.

J	Legault, I; Faubert, J				Legault, Isabelle; Faubert, Jocelyn			Perceptual-cognitive training improves biological motion perception: evidence for transferability of training in healthy aging	NEUROREPORT			English	Article						aging; biological motion; perceptual-cognitive training; three-dimensional multiple object tracking speed task; transferability	MINI-MENTAL-STATE; OLDER-ADULTS; RECOGNITION; GENDER	In our everyday life, processing complex dynamic scenes such as crowds and traffic is of critical importance. Further, it is well documented that there is an age-related decline in complex perceptual-cognitive processing, which can be reversed with training. It has been suggested that a specific dynamic scene perceptual-cognitive training procedure [the three-dimensional multiple object tracking speed task (3D-MOT)] helps observers manage socially relevant stimuli such as human body movements as seen in crowds or during sports activities. Here, we test this assertion by assessing whether training older observers on 3D-MOT can improve biological motion (BM) perception. Research has shown that healthy older adults require more distance in virtual space between themselves and a point-light walker to integrate BM information than younger adults. Their performances decreased markedly at a distance as far away as 4m (critical for collision avoidance), whereas performance in young adults remained constant up to 1m. We trained observers between 64 and 73 years of age on the 3D-MOT speed task and looked at BM perception at 4 and 16m distances in virtual space. We also had a control group trained on a visual task and a third group without training. The perceptual-cognitive training eliminated the difference in BM perception between 4 and 16m after only a few weeks, whereas the two control groups showed no transfer. This demonstrates that 3D-MOT training could be a good generic process for helping certain observers deal with socially relevant dynamic scenes.

Recently, studies using the rat animal model found that the pups of mothers who exercised during pregnancy had increased hippocampal neurogenesis and better memory and learning abilities. The aim of this report is to present the experimental protocol of a study that is designed to verify if an active lifestyle during pregnancy in humans has an impact on the newborn's brain. Methods: 60 pregnant women will be included in a randomized controlled study. The experimental group will be asked to exercise a minimum of 20 minutes three times per week, at a minimal intensity of 55% of their maximal aerobic capacity. The control group will not be exercising. The effect of exercise during pregnancy on the newborn's brain will be investigated 8 to 12 days postpartum by means of the mismatch negativity, a neurophysiological brain potential that is associated to auditory sensory memory. We hypothesize that children born to mothers who exercised during their pregnancy will present shorter latencies and larger mismatch negativity amplitudes, indicating more efficient auditory memory processes. Discussion: As of September 2011, 17 women have joined the study. Preliminary results show that the experimental group are active 3.1 +/- 0.9 days per week while the control group only exercise 0.8 +/- 0.6 days per week. The results of this study will present insight on fetal neuroplasticity and will be a valuable tool for health professionals who wish to encourage pregnant women to exercise.

Ubiquitous [Na+](i)/[K+](i)-Sensitive Transcriptome in Mammalian Cells: Evidence for Ca-i(2+)-Independent Excitation-Transcription Coupling	PLOS ONE			English	Article							VASCULAR SMOOTH-MUSCLE; FOCAL CEREBRAL-ISCHEMIA; ACUTE KIDNEY INJURY; GENE-EXPRESSION; SITE UPSTREAM; SODIUM-PUMP; CALCIUM; PROTEIN; ACTIVATION; NA+	Stimulus-dependent elevation of intracellular Ca2+([Ca2+](i)) affects the expression of numerous genes - a phenomenon known as excitation-transcription coupling. Recently, we found that increases in [Na+](i) trigger c-Fos expression via a novel Ca-i(2+)-independent pathway. In the present study, we identified ubiquitous and tissue-specific [Na+](i)/[K+](i)-sensitive transcriptomes by comparative analysis of differentially expressed genes in vascular smooth muscle cells from rat aorta (RVSMC), the human adenocarcinoma cell line HeLa, and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). To augment [Na+](i) and reduce [K+](i), cells were treated for 3 hrs with the Na+, K+-ATPase inhibitor ouabain or placed for the same time in the K+-free medium. Employing Affymetrix-based technology, we detected changes in expression levels of 684, 737 and 1839 transcripts in HeLa, HUVEC and RVSMC, respectively, that were highly correlated between two treatments (p<0.0001; R-2>0.62). Among these Na-i(+)/K-i(+)-sensitive genes, 80 transcripts were common for all three types of cells. To establish if changes in gene expression are dependent on increases in [Ca2+](i), we performed identical experiments in Ca2+-free media supplemented with extracellular and intracellular Ca2+ chelators. Surprisingly, this procedure elevated rather than decreased the number of ubiquitous and cell-type specific Na-i(+)/ K-i(+)-sensitive genes. Among the ubiquitous Na-i(+)/ K-i(+)-sensitive genes whose expression was regulated independently of the presence of Ca2+ chelators by more than 3-fold, we discovered several transcription factors (Fos, Jun, Hes1, Nfkbia), interleukin-6, protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit, dual specificity phosphatase (Dusp8), prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2, cyclin L1, whereas expression of metallopeptidase Adamts1, adrenomedulin, Dups1, Dusp10 and Dusp16 was detected exclusively in Ca2+-depleted cells. Overall, our findings indicate that Ca-i(2+)-independent mechanisms of excitation-transcription coupling are involved in transcriptomic alterations triggered by elevation of the [Na+](i)/[K+](i) ratio. There results likely have profound implications for normal and pathological regulation of mammalian cells, including sustained excitation of neuronal cells, intensive exercise and ischemia-triggered disorders.

J	Balaban, E; Desco, M; Vaquero, JJ				Balaban, Evan; Desco, Manuel; Vaquero, Juan-Jose			Waking-like Brain Function in Embryos	CURRENT BIOLOGY			English	Article							SLEEP-WAKE CYCLICITY; FETAL SHEEP; NERVOUS-SYSTEM; VIBROACOUSTIC STIMULATION; DEVELOPING CHICK; MAMMALIAN SLEEP; SPINAL-CORD; PATTERNS; ONTOGENY; BEHAVIOR	Background: Experience-dependent plastic changes in the brain underlying complex forms of learning are generally initiated when organisms are awake, and this may limit the earliest developmental time at which learning about external events can take place. It is not known whether waking-like brain function is present prenatally in higher vertebrate (bird or mammal) embryos, or whether embryos have brain circuitry that can selectively turn on a waking-like state in response to salient external sensory stimulation. Results: Combining submillimeter-resolution brain positron emission tomography (PET), structural X-ray computed tomography (CT) of the skeleton for fine-scale embryo aging, and noninvasive behavioral recording of chicken embryos in the egg revealed unexpectedly wide variation in prenatal brain activity, inversely related to behavioral activity, which developed into different sleep-like fetal brain states. Brief prenatal exposure to a salient chicken vocalization (eliciting strong postnatal behavioral responses) increased higher-brain activity significantly more than a spectrally and temporally matching "nonvocal" noise analog. Patterns of correlated activity between the brainstem and higher-brain areas resembling awake, posthatching animals were seen exclusively in chicken-stimulated embryos. Conclusions: Waking-like brain function is present in a latent but inducible state during the final 20% of embryonic life, selectively modulated by context-dependent monitoring circuitry. These data also reveal the developmental emergence of sleep-like behavior and its linkage to metabolic brain states and highlight problems with assigning embryo brain states based on behavioral observations.

Inhibition of mTORC1 is thus regarded as a promising strategy in the treatment of tumors with elevated mTORC1 activity. We have recently identified niclosamide (a Food and Drug Administration-approved antihelminthic drug) as an inhibitor of mTORC1 signaling. In the present study, we explored possible mechanisms by which niclosamide may inhibit mTORC1 signaling. We tested whether niclosamide interferes with signaling cascades upstream of mTORC1, the catalytic activity of mTOR, or mTORC1 assembly. We found that niclosamide does not impair PI3K/Akt signaling, nor does it inhibit mTORC1 kinase activity. We also found that niclosamide does not interfere with mTORC1 assembly. Previous studies in helminths suggest that niclosamide disrupts pH homeostasis of the parasite. This prompted us to investigate whether niclosamide affects the pH balance of cancer cells. Experiments in both breast cancer cells and cell-free systems demonstrated that niclosamide possesses protonophoric activity in cells and in vitro. In cells, niclosamide dissipated protons (down their concentration gradient) from lysosomes to the cytosol, effectively lowering cytoplasmic pH. Notably, analysis of five niclosamide analogs revealed that the structural features of niclosamide required for protonophoric activity are also essential for mTORC1 inhibition. Furthermore, lowering cytoplasmic pH by means other than niclosamide treatment (e.g. incubation with propionic acid or bicarbonate withdrawal) recapitulated the inhibitory effects of niclosamide on mTORC1 signaling, lending support to a possible role for cytoplasmic pH in the control of mTORC1. Our data illustrate a potential mechanism for chemical inhibition of mTORC1 signaling involving modulation of cytoplasmic pH.

The danger of reseeding malignancies could be eliminated by in vitro maturation of primordial follicles from the frozen-thawed tissue. However, the development of this system is hindered by uncertainties regarding factors that activate primordial follicles. Neuronal growth factors such as vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) play important roles in early mammalian folliculogenesis. There are no data on the expression of VIP and its vasoactive intestinal peptide pituitary adenylate cyclase 1 and 2 receptors (VPAC1-R and VPAC2-R) in human preantral follicles. Methodology/Principal Findings: Tissue samples from 14 human fetal ovaries and 40 ovaries from girls/women were prepared to test for the expression of VIP, VPAC1-R, and VPAC2-R on the protein (immunohistochemisty) and mRNA (reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction) levels. Immunohistochemistry staining was mostly weak, especially in fetal samples. The VIP protein was identified in oocytes and granulosa cells (GCs) in the fetal samples from 22 gestational weeks (GW) onwards. In girls/women, VIP follicular staining (oocytes and GCs) was identified in 45% of samples. VPAC1-R protein was identified in follicles in all fetal samples from 22GW onwards and in 63% of the samples from girls/women (GC staining only in 40%). VPAC2-R protein was identified in follicles in 33% of fetal samples and 47% of the samples from girls/women. The mRNA transcripts for VIP, VPAC1-R, and VPAC2-R were identified in ovarian extracts from fetuses and women. Conclusions: VIP and its two receptors are expressed in human ovarian preantral follicles. However, their weak staining suggests they have limited roles in early follicular growth.

J	Lussier, M; Gagnon, C; Bherer, L				Lussier, Maxime; Gagnon, Christine; Bherer, Louis			An investigation of response and stimulus modality transfer effects after dual-task training in younger and older	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						cognitive plasticity; cognitive training; transfer; divided attention; executive function; aging	ATTENTIONAL CONTROL; EXECUTIVE CONTROL; AGE-DIFFERENCES; COGNITIVE PLASTICITY; FAR TRANSFER; DRIVING PERFORMANCE; VISUAL-ATTENTION; WORKING-MEMORY; ADULTS; BRAIN	It has been shown that dual-task training leads to significant improvement in dual-task performance in younger and older adults. However, the extent to which training benefits to untrained tasks requires further investigation. The present study assessed (a) whether dual-task training leads to cross-modality transfer in untrained tasks using new stimuli and/or motor responses modalities, (b) whether transfer effects are related to improved ability to prepare and maintain multiple task-set and/or enhanced response coordination, (c) whether there are age-related differences in transfer effects. Twenty-three younger and 23 older adults were randomly assigned to dual-task training or control conditions. All participants were assessed before and after training on three dual-task transfer conditions; (1) stimulus modality transfer (2) response modality transfer (3) stimulus and response modalities transfer task. Training group showed larger improvement than the control group in the three transfer dual-task conditions, which suggests that training leads to more than specific learning of stimuli/response associations. Attentional costs analyses showed that training led to improved dual-task cost, only in conditions that involved new stimuli or response modalities, but not both. Moreover, training did not lead to a reduced task-set cost in the transfer conditions, which suggests some limitations in transfer effects that can be expected. Overall, the present study supports the notion that cognitive plasticity for attentional control is preserved in late adulthood.

Moreover, tau accumulates in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of AD's patients. The mechanisms underlying the propagation of tau pathology and its accumulation in the CSF remain to be elucidated. Recent studies have reported that human tau was secreted by neurons and non-neuronal cells when it was overexpressed indicating that tau secretion could contribute to the spreading of tau pathology in the brain and could lead to its accumulation in the CSF. In the present study, we showed that the overexpression of human tau resulted in its secretion by Hela cells. The main form of tau secreted by these cells was cleaved at the C-terminal. Surprisingly, secreted tau was dephosphorylated at several sites in comparison to intracellular tau which presented a strong immunoreactivity to all phospho-dependent antibodies tested. Our data also revealed that phosphorylation and cleavage of tau favored its secretion by Hela cells. Indeed, the mimicking of phosphorylation at 12 sites known to be phosphorylated in AD enhanced tau secretion. A mutant form of tau truncated at D421, the preferential cleavage site of caspase-3, was also significantly more secreted than wild-type tau. Taken together, our results indicate that hyperphosphorylation and cleavage of tau by favoring its secretion could contribute to the propagation of tau pathology in the brain and its accumulation in the CSF.

In a context of visual selective attention, the current study compared task-related activation with BOLD fMRI signals in younger (N=16) and older (N=16) adults using a letter-name-matching task with two attentional load levels. In the low-load condition, the target letter might share the same identity (e.g., a/A) with one of two probes in the display, while in the high-load condition the display included four probes. The results suggest that there is an age-related change within the frontoparietal network that underlies visual selective attention processing. In the low-load condition, the older group needed to recruit more bilateral frontal regions to successfully perform the task, while the younger participants recruited more bilateral occipital regions, in agreement with the PASA (Posterior-Anterior Shift in Aging) phenomenon and the neural compensation hypothesis of cognitive reserve. In addition, in the high-load condition, we found a load-dependent posterior-anterior shift in the older participants, which was not present in the younger ones, involving the anterior part of the cingulate cortex. By showing a load-dependent PASA, our study indicates that the PASA phenomenon is supported more by the compensation mechanism (solicited exclusively in older participants) than by the reserve.

B cells present antigen, activate T cells, and are involved in immunoregulation and cytokine secretion. To determine if B cells from MS patients secrete products that have deleterious effects on glial cells not mediated by Ig, and to compare effects with secretory products of normal controls (NC), we isolated B cells from 7 patients with relapsing remitting MS (RRMS) and 4 NC. B cells were cultured alone or after stimulation with CD40 ligand (CD40L),CD40L + cross-linking of the B cell antigen receptor (xBCR) and CD40L + xBCR + stimulation of toll like receptor 9 (TLR9). Supernatants were harvested and incubated with mixed central nervous system (CNS) neonatal rat glial cells. Supernatants from unstimulated NC B cells induced on average death of 7% (range 0-24%) of differentiated oligodendrocytes (OL); in contrast, supernatants from unstimulated B cells from RRMS patients induced death of 57% (range 35-74%) of OL Supernatants of stimulated B cells from NC did not increase the minimal OL death whereas stimulation of B cells from RRMS had variable results compared to unstimulated B cells. Supernatants from both NC and RAMS induced microglial enlargement and loss of normal resting bipolar morphology. OL death did not correlate with levels of tumor necrosis alpha (TNF-alpha), lymphotoxin alpha (LT-alpha), interleukin 6 (IL-6), IL-10, transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) or any combination or ratio of these cytokines. Analysis of 26 supernatants from NC and RRMS patients failed to detect IgM. There were very low levels of IgG in 8 of the 26 supernatants, and no correlation between of OL death and presence or absence of IgG. Sera used in both the B cell and glial cell cultures were heated, which inactivates complement. The effects of B cell supernatants on 01 could be direct and/or indirect involving either microglia and/or astrocytes. The identity of the toxic factor(s) is as yet unknown. Thus we have demonstrated that B cells from patients with RRMS but not NC secrete one or more factors toxic to OL It is possible that such factors produced by peripheral blood B cells when within the CNS could contribute to demyelination in MS patients.

Task-related BOLD responses and resting-state functional connectivity during physiological clamping of end-tidal CO2	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						End-tidal CO2 fluctuations; Physiological noise; Resting-state functional connectivity; Task-related response; Default-mode-network; BOLD fMRI	DEFAULT-MODE NETWORK; CEREBRAL-BLOOD-FLOW; HEALTHY-SUBJECTS; BRAIN IMAGES; FMRI; NOISE; MRI; OPTIMIZATION; ROBUST; FLUCTUATIONS	Carbon dioxide (CO2), a potent vasodilator, is known to have a significant impact on the blood-oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal. With the growing interest in studying synchronized BOLD fluctuations during the resting state, the extent to which the apparent synchrony is due to variations in the end-tidal pressure of CO2 (PETCO2) is an important consideration. CO2-related fluctuations in BOLD signal may also represent a potential confound when studying task-related responses, especially if breathing depth and rate are affected by the task. While previous studies of the above issues have explored retrospective correction of BOLD fluctuations related to arterial PCO2, here we demonstrate an alternative approach based on physiological clamping of the arterial CO2 level to a near-constant value. We present data comparing resting-state functional connectivity within the default-mode-network (DMN), as well as task-related BOLD responses, acquired in two conditions in each subject: 1) while subject's PETCO2 was allowed to vary spontaneously; and 2) while controlling subject's PETCO2 within a narrow range. Strong task-related responses and areas of maximal signal correlation in the DMN were not significantly altered by suppressing fluctuations in PETCO2. Controlling PETCO2 did, however, improve the performance of retrospective physiological noise correction techniques, allowing detection of additional regions of task-related response and resting-state connectivity in highly vascularized regions such as occipital cortex. While these results serve to further rule out systemic physiological fluctuations as a significant source of apparent resting-state network connectivity, they also demonstrate that fluctuations in arterial CO2 are one of the factors limiting sensitivity in task-based and resting-state fMRI, particularly in regions of high vascular density. This must be considered when comparing subject groups who might exhibit differences in respiratory physiology or breathing patterns. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The number of targets had no impact on the N400 brain potential, the index of semantic processing, nor on the late positive component (LPC), an index of episodic encoding and retrieval. Analyses of the effects of the number of repetitions showed that the duration of semantic processes - assessed by measuring N400 latency - was linearly shortened along repetitions while their extent - as indexed by N400 amplitude - remained constant after the second presentation. In contrast, the extent of episodic processes - as indexed by LPC amplitude - was found to increase linearly with repetition. By showing that N400 latency may be much less stable than previously thought, these results bring new constraints on the functional correlates of this key stage in the processing of semantic information. They also suggest that semantic processes can be studied at high repetition rates whatever the number of target stimuli. Finally, our findings show that each episode of prior presentation has an impact on the late processing of a stimulus despite the absence of an explicit memory task. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Using 1326 subjects from the IMAGEN study, we first give a global picture of the evolution of the group effect t-value from a simple face-watching contrast with increasing cohort size. We obtain a wide activated pattern, far from being limited to the reasonably expected brain areas, illustrating the difference between statistical significance and practical significance. This motivates us to inject tissue-probability information into the group estimation, we model the BOLD contrast using a matter-weighted mixture of Gaussians and compare it to the common, single-Gaussian model. In both cases, the model parameters are estimated per-voxel for one subgroup, and the likelihood of both models is computed on a second, separate subgroup to reflect model generalization capacity. Various group sizes are tested, and significance is asserted using a 10-fold cross-validation scheme. We conclude that adding matter information consistently improves the quantitative analysis of BOLD responses in some areas of the brain, particularly those where accurate inter-subject registration remains challenging.

Expanded ATXN3 frameshifting events are toxic in Drosophila and mammalian neuron models	HUMAN MOLECULAR GENETICS			English	Article							OCULOPHARYNGEAL MUSCULAR-DYSTROPHY; RNA; POLYALANINE; EXPANSIONS; DISEASE; SIGNALS; GENE; IDENTIFICATION; SEQUESTRATION; ATAXIN-3	Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 is caused by the expansion of the coding CAG repeat in the ATXN3 gene. Interestingly, a 1 bp frameshift occurring within an (exp)CAG repeat would henceforth lead to translation from a GCA frame, generating polyalanine stretches instead of polyglutamine. Our results show that transgenic expression of (exp)CAG ATXN3 led to 1 frameshifting events, which have deleterious effects in Drosophila and mammalian neurons. Conversely, transgenic expression of polyglutamine-encoding (exp)CAA ATXN3 was not toxic. Furthermore, (exp)CAG ATXN3 mRNA does not contribute per se to the toxicity observed in our models. Our observations indicate that expanded polyglutamine tracts in Drosophila and mouse neurons are insufficient for the development of a phenotype. Hence, we propose that 1 ribosomal frameshifting contributes to the toxicity associated with (exp)CAG repeats.

Bcl-2-associated autophagy regulator Naf-1 required for maintenance of skeletal muscle	HUMAN MOLECULAR GENETICS			English	Article							MITOCHONDRIAL-MEMBRANE PROTEIN; BECLIN 1-DEPENDENT AUTOPHAGY; ENDOPLASMIC-RETICULUM; TRANSMEMBRANE PROTEIN; DIABETES-MELLITUS; WOLFRAM-SYNDROME; OPTIC ATROPHY; BCL-2; APOPTOSIS; EXPRESSION	Nutrient-deprivation autophagy factor-1 (NAF-1) was identified as an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) BCL-2-interacting protein, which functions to mediate the ability of ER BCL-2 to antagonize Beclin 1-dependent autophagy and depress ER calcium stores. In humans, a point mutation in Naf-1 (synonyms: Cisd2, Eris, Miner1 and Noxp70) is responsible for the neurodegenerative disorder Wolfram Syndrome 2. Here, we describe the generation and characterization of the Naf-1 gene deletion in mice. Naf-1 null mice display discernable clinical signs of degeneration at 23 months of age, with early evidence of significant defects in the structure and performance of skeletal muscle. Skeletal muscles from Naf-1 knockout mice demonstrate a significant shift towards slow-twitch (type I) fibers and greater resistance to muscle fatigue. Force-generating capacity is dramatically reduced in Naf-1(/) muscle. Consistent with its role in ER BCL-2-mediated regulation of autophagy and calcium flux, these physiological deficiencies were accompanied by augmented autophagy and dysregulated calcium homeostasis. In contrast, this also included adaptive enlargement of mitochondria with extensive cristae structures. Thus, NAF-1, a BCL-2-associated autophagy regulator, is required for homeostatic maintenance of skeletal muscle. Our findings uncover a novel pathway that is required for normal muscle maintenance, which may ultimately provide a novel therapeutic target for treating certain muscle pathologies.

Adults experiencing this musical disorder in the absence of macroscopically visible brain injury are described as cases of congenital amusia under the assumption that the musical deficits have been present from birth. Here, we show that this disorder can be expressed in the developing brain. We found that (10-13 year-old) children exhibit a marked deficit in the detection of fine-grained pitch differences in both musical and acoustical context in comparison to their normally developing peers comparable in age and general intelligence. This behavioral deficit could be traced down to their abnormal P300 brain responses to the detection of subtle pitch changes. The altered pattern of electrical activity does not seem to arise from an anomalous functioning of the auditory cortex, because all early components of the brain potentials, the N100, the MMN, and the P200 appear normal. Rather, the brain and behavioral measures point to disrupted information propagation from the auditory cortex to other cortical regions. Furthermore, the behavioral and neural manifestations of the disorder remained unchanged after 4 weeks of daily musical listening. These results show that congenital amusia can be detected in childhood despite regular musical exposure and normal intellectual functioning.

The molecular mechanism of this regulation is not well understood, but several observations suggest a role for posteriorizing Cdx transcription factors (Cdx1/2/4) in this process. Cdx genes are known as integrators of posteriorizing signals from Wnt, retinoic acid, and FGF pathways. In this work, we report that Wnt-mediated regulation of murine Pax3 expression is indirect and involves Cdx proteins as intermediates. We show that Pax3 transcripts co-localize with Cdx proteins in the posterior neurectoderm and that neural Pax3 expression is reduced in Cdx1-null embryos. Using Wnt3a-treated P19 cells and neural crest-derived Neuro2a cells, we demonstrate that Pax3 expression is induced by the Wnt-Cdx pathway. Co-transfection analyses, electrophoretic mobility shift assays, chromatin immuno-precipitation, and transgenic studies further indicate that Cdx proteins operate via direct binding to an evolutionarily conserved neural crest enhancer of the Pax3 proximal promoter. Taken together, these results suggest a novel neural function for Cdx proteins within the gene regulatory network controlling neural crest development.

Numerous studies have demonstrated that IGF-1 promotes neuronal cell survival via the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Proline-rich Akt substrate of 40 kDa (PRAS40) is a recently discovered downstream target of Akt. However, the relationship between IGF-1 and PRAS40 is not known. In this study, we characterized the phosphorylation of PRAS40 induced by IGF-1 in PC12 cells and explored the signaling pathway responsible for the effect of IGF-1. IGF-1 induced the phosphorylation of Akt at Thr473 and PRAS40 at Thr246 in PC12 cells. The phosphorylation of Akt and PRAS40 induced by IGF-1 (100 ng/ml) was inhibited by the phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) specific inhibitor LY294002 (50 mu M), while no inhibitory effect was observed for a MAPK kinase pathway specific inhibitor PD98059 nor a p38 MAPK inhibitor PD169316, suggesting that the phosphorylation of PRAS40 induced by IGF-1 is mediated by the PI3K pathway in PC12 cells and primary cultured neurons. In further support this hypothesis, an Akt kinase specific inhibitor, Akt inhibitor VIII, attenuated IGF-1-induced phosphorylation of PRAS40 at the concentration that blocked the phosphorylation of Akt induced by IGF-1. Taken together, these data demonstrate that IGF-1 stimulates the phosphorylation of PRAS40 at Thr246 in neuronal cells and the effect of IGF-1 is mediated, at least in part, by the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.

Maternal Wnt/beta-Catenin Signaling Coactivates Transcription through NF-kappa B Binding Sites during Xenopus Axis Formation	PLOS ONE			English	Article							TOLL-LIKE-RECEPTORS; BETA-CATENIN; SPEMANN ORGANIZER; NEURAL INDUCTION; GENE-EXPRESSION; LAEVIS EMBRYOS; ACTIVE REPRESSION; DROSOPHILA EMBRYO; ACTIVATION; PROTEIN	Maternal Wnt/beta-Catenin signaling establishes a program of dorsal-specific gene expression required for axial patterning in Xenopus. We previously reported that a subset of dorsally expressed genes depends not only on Wnt/beta-Catenin stimulation, but also on a MyD88-dependent Toll-like receptor/IL1-receptor (TLR/IL1-R) signaling pathway. Here we show that these two signal transduction cascades converge in the nucleus to coactivate gene transcription in blastulae through a direct interaction between beta-Catenin and NF-kappa B proteins. A transdominant inhibitor of NF-kappa B, Delta NI kappa B alpha, phenocopies loss of MyD88 protein function, implicating Rel/NF-kappa B proteins as selective activators of dorsal-specific gene expression. Sensitive axis formation assays in the embryo demonstrate that dorsalization by Wnt/beta-Catenin requires NF-kappa B protein activity, and vice versa. Xenopus nodal-related 3 (Xnr3) is one of the genes with dual beta-Catenin/NF-kappa B input, and a proximal NF-kappa B consensus site contributes to the regional activity of its promoter. We demonstrate in vitro binding of Xenopus beta-Catenin to several XRel proteins. This interaction is observed in vivo upon Wnt-stimulation. Finally, we show that a synthetic luciferase reporter gene responds to both endogenous and exogenous beta-Catenin levels in an NF-kappa B motif dependent manner. These results suggest that beta-Catenin acts as a transcriptional co-activator of NF-kappa B-dependent transcription in frog primary embryonic cells.

Evolutionarily Conserved Paired Immunoglobulin-like Receptor alpha (PILR alpha) Domain Mediates Its Interaction with Diverse Sialylated Ligands	JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							TYPE-2 RECEPTOR; INHIBITORY RECEPTOR; SCAVENGER RECEPTOR; GLYCOPROTEIN-B; BINDING-SITE; PROTEIN; CELLS; CD99; RECOGNITION; SIALOADHESIN	Paired immunoglobulin-like receptor (PILR) alpha is an inhibitory receptor that recognizes several ligands, including mouse CD99, PILR-associating neural protein, and Herpes simplex virus-1 glycoprotein B. The physiological function(s) of interactions between PILR alpha and its cellular ligands are not well understood, as are the molecular determinants of PILR alpha/ligand interactions. To address these uncertainties, we sought to identify additional PILR alpha ligands and further define the molecular basis for PILR alpha/ligand interactions. Here, we identify two novel PILR alpha binding partners, neuronal differentiation and proliferation factor-1 (NPDC1), and collectin-12 (COLEC12). We find that sialylated O-glycans on these novel PILR alpha ligands, and on known PILR alpha ligands, are compulsory for PILR alpha binding. Sialylation-dependent ligand recognition is also a property of SIGLEC1, a member of the sialic acid-binding Ig-like lectins. SIGLEC1 Ig domain shares similar to 22% sequence identity with PILR alpha, an identity that includes a conserved arginine localized to position 97 in mouse and human SIGLEC1, position 133 in mouse PILR alpha and position 126 in human PILR alpha. We observe that PILR alpha/ligand interactions require conserved PILR alpha Arg-133 (mouse) and Arg-126 (human), in correspondence with a previously reported requirement for SIGLEC1 Arg-197 in SIGLEC1/ligand interactions. Homology modeling identifies striking similarities between PILR alpha and SIGLEC1 ligand binding pockets as well as at least one set of distinctive interactions in the galactoxyl-binding site. Binding studies suggest that PILR alpha recognizes a complex ligand domain involving both sialic acid and protein motif(s). Thus, PILR alpha is evolved to engage multiple ligands with common molecular determinants to modulate myeloid cell functions in anatomical settings where PILR alpha ligands are expressed.

SHANK1 Deletions in Males with Autism Spectrum Disorder	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF HUMAN GENETICS			English	Article							COPY-NUMBER VARIATION; SCAFFOLDING PROTEIN SHANK3; GENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION; DE-NOVO; MUTATIONS; VARIANTS; COMMON; GENE; PROSAP/SHANK; POPULATION	Recent studies have highlighted the involvement of rare (<1% frequency) copy-number variations and point mutations in the genetic etiology of autism spectrum disorder (ASD); these variants particularly affect genes involved in the neuronal synaptic complex. The SHANK gene family consists of three members (SHANK1, SHANK2, and SHANK3), which encode scaffolding proteins required for the proper formation and function of neuronal synapses. Although SHANK2 and SHANK3 mutations have been implicated in ASD and intellectual disability, the involvement of SHANK1 is unknown. Here, we assess microarray data from 1,158 Canadian and 456 European individuals with ASD to discover microdeletions at the SHANK1 locus on chromosome 19. We identify a hemizygous SHANK1 deletion that segregates in a four-generation family in which male carriers-but not female carriers-have ASD with higher functioning. A de novo SHANK1 deletion was also detected in an unrelated male individual with ASD with higher functioning, and no equivalent SHANK1 mutations were found in >15,000 controls (p = 0.009). The discovery of apparent reduced penetrance of ASD in females bearing inherited autosomal SHANK1 deletions provides a possible contributory model for the male gender bias in autism. The data are also informative for clinical-genetics interpretations of both inherited and sporadic forms of ASD involving SHANK1.

Music notation reading is an ideal stimulus to study multisensory learning, as it allows studying the integration of visual, auditory and sensorimotor information processing. The present study aimed at answering whether multisensory learning alters uni-sensory structures, interconnections of uni-sensory structures or specific multisensory areas. In a short-term piano training procedure musically naive subjects were trained to play tone sequences from visually presented patterns in a music notation-like system [Auditory-Visual-Somatosensory group (AVS)], while another group received audio-visual training only that involved viewing the patterns and attentively listening to the recordings of the AVS training sessions [Auditory-Visual group (AV)]. Training-related changes in cortical networks were assessed by pre- and post-training magnetoencephalographic (MEG) recordings of an auditory, a visual and an integrated audio-visual mismatch negativity (MMN). The two groups (AVS and AV) were differently affected by the training. The results suggest that multisensory training alters the function of multisensory structures, and not the uni-sensory ones along with their interconnections, and thus provide an answer to an important question presented by cognitive models of multisensory training.

Signal sequence and prodomain cleavage in the ER and Golgi apparatus, respectively, activates their adhesive properties. Here, we provide the first evidence for sorting of nonadhesive precursor N-cadherin (ProN) to the neuronal surface, where it coexists with adhesively competent mature N-cadherin (N-cad), generating a spectrum of adhesive strengths. In cultured hippocampal neurons, a high ProN/N-cad ratio downregulates synapse formation. Neurons expressing genetically engineered uncleavable ProN make markedly fewer synapses. The synapse number can be rescued to normality by depleting surface ProN levels through prodomain cleavage by an exogenous protease. Finally, prodomain processing is developmentally regulated in the rat hippocampus. We conclude that it is the ProN/N-cad ratio and not mature N-cad alone that is critical for regulation of adhesion during synaptogenesis.

J	Ran, I; Laplante, I; Lacaille, JC				Ran, Israeli; Laplante, Isabel; Lacaille, Jean-Claude			CREB-Dependent Transcriptional Control and Quantal Changes in Persistent Long-Term Potentiation in Hippocampal Interneurons	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							PERMEABLE AMPA RECEPTORS; ELEMENT-BINDING PROTEIN; LATE-PHASE; SYNAPTIC PLASTICITY; GENE-EXPRESSION; SILENT SYNAPSES; EXCITATORY SYNAPSES; NEURONAL-ACTIVITY; REGULATED KINASE; MEMORY	Mounting evidence indicates an important role of long-term synaptic plasticity in hippocampal inhibitory interneurons in learning and memory. The cellular and molecular mechanisms that underlie such persistent changes in synaptic function in interneurons remain, however, largely undetermined. A transcription- and translation-dependent form of long-term potentiation was uncovered at excitatory synapses onto hippocampal interneurons in oriens-alveus (OA-INs) which is induced by activation of type 1 metabotropic glutamate receptors (cL-LTPmGluR1). Here, we use (1) a combination of pharmacological siRNA knock-down and overexpression approaches to reveal the molecular mechanisms of transcriptional control via cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) during induction, and (2) quantal analysis to identify synaptic changes during maintenance of cL-LTPmGluR1 in rat hippocampus. Induction stimulated CREB phosphorylation in OA-INs via extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK) signaling. Also, CREB knockdown impaired cL-LTPmGluR1, whereas CREB overexpression facilitated the induction, demonstrating a necessary and permissive role of CREB via ERK signaling in transcriptional control in cL-LTPmGluR1. Quantal analysis of synaptic responses during cL-LTPmGluR1 maintenance revealed an increased number of quanta released, corresponding to enhanced transmitter release and a larger quantal size, indicating enhanced responsiveness to individual quanta. Fluctuation analysis of synaptic currents uncovered an increase in conductance and number of functional postsynaptic receptors contributing to single quanta. Our findings indicate that CREB-dependent transcription is a necessary permissive switch for eliciting persistent presynaptic and postsynaptic quantal changes at excitatory synapses in inhibitory local circuits, uncovering cell type-specific coupling of induction and expression mechanisms during persistent synaptic plasticity which may contribute to hippocampal long-term memory processes.

Neurother. 12(5), 557-567 (2012) Alzheimer's disease (AD) accounts for the majority of dementia cases and leaves clinicians, patients, family members, caregivers, and researchers faced with numerous ethical issues that vary and evolve as a function of disease stage and severity. While the disclosure of a diagnosis of AD dementia is difficult enough, advances in the neurobiology of AD embodied in the recent revisions to the AD diagnostic guidelines have translated into an increasing shift toward the diagnosis being made in its pre-dementia stages, when patients have full insight into their prognosis. Genetic issues in AD are significant in the case of rare families with an early onset (before age 65) form of the disease, owing to the presence of deterministic mutations. While genetic testing for the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene a risk factor for sporadic AD is widely debated, it may become necessary in the context of novel disease-modifying drugs. The current symptomatic drugs - cholinesterase inhibitors (CIs) and the NMDA receptor antagonist memantine - are relatively simple to use but their access is limited in many countries by economic considerations and therapeutic nihilism. Although their efficacy is modest, they influence the design of protocols for new drugs since placebo treatment in clinical trials involving patients with established dementia is rarely allowed beyond 3 months. Driving privileges are lost in the moderate stages of dementia, with this decision ideally reached using a standardized assessment algorithm. Physical restraints are still overused in moderate-to-severe stages, but the alternative non-pharmacological therapies and caregiver training programs are not yet fully validated using randomized studies. End-of-life care is slowly moving towards a palliative care approach similar to that for end-stage cancer. There will be new drugs in the near future, some of which will delay progression from prodromal stages to dementia, but their use will require careful stopping rules.

The SHh inhibitor cyclopamine induces apoptosis. The bioactive sphingolipid ceramide mediates cell death in response to various chemotherapeutic agents; however, ceramide's roles/mechanisms in cyclopamine-induced apoptosis are unknown. Here, we report that cyclopamine mediates ceramide generation selectively via induction of neutral sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase 3, SMPD3 (nSMase2) in Daoy human medulloblastoma cells. Importantly, short interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of nSMase2 prevented cyclopamine-induced ceramide generation and protected Daoy cells from drug-induced apoptosis. Accordingly, ectopic wild-type N-SMase2 caused cell death, compared with controls, which express the catalytically inactive N-SMase2 mutant. Interestingly, knockdown of smoothened (Smo), a target protein for cyclopamine, or Gli1, a downstream signaling transcription factor of Smo, did not affect nSMase2. Mechanistically, our data showed that cyclopamine induced nSMase2 and cell death selectively via increased nitric oxide (NO) generation by neuronal-nitric oxide synthase (n-NOS) induction, in Daoy medulloblastoma, and multiple other human cancer cell lines. Knockdown of n-NOS prevented nSMase2 induction and cell death in response to cyclopamine. Accordingly, N-SMase2 activity-deficient skin fibroblasts isolated from homozygous fro/fro (fragilitas ossium) mice exhibited resistance to NO-induced cell death. Thus, our data suggest a novel off-target function of cyclopamine in inducing apoptosis, at least in part, by n-NOS/NO-dependent induction of N-SMase2/ceramide axis, independent of Smo/Gli inhibition.

Arm and leg coordination during treadmill walking in individuals with motor incomplete spinal cord injury: A preliminary study	GAIT & POSTURE			English	Article						Motor control; Walking; Arm swing; Coordination; Spinal cord injury	PARKINSONS-DISEASE; LOWER-LIMBS; GAIT; STROKE; SPEED; ADAPTATION; LOCOMOTION; MOVEMENTS; PATTERNS; HEALTHY	Arm and leg coordination naturally emerges during walking, but can be affected by stroke or Parkinson's disease. The purpose of this preliminary study was to characterize arm and leg coordination during treadmill walking at self-selected comfortable walking speeds (CWSs) in individuals using arm swing with motor incomplete spinal cord injury (iSCI). Hip and shoulder angle cycle durations and amplitudes, strength of peak correlations between contralateral hip and shoulder joint angle time series, the time shifts at which these peak correlations occur, and associated variability were quantified. Outcomes in individuals with iSCI selecting fast CWSs (range. 1.0-1.3 m/s) and speed-matched individuals without neurological injuries are similar. Differences, however, are detected in individuals with iSCI selecting slow CWSs (range, 0.25-0.65 m/s) and may represent compensatory strategies to improve walking balance or forward propulsion. These individuals elicit a 1:1, arm:leg frequency ratio versus the 2:1 ratio observed in non-injured individuals. Shoulder and hip movement patterns, however, are highly reproducible (coordinated) in participants with iSCI, regardless of CWS. This high degree of inter-extremity coordination could reflect an inability to modify a single movement pattern post-iSCI. Combined, these data suggest inter-extremity walking coordination May be altered, but is present after iSCI, and therefore may be regulated, in part, by neural control. Published by Elsevier EN.

Statistical population comparison of different age or clinical groups rely on the relative homogeneous distribution of measurements across subjects in order to infer changes in brain function. In the context of an increasing use of diffuse optical imaging with older adult populations, changes in tissue properties and anatomy with age adds additional confounds. Few studies investigated these changes with age. Duncan et al. measured the so-called diffusion path length factor (DPF) in a large population but did not explore beyond the age of 51 after which physiological and anatomical changes are expected to occur [Pediatr. Res. 39(5), 889-894 (1996)]. With increasing interest in studying the geriatric population with optical imaging, we studied changes in tissue properties in young and old subjects using both magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided Monte-Carlo simulations and time-domain diffuse optical imaging. Our results, measured in the frontal cortex, show changes in DPF that are smaller than previously measured by Duncan et al. in a younger population. The origin of these changes are studied using simulations and experimental measures. (C) 2012 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).

Deciphering these complex interplays is the key to getting a comprehensive picture of cellular behavior and to understanding biological systems, from a simple bacterial cell to highly regulated neuronal cells or cancerous tissue. In the last decade, affinity purification (AP) coupled to mass spectrometry has emerged as a powerful tool to comprehensively study interaction networks and their macromolecular assemblies. This review discusses recent advances in AP approaches, from cell lysis to the importance of sample preparation and the choice of AP matrix as well as the development of different epitope tags and strategies to study dynamic interactions, with an emphasis on RNAprotein interaction networks.

We therefore aimed to evaluate smell function in athletes who sustained one or more sport concussions in a cross-sectional design. Methods: Twenty-two University-level football players with one or multiple concussions and 13 control athletes without a history of concussion participated. We measured olfactory function by using the Sniffin' Sticks test to assess subjects' ability to discriminate and identify odors as well as their detection thresholds. In addition, we assessed odor intensity and pleasantness. Results: We used number of concussions and time since the last concussion as independent variables and measure of olfactory function as dependent variables. Although we did not observe any significant effect of the number of concussions, athletes with a longer delay from time of concussion scored significantly weaker than more recently concussed subjects on the odor identification test and on an aggregate olfactory score. Accordingly, we observed a significant negative linear correlation between the odor identification score and the time elapsed since the last concussion. Conclusion: These findings suggest a possible degenerative effect of concussions on olfactory function.

Silicon optoelectronic microelectrodes with integrated oxygen sensors for brain-machine interfaces	MICRO & NANO LETTERS			English	Article							NEURAL PROSTHETICS; TISSUE OXYGENATION; FMRI SIGNAL; BLOOD-FLOW; CORTEX; RAT; ACTIVATION; NETWORKS	In neural prosthetic systems, microelectrodes implanted in the brain record the electro-potentials elicited by specific thoughts and relay the signals to algorithms trained to translate the electrical activity into intended action. The authors describe novel elongated silicon optoelectronic neural electrodes that can record electrical signals and specific neural biomarkers. Specifically, the authors describe the integration of optical oxygen (O-2) sensors with silicon neural microelectrodes. The O-2 sensors are sol-gel derived xerogel thin films, that are coated on the exposed core of an optical fibre, that encapsulate O-2 responsive luminophores tris(4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline) ruthenium(II) in their porous structures. The electrodes were inserted into the trunk region of the somatosensory cortex and lowered into the barrel field of a rat. Oxygen and action potential recordings during whisker stimulation provide support for the potential utility of the device. The proposed optoelectronic neural electrodes, which can reach depths greater than 10 mm in the brain, could help the development of intelligent and more user-friendly neural prosthesis/ brain machine interfaces as well as aid in providing answers to complex brain diseases and disorders.

Neuropsychological investigations in the past two decades have demonstrated that neglect is caused by deficits affecting a widespread cortico-subcortical fronto-parietal network controlling spatial attention, but usually sparing early sensory pathways. As a consequence, certain residual abilities in sensory processing remain intact and still take place for stimuli in the neglected space, such as the extraction and organization of coherent or meaningful object features. Moreover, these residual abilities can alleviate inattention symptoms when contralesional stimuli are perceptually or biologically salient. Here we review recent studies suggesting that the emotional content of stimuli may also be processed despite impaired attention towards contralesional space, and that such processing may act to enhance attention and partly reduce neglect for these stimuli, relative to similar but emotionally neutral stimuli. For example, faces with emotional expressions, voices with emotional prosody, as well as pictures of scenes or even spiders have been found to be less severely extinguished from awareness in conditions of bilateral stimulations, and/or lead to fewer omissions in search tasks with multiple distracters. Gaze cues and reward learning might also produce similar effects. Altogether, these findings suggest that emotionally significant information is not only extracted from stimuli at neglected locations through spared pathways, but can also induce emotional biases in attention that partly counteract the abnormal spatial biases caused by fronto-parietal damage. We discuss results from neuropsychology and neuroimaging research suggesting that specific mechanisms for emotional attention might exist, centered on the amygdala and other limbic regions, and that these mechanisms can operate partly independent from other circuits controlling spatial and object-based attention. Although we are only beginning to understand these interactive effects of emotion and attention and to identify their neuroanatomical substrates, we believe that a deeper knowledge of such mechanisms and their conditions of optimal operation will help develop or improve therapeutic strategies in neglect patients.

There are few established predictors of dementia in PD. In numerous cross-sectional studies, patients with rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD) have increased cognitive impairment on neuropsychological testing, but no prospective studies have assessed whether RBD can predict Parkinson's dementia. PD patients who were free of dementia were enrolled in a prospective follow-up of a previously published cross-sectional study. All patients had a polysomnogram at baseline. Over a mean 4-year follow-up, the incidence of dementia was assessed in those with or without RBD at baseline using regression analysis, adjusting for age, sex, disease duration, and follow-up duration. Of 61 eligible patients, 45 (74%) were assessed and 42 were included in a full analysis. Twenty-seven patients had baseline RBD, and 15 did not. Four years after the initial evaluation, 48% with RBD developed dementia, compared to 0% of those without (P-adjusted = 0.014). All 13 patients who developed dementia had mild cognitive impairment on baseline examination. Baseline REM sleep atonia loss predicted development of dementia (% tonic REM = 73.2 +/- 26.7 with dementia, 40.8 +/- 34.5 without; P = 0.029). RBD at baseline also predicted the new development of hallucinations and cognitive fluctuations. In this prospective study, RBD was associated with increased risk of dementia. This indicates that RBD may be a marker of a relatively diffuse, complex subtype of PD.

The suggested immobilization test (SIT) is validated for diagnosis of primary RLS. This study evaluated the usefulness of the SIT for diagnosis of RLS in PD. We compared SIT scores, as well as polysomnography measures in 50 patients with PD (25 with RLS, 25 without), 25 patients with primary RLS, and 25 age/sex matched controls. Mean leg discomfort score was increased in patients with PD and RLS compared to PD without RLS, and also in patients with primary RLS compared to controls. Leg discomfort was significantly higher at the end of the test in patients with RLS compared to patients without RLS. Intensity of leg discomfort was similar between patients with RLS, with or without PD. Using a mean leg discomfort cutoff of 11, we showed sensitivity of 91% and specificity of 72% for RLS diagnosis in PD during symptomatic time intervals. Periodic leg movements index during the SIT did not differ between groups. Periodic leg movements index during sleep and wakefulness was increased in patients with primary RLS compared to controls, but did not differ between patients with PD, with and without RLS. The sensory SIT is a simple test that may help diagnose RLS in patients with PD.

Although these loci have previously been associated with adult height(1), their effects on infant head circumference were largely independent of height (P = 3.8 x 10(-7) for rs7980687 and P = 1.3 x 10(-7) for rs1042725 after adjustment for infant height). A third signal, rs11655470 on chromosome 17q21, showed suggestive evidence of association with head circumference (P = 3.9 x 10(-6)). SNPs correlated to the 17q21 signal have shown genome-wide association with adult intracranial volume(2), Parkinson's disease and other neurodegenerative diseases(3-5), indicating that a common genetic variant in this region might link early brain growth with neurological disease in later life.

Early Growth Genetics EGG Consorti; Cohorts Heart Aging Res Genomic Ep	Common variants at 6q22 and 17q21 are associated with intracranial volume	NATURE GENETICS			English	Article							MATTER HYPERINTENSITY VOLUME; GENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION; MICRODELETION SYNDROME; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; BRAIN; INVERSION; INTELLIGENCE; EVOLUTION; HAPLOTYPE; DEMENTIA	During aging, intracranial volume remains unchanged and represents maximally attained brain size, while various interacting biological phenomena lead to brain volume loss. Consequently, intracranial volume and brain volume in late life reflect different genetic influences. Our genome-wide association study (GWAS) in 8,175 community-dwelling elderly persons did not reveal any associations at genome-wide significance (P < 5 x 10(-8)) for brain volume. In contrast, intracranial volume was significantly associated with two loci: rs4273712 (P = 3.4 x 10(-11)), a known height-associated locus on chromosome 6q22, and rs9915547 (P = 1.5 x 10(-12)), localized to the inversion on chromosome 17q21. We replicated the associations of these loci with intracranial volume in a separate sample of 1,752 elderly persons (P = 1.1 x 10(-3) for 6q22 and 1.2 x 10(-3) for 17q21). Furthermore, we also found suggestive associations of the 17q21 locus with head circumference in 10,768 children (mean age of 14.5 months). Our data identify two loci associated with head size, with the inversion at 17q21 also likely to be involved in attaining maximal brain size.	[Ikram, M. Arfan; Taal, H.

Our genome-wide association study (GWAS) of dementia-free persons (n = 9,232) identified 46 SNPs at four loci with P values of < 4.0 x 10(-7). In two additional samples (n = 2,318), associations were replicated at 12q14 within MSRB3-WIF1 (discovery and replication; rs17178006; P = 5.3 x 10(-11)) and at 12q24 near HRK-FBXW8 (rs7294919; P = 2.9 x 10(-11)). Remaining associations included one SNP at 2q24 within DPP4 (rs6741949; P = 2.9 x 10(-7)) and nine SNPs at 9p33 within ASTN2 (rs7852872; P = 1.0 x 10(-7)); along with the chromosome 12 associations, these loci were also associated with hippocampal volume (P < 0.05) in a third younger, more heterogeneous sample (n = 7,794). The SNP in ASTN2 also showed suggestive association with decline in cognition in a largely independent sample (n = 1,563). These associations implicate genes related to apoptosis (HRK), development (WIF1), oxidative stress (MSR3B), ubiquitination (FBXW8) and neuronal migration (ASTN2), as well as enzymes targeted by new diabetes medications (DPP4), indicating new genetic influences on hippocampal size and possibly the risk of cognitive decline and dementia.

The volume of the hippocampus is a biomarker of incipient Alzheimer's disease(1,2) and is reduced in schizophrenia(3), major depression(4) and mesial temporal lobe epilepsy(5). Whereas many brain imaging phenotypes are highly heritable(6,7), identifying and replicating genetic influences has been difficult, as small effects and the high costs of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have led to underpowered studies. Here we report genome-wide association meta-analyses and replication for mean bilateral hippocampal, total brain and intracranial volumes from a large multinational consortium. The intergenic variant rs7294919 was associated with hippocampal volume (12q24.22; N = 21,151; P = 6.70 x 10(-16)) and the expression levels of the positional candidate gene TESC in brain tissue. Additionally, rs10784502, located within HMGA2, was associated with intracranial volume (12q14.3; N = 15,782; P = 1.12 x 10(-12)). We also identified a suggestive association with total brain volume at rs10494373 within DDR2 (1q23.3; N = 6,500; P = 5.81 x 10(-7)).

ADNI was launched in 2003 by the NIA, the NIBIB, the FDA, private pharmaceutical companies and nonprofit organizations as a 5-year public-private partnership. The primary goal of ADNI has been to test whether serial MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), other biological markers and clinical and neuropsychological assessments can be combined to measure the progression of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early Alzheimer's disease. Determination of sensitive and specific markers of very early Alzheimer's disease progression is intended to aid researchers and clinicians in developing new treatments and monitoring their effectiveness, as well as lessening the time and cost of clinical trials. The Principal Investigator of this initiative is M. W. Weiner. ADNI is the result of efforts of many coinvestigators from a broad range of academic institutions and private corporations, and subjects have been recruited from over 50 sites across the United States and Canada. The initial goal of ADNI was to recruit 800 adults ages 55 to 90 to participate in the research-approximately 200 cognitively normal older individuals to be followed for 3 years, 400 people with MCI to be followed for 3 years and 200 people with early Alzheimer's disease to be followed for 2 years.

This sometimes results in severe muscular paralysis requiring mechanical ventilation to sustain the child's life. The onset of SMA type 1, the most severe form of the disease, is during the first year of life. These children become severely paralysed, but retain their intellectual capacity. Ethical concerns arise when mechanical ventilation becomes necessary for survival. When professionals assess the resulting life for the child and family, they sometimes fear it will result in unreasonably excessive care. The aim of this article is to present an analysis of ethical arguments that could support or oppose the provision of invasive ventilation in this population. This examination is particularly relevant as France is one of the few countries performing tracheotomies and mechanical ventilation for this condition.

Finely tuned mechanisms exist to match food intake to caloric expenditure. However, faced with abundant inexpensive and calorie-dense foods, many humans (and perhaps most) have a tendency to consume beyond their caloric needs. The brain controls food intake by sensing internal energy-balance signals and external cues of food availability, and by controlling feeding behavior; it is therefore at the centre of the obesity problem. This article reviews the recent use of functional brain imaging in humans to study the neural control of appetite, and how the neural systems involved may cause vulnerability to overeating in the obesogenic environment.

Methods: This was a secondary analysis of data collected in a survey of key informants (chief physicians and head nurses) in EDs in Quebec on the organization of services for community-dwelling seniors discharged to the community. Organizational characteristics were classified a priori in the following three categories: 1) availability of human resources, 2) care processes, and 3) links to community services. A multifactorial analysis (MFA) was used to analyze the variables by category and globally, thus investigating not only the relationships between variables within each category, but also the relationships between different categories. The authors then proceeded to classify EDs using Ward's method (hierarchical ascendant classification) applied to reduced data dimensions. Results: The sample consisted of 103 EDs. Analyses were carried out on data from the 68 (66%) of these EDs that supplied complete data. These 68 EDs did not differ in terms of their size or geographical location from the 35 other departments that supplied incomplete or no data. We identified three groups of EDs: most specialized (with regard to internal staff and care processes) and less community-oriented (n = 12), moderately specialized and less community-oriented (n = 28), and least specialized and more community-oriented (n = 28). Conclusions: This classification of EDs with respect to their organization of services for community-welling seniors may be helpful to those planning services, to decision-makers, and to researchers. The three groups of EDs identified in this study represent three types of organizations with differing assets and limitations. The generalizability of these groups to other settings and the implications for patient outcomes should be investigated.

Novel FUS Deletion in a Patient With Juvenile Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis	ARCHIVES OF NEUROLOGY			English	Article							MUTATIONS; GENE; RISK; ALS	Background: Juvenile amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (JALS) refers to a form of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in which a progressive upper and lower motor neuron degeneration begins before 25 years of age. It is generally associated with slow disease progression. During the past decade, a number of genes have been reported to cause JALS. Mutations in the ALSIN gene cause JALS type 2 (ALS2) as well as juvenile primary lateral sclerosis and infantile-onset ascending spastic paralysis. Mutations in the SETX gene can also sometimes lead to JALS. Conversely, mutations in SOD1, TARDBP, and FUS typically cause pure ALS, with adult onset between 46 and 56 years of age and usually rapid progression over 3 to 5 years. Recently, a few mutations in FUS have been associated with juvenile-onset of ALS characterized by a very rapid progression. Objective: To investigate the genetics of a patient with juvenile-onset ALS. Design and Patient: We sequenced all the coding exons of SOD1, TARDBP, and FUS in a 19-year-old patient experiencing rapid degeneration of upper and lower motor neurons. Results: A novel 1-base pair deletion was detected in exon 14 of the FUS gene, leading to a frameshift and the integration of 33 new amino acids. The variant p. R495QfsX527 is located in the highly conserved, extreme C terminal of the FUS protein, where most of the mutations in FUS have been identified. The variant was also identified in the unaffected 47-year-old mother of the patient, who remains asymptomatic. Conclusions: Our finding, along with other research, further confirms that FUS mutations can lead to an early-onset malignant form of ALS. In addition, our data lend additional support to the notion that disruption of the conserved C terminal of FUS is critical for developing ALS.

The pharmacological profile of atypical antipsychotics suggests that serotonergic and/or adrenergic receptors might contribute to these reported differences. In order to test this possibility, we examined the abilities of serotonin 5-HT1A and 5 HT2A/2C, and alpha(1)- and alpha(2)-adrenergic receptor drugs to modify the pattern of Nur77 (NR4A1) and Nor-1 (NR4A3) mRNA expression induced by haloperidol. Various groups of mice were treated with either saline, DOI, a 5-HT2A/2C agonist, MDL11939, a 5-HT2A antagonist, 8-OH-DPAT, a 5-HT1A agonist, prazosin, an alpha(1)-adrenergic antagonist and idazoxan, an alpha(2)-adrenergic antagonist, alone or in combination with haloperidol. The 5-HT2A/2C agonist DOI alone significantly increased Nur77 expression in the medial striatum and nucleus accumbens. DOI reduced Nor-1 expression, while MDL11939 increased the expression of this transcript in the cortex. Prazosin reduced Nur77 expression in the dorsal striatum and nucleus accumbens. Interestingly, 8-OH-DPAT and MDL11939 partially prevented haloperidol-induced Nur77 up-regulation, while MDL11939 completely abolished Nor-1 expression in the striatum. In addition, MDL11939 decreased haloperidol-induced Nur77 and Nor-1 mRNA levels in the ventral tegmental area. On the contrary, idazoxan (alpha(2) antagonist) consistently potentiated haloperidol-induced Nur77, but not Nor-1 mRNA levels in the striatum, whereas prazosin (alpha(1) antagonist) remained without effect. Taken together, these results show the ability of a 5-HT1A agonist or a 5-HT2A antagonist to reduce haloperidol-induced Nur77 and Nor-1 striatal expression, suggesting that these serotonin receptor subtypes participate in the differential pattern of gene expression induced by typical and atypical antipsychotic drugs.

Although CLN5 localizes to the lysosomal compartment, its function remains unknown. We have uncovered an interaction between CLN5 and sortilin, the lysosomal sorting receptor. However, CLN5, unlike prosaposin, does not require sortilin to localize to the lysosomal compartment. We demonstrate that in CLN5-depleted HeLa cells, the lysosomal sorting receptors sortilin and cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor (CI-MPR) are degraded in lysosomes due to a defect in recruitment of the retromer (an endosome-to-Golgi compartment trafficking component). In addition, we show that the retromer recruitment machinery is also affected by CLN5 depletion, as we found less loaded Rab7, which is required to recruit retromer. Taken together, our results support a role for CLN5 in controlling the itinerary of the lysosomal sorting receptors by regulating retromer recruitment at the endosome.

In this paper, the effects of delays on the oscillatory properties of a neural ring networks model are considered. The existence of oscillations for a specific type of recurrent neural network with time delays between neural interconnections is investigated. By using Chafee's closed orbit theory, some sufficient conditions for permanent oscillations are obtained. Simple and practical criteria for selecting the range of parameters in this network model are also derived. Among other things, the solutions that we provide can be applied to various activation functions. A few computer simulations are presented to support our analysis. The present study can be applied to analyze under which conditions a ring network could be exploited as an oscillatory pattern generator. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Deleted in colorectal cancer (DCC), a receptor for the guidance cue netrin-1, plays a pivotal role in organizing neuronal circuitry by guiding growing axons and dendrites to their correct targets and by influencing synaptic connectivity. Results from experiments we previously conducted in dcc-heterozygous mice show that DCC plays a critical role in the developmental organization of the mesocorticolimbic dopamine (DA) circuitry. Furthermore we have shown that reduced expression of DCC during development and/or throughout life confers resilience to the development of schizophrenia-like DA and behavioural abnormalities. Importantly, this "protective" phenotype only emerges after puberty. Here we assess whether DCC may contribute to the risk of schizophrenia. We examined single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located in the DCC gene for association with schizophrenia using a case-control sample consisting of 556 unrelated schizophrenic patients and 208 healthy controls. We found one SNP, rs2270954, to be nominally associated with schizophrenia; patients were less likely to be heterozygous at this locus and more likely to be homozygous for the minor allele (chi(2) = 9.84, df = 2, nominal p = 0.0071). Intriguingly, this SNP is located within the 3' untranslated region, an area known to contain a number of regulatory sequences that determine the stability and translation efficacy of mRNA. These results, together with our previous findings from studies in rodents, point at DCC as a promising novel candidate gene that may contribute to the genetic basis behind individual differences in susceptibility to schizophrenia.

A recent study conducted by our research group has provided evidence for hippocampal pathology in association with overconfidence in a first-episode psychosis sample. The fornix is the primary efferent neural pathway of the hippocampus and may also play a role in self-certainty pathophysiology. The current investigation applied diffusion tensor imaging tractography to a first-episode psychosis sample to explore whether integrity of the fornix is associated with self-certainty. High resolution structural magnetic resonance and diffusion tensor images were obtained in 44 people with a first-episode psychosis. Diffusion tensor imaging tractography was used to estimate fractional anisotrophy (FA), a measure of white matter integrity, in the fornix. Confidence in beliefs and judgments was measured with the self-certainty subscale of the Beck Cognitive Insight Scale (BCIS). The analysis showed that self-certainty significantly correlated to FA values in the right fornix but was nonsignificant for the left fornix. The findings indicate anatomical dysconnectivity of the right fornix in correlation with BCIS-rated self-certainty in our first-episode psychosis sample. When considered with our previously published self-certainty-hippocampus result in a first-episode psychosis sample, overlapping with that of this study, the results indicate a concurrence of volumetric reductions in hippocampus and fornix pathology in correlation with self-certainty.

Comparing three screening tools for drug-induced parkinsonism in patients with advanced schizophrenia: A pilot study	SCHIZOPHRENIA RESEARCH			English	Article						Antipsychotic drugs; Drug-induced parkinsonism; Schizophrenia; Parkinson's disease	NEUROLEPTIC-INDUCED PARKINSONISM; DISEASE; QUESTIONNAIRE; CLOZAPINE; DIAGNOSIS; THERAPY; DOPA	Background: Drug-induced parkinsonism (DIP) is seen in one third of patients exposed to antipsychotic drugs and may lead to complications related to dysphagia and falls. Aside from skilled neurological examination, no tool has been validated to facilitate detection and follow-up. Objective: In this pilot study, three validated screening instruments were tested in an age-biased cohort of schizophrenia patients, including four items of the Liverpool University Neuroleptic Side-Effects Rating Scale (LUNSERS) and two brief questionnaires designed for community survey of parkinsonism. Method: Fifty-six subjects living with chronic schizophrenia between 50 and 75 years of age underwent a motor evaluation along the original Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale-section III and answered questions along the selected screening instruments, and results compared to those of 16 patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and 15 neurologically unimpaired volunteers. Odds ratios, sensitivity, specificity, and their 95% confidence intervals, were calculated. Results: All three screening instruments correctly identified the PD state and distinguished PD from healthy participants. Eighteen (32%) schizophrenic patients displayed objective motor signs of parkinsonism. A single item of the LUNSERS (shakiness) significantly distinguished DIP from DIP-free patients, with a sensitivity of 61.1% and a specificity of 83.3%. The positive predictive value was 63.5% and the negative predictive value was 81.9%. The two other screening methods showed insufficient predictive value. Conclusion: Apart from a single query on shakiness, none of the tools examined were adequate to screen for DIP in patients treated for schizophrenia. A different instrument is necessary to monitor this important adverse effect in schizophrenia. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Pitfalls in Diagnostic Gastrin Measurements	CLINICAL CHEMISTRY			English	Review							ZOLLINGER-ELLISON-SYNDROME; SERUM GASTRIN; CHOLECYSTOKININ; RADIOIMMUNOASSAY; PROGASTRIN; SULFATION; HORMONES; GLUCOSE; BIOLOGY; TUMORS	BACKGROUND: Gastrin measurements are performed primarily for the diagnosis of gastrin-producing tumors, gastrinomas, which cause the Zollinger Ellison syndrome (ZES). Gastrin circulates as several bioactive peptides, however, and the peptide pattern in gastrinoma patients often deviates from normal. Therefore, it is necessary to measure all forms of gastrin. CONTENT: Only immunoassays are useful for measurement of gastrin in plasma. The original assays were RIAs developed in research laboratories that used antibodies directed against the C terminus of gastrin peptides. Because the C-terminal tetrapeptide amide sequence constitutes the active site of gastrin peptides, these assays were well suited for gastrinoma diagnosis. More recently, however, most clinical chemistry laboratories have switched to commercial kits. Because of recent cases of kit-measured normogastrinemia in patients with ZES symptoms, the diagnostic sensitivity and analytical specificity of the available kits have been examined. The results show that gastrin kits frequently measure falsely low concentrations because they measure only a single gastrin form. Falsely high concentrations were also encountered, owing to overreactivity with O-sulfated gastrins or plasma proteins. Thus, more than half of the gastrin kits on the market are unsuited for diagnostics. SUMMARY: Gastrinomas are neuroendocrine tumors, some of which become malignant. A delay in diagnosis leads to fulminant ZES, with major, even lethal, complications. Consequently, it is necessary that the diagnostic sensitivity of gastrin kits be adequate. This diagnostic sensitivity requires antibodies that bind the C-terminal epitope of bioactive gastrins without the influence of O-sulfation.

Timely diagnosis of influenza and early recognition of an outbreak or epidemic are crucial in preventing complications, hospitalizations and deaths. Emergency departments serve as frequent points-of-entry into the healthcare system for most influenza cases, and thus well positioned to promptly identify and manage influenza. Early treatment initiated within six hours of symptom onset provides the greatest benefit. Specific infection control measures implemented by emergency departments can curb the spread of influenza in hospitals during influenza season.

Contribution of orodental status to the intensity of orofacial tardive dyskinesia: An interdisciplinary and video-based assessment	JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRIC RESEARCH			English	Article						Tardive dyskinesia; Antipsychotic drugs; Schizophrenia; Edentulism; Dental occlusion; Dental prosthesis	EDENTULOUS ORODYSKINESIA; SCHIZOPHRENIA; HEALTH	Background: Tardive dyskinesia (TD) is a neurological motor complication eventually arising in one-third of patients chronically exposed to antipsychotic drugs. Some orodental peripheral factors have been reported to influence TD. Objective: To measure orodental factors such as temporomandibular joint function, static occlusal contacts, and denture condition, and attempt correlations with orofacial TD intensity. Methods: In this exploratory cross-sectional pilot study, 31 subjects between 30 and 75 years of age were divided in two groups displaying minimal to mild, or moderate to severe orofacial TD, respectively, and underwent a detailed oral, dental, and prosthetic evaluation to capture various aspects of oral health compared between the two groups. Blinded video-based TD ratings along a validated scale were obtained to compare dentulous and edentulous subjects, and contrast TD intensity in complete denture wearers with and without their own prostheses. Results: None of the factors examined tightly correlated with orofacial TD intensity. However, edentulism was associated with a higher median orofacial TD rating compared to the dentulous group (p = 0.001). Further, a significant intra-subject difference was observed in the edentulous subjects rated with their own complete dentures in place or not (p = 0.028), the dentures attenuating the mean orofacial ratings by 21.8 +/- 7.3%. Conclusion: Of all orodental factors considered, only edentulism and complete denture wearing influenced oral TD expression, calling for the close monitoring of the dental status in antipsychotic drug-exposed patients to prevent tooth loss. Further studies to measure the impact of an adequate prosthodontic rehabilitation in edentulous subjects with orofacial TD seem warranted. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Methods: Forty-three patients with focal epilepsy were studied with EEG/fMRI using a 3-T scanner. Blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal changes related to interictal epileptic discharges (IEDs) were classified as concordant or not concordant with the scalp EEG spike field and as contributory if the BOLD signal provided additional information to the scalp EEG about the epileptic focus or not contributory if it did not. We considered patients having intracerebral EEG or a focal lesion on MRI as having independent validation. Results: Thirty-three patients had at least 3 IEDs during the EEG/fMRI acquisition (active EEG), and all had a BOLD response. In 29 of 33 (88%) patients, the BOLD response was concordant, and in 21 of 33 (64%) patients, the BOLD response was contributory. Fourteen patients had an independent validation: in 12 of these 14, the BOLD responses were validated and in 2 they were invalidated. Conclusions: A BOLD response was present in all patients with active EEG, and more specific localization of the epileptic focus was gained from EEG/fMRI in half of the patients who were scanned, when compared with scalp EEG alone. This study demonstrates that EEG/fMRI, in the context of a clinical practice, may contribute to the localization of the interictal epileptic generator in patients with focal epilepsy.

Phenotype and genotype analysis in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis with TARDBP gene mutations	NEUROLOGY			English	Article							SUPEROXIDE-DISMUTASE GENE; FAMILIAL ALS; SPORADIC ALS; ITALIAN PATIENTS; DEGENERATION; DIAGNOSIS; DISEASE; PROTEIN	Objective: To describe the phenotype and phenotype-genotype correlations in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) with TARDBP gene mutations. Methods: French TARDBP+ patients with ALS (n = 28) were compared first to 3 cohorts: 737 sporadic ALS (SALS), 192 nonmutated familial ALS (FALS), and 58 SOD1 + FALS, and then to 117 TARDBP+ cases from the literature. Genotype-phenotype correlations were studied for the most frequent TARDBP mutations. Results: In TARDBP+ patients, onset was earlier (p = 0.0003), upper limb (UL) onset was predominant (p = 0.002), and duration was longer (p = 0.0001) than in patients with SALS. TARDBP+ and SOD1+ groups had the longest duration but diverged for site of onset: 64.3% UL onset for TARDBP+ and 74.1% on lower limbs for SOD1+ (p < 0.0001). The clinical characteristics of our 28 patients were similar to the 117 cases from the literature. In Caucasians, 51.3% of had UL onset, while 58.8% of Asians had bulbar onset (p = 0.02). The type of mutation influenced survival (p < 0.0001), and the G298S1, lying in the TARDBP super rich glycine-residue domain, was associated with the worst survival (27 months). Conclusion: Differences in phenotype between the groups as well as the differential influence of TARBDP mutations on survival may help physicians in ALS management and allow refining the strategy of genetic diagnosis.

Elevation of SSAO activity is linked to vascular disorders associated with pathological conditions such as diabetic complications, heart failure and vascular dementia. In the present paper, a high performance liquid chromatography electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-MS) method is developed to determine the SSAO activity. Methylamine is used as physiological substrate for the enzyme activity assay of SSAO. Formaldehyde, the enzymatic reaction product, was derivatized by dopamine, and separated by a silica-based pentafluorophenyl column. The calibration curve was linear over the range of 0.03-4.00 mu M of formaldehyde concentration, with 0.03 mu M the lower limit of quantification (LOQ). The inter-day and intra-day precisions ranged from 2.2% to 7.9% and 4.4% to 9.2% respectively for each quality control sample of formaldehyde at 0.06, 0.50, and 2.00 mu M. The accuracy ranged from 96.0% to 111.5%. The limit of detection (LOD) for serum SSAO activity was 1 nmol h(-1) mg(-1) protein. The method was successfully applied for the determination of SSAO activity in both mouse serum and rat tissues. SSAO activity of the serum in diabetes mice was significantly increased compared with the control and was inhibited by 2-bromoethylamine in vivo. The levels of SSAO activity in rat lung, spleen, aorta, kidney and brain tissues were significantly decreased by semicarbazide in vitro.

This study investigated whether the timing of mitral valve (MV) repair or surgical approach affects outcomes in patients with MV regurgitation. Methods. Between 1992 and 2009, 2,255 patients underwent MV operations, including 1,305 with isolated MV regurgitation operations (1,054 repairs, 251 replacements). Surgical approaches were sternotomy in 377, video-assisted right minithoracotomy in 481, or robot-assisted in 447. Mean follow-up was 6.4 +/- 4.5 years (maximum, 19 years). Results. Sternotomy MV repairs decreased during the study while minimally invasive MV repairs increased. Robotic MV repair patients were younger, with fewer women, had better left ventricular ejection fractions, and were more likely to have myxomatous degeneration (all p < 0.001). The robotic approach led to a higher MV repair rate and increased use of leaflet/chordal procedures but had longer cardiopulmonary bypass and aortic cross-clamp times (all p < 0.001). The 30-day mortality for isolated MV repair was similar for all approaches (p = 0.409). Fewer neurological events were observed in the videoscopic and robotic groups (p = 0.013). Adjusted survival was similar for all approaches (p = 0.357). Survival in patients in New York Heart Association class I to II with myxomatous degeneration or annular dilatation was similar to a matched population but was worse for patients in class III to IV or undergoing MV replacement. Conclusions. MV repair in patients with severe MV regurgitation should be performed before New York Heart Association class III to IV symptoms develop. Minimally invasive MV repair techniques render similar outcomes as the sternotomy approach. (Ann Thorac Surg 2012;93:1462-8) (c) 2012 by The Society of Thoracic Surgeons	[Chitwood, W.

Antiglycation activity of Vaccinium spp. (Ericaceae) from the Sam Vander Kloet collection for the treatment of type II diabetes	BOTANY-BOTANIQUE			English	Article						diabetes; advanced glycation endproduct; Vaccinium; Indigenous Peoples; Ericaceae	GLYCATION; PLANTS; EXTRACTS; ANGUSTIFOLIUM; HERZEGOVINA; BOSNIA; QUEBEC; CANADA; LEAF	In this report, the inhibition of advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs) by extracts of leaves from a collection of six, mainly tropical, Vaccinium L. spp. (Ericaceae) was examined. Indigenous Peoples have used Vaccinium species to treat symptoms of type I and II diabetes. Sustained hyperglycaemia, often associated with diabetes, facilitates crosslinking of sugars with proteins, producing AGEs. AGEs are a therapeutic target since they are responsible for many diabetes symptoms and contribute to ageing and the development of atherosclerosis, kidney, vascular, and neurological diseases. Vaccinium barandanum S. Vidal, Vaccinium consanguineum Klotzsch, Vaccinium gaultheriifolium (Griff.) Hook. f. ex C.B. Clarke, Vaccinium poasanum Donn. Sm., Vaccinium tonkinense Dop, and Disterigma rimbachii (A.C. Sm.) Luteyn (outgroup) were collected from Sam Vander Kloet's common garden collection. Ethanolic extracts of leaves of these Vaccinium spp. were potent inhibitors of AGEs. Vaccinium and outgroup species extracts tested in an AGE inhibition assay demonstrated concentration dependent inhibition, with a half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) ranging from 4.2 to 16.2 mu g.mL(-1). Phenolic content ranged from 258 to 626 (mu g quercetin equivalents.mg extract(-1)). Activity and phenolic content show that these tropical accessions have a higher phenolic content (p < 0.001, t test) and AGE inhibition (p < 0.03, t test) than six temperate species from our collections in eastern North America. Significant relationships were found between IC50 and latitude of geographic origin.

Yet, their clinical manifestations seem to resemble each other. We seek to determine how to detect PD dyskinesia and HD chorea during quiet stance using healthy control subjects' postural sway as a base measure and identify means to distinguish mathematically HD chorea from PD dyskinesia. Movements were recorded using a magnetic tracker system with fifteen sensors placed strategically to capture whole-body displacement. Choreic and dyskinetic patients as well as healthy controls were asked to stand with arms stretched horizontally in front of them for 60 s. We examined amplitude, frequency dispersion, proportional energy, sample entropy, kurtosis, skewness, amplitude fluctuation, maximum coherency between 44 pairs of body segments. The choreic and dyskinetic movements revealed similar patterns of sample entropy, amplitude fluctuation, and coherencies between body segments. However, skewness and kurtosis for velocity of movements were found to be higher in HD chorea than in PD dyskinesia, reflecting rapid movements in HD patients. There was also a tendency for the frequency composition of PD dyskinesia to be more concentrated in the 1.0-1.5 Hz range. Our results show that despite their similarities in apparent randomness and lack of coordination, dyskinesia associated with treatment of PD and chorea in HD each have their own distinctive characteristics which may be related to their specific pathophysiology.

Compared to other algorithms that are commonly used for mixture models (such as expectation-maximization), our approach has several advantages: first, the problem of over-fitting is prevented; furthermore, the complexity of the mixture model (i.e., the number of components) can be determined automatically and simultaneously with the parameters estimation as part of the Bayesian inference procedure; finally, since the whole inference process is analytically tractable with closed-form solutions, it may scale well to large applications. Both synthetic and real data, generated from real-life challenging applications namely image databases categorization and anomaly intrusion detection, are experimented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Although endothelial nitric oxide and cholinoceptive GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) interneurons have been implicated, little is known about the role of pyramidal cells in this response and their possible interaction with astrocytes. Using c-Fos immunohistochemistry as a marker of neuronal activation and laser-Doppler flowmetry, we measured changes in CBF evoked by BF stimulation following pharmacological blockade of c-Fos-identified excitatory pathways, astroglial metabolism, or vasoactive mediators. Pyramidal cells including those that express cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) displayed c-Fos upregulation. Glutamate acting via NMDA, AMPA, and mGlu receptors was involved in the evoked CBF response, NMDA receptors having the highest contribution (similar to 33%). In contrast, nonselective and selective COX-2 inhibition did not affect the evoked CBF response (+0.4% to 6.9%, ns). The metabolic gliotoxins fluorocitrate and fluoroacetate, the cytochrome P450 epoxygenase inhibitor MS-PPOH and the selective epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) antagonist 14,15-epoxyeicosa-5(Z)-enoic acid (14,15-EEZE) all blocked the evoked CBF response by similar to 50%. Together, the data demonstrate that the hyperemic response to BF stimulation is largely mediated by glutamate released from activated pyramidal cells and by vasoactive EETs, likely originating from activated astrocytes.

Stability of gait and interlimb coordination in older adults. J Neurophysiol 107: 2560-2569, 2012. First published February 1, 2012; doi:10.1152/jn.00950.2011.-Most falls in older adults occur when walking, specifically following a trip. This study investigated the short-and longer term responses of young (n = 24, 27.6 +/- 4.5 yr) and older adults (n = 18, 69.1 +/- 4.2 yr) to a trip during gait at comfortable speed and the role of interlimb coordination in recovery from tripping. Subjects walked on a self-paced treadmill when forward movement of their dominant leg was unexpectedly arrested for 250 ms. Recovery of center of mass (COM) movements and of double-support duration following perturbation was determined. In addition, the disruption and recovery of interlimb coordination of the arms and legs was evaluated. Although young and older subjects used similar lower limb strategies in response to the trip, older adults had less stable COM movement patterns before perturbation, had longer transient destabilization (>25%) after perturbation, required more gait cycles to recover double-support duration (older, 3.48 +/- 0.7 cycles; young, 2.88 +/- 0.4 cycles), and had larger phase shifts that persisted after perturbation (older, -83 degrees to -90 degrees; young, -39 degrees to -42 degrees). Older adults also had larger disruptions to interlimb coordination of the arms and legs. The timing of the initial disruption in coordination was correlated with the disturbance in gait stability only in young adults. In older adults, greater initial COM instability was related to greater longer term arm incoordination. These results suggest a relationship between interlimb coordination and gait stability, which may be associated with fall risk in older adults. Reduced coordination and gait stability suggest a need for stability-related functional training even in high-functioning older adults.	[Krasovsky, T.; Banina, M.

While memory problems in children with MS are often reported, little is known about the neural correlates that may contribute to these difficulties. We measured verbal and nonverbal memory using the Test of Memory and Learning (TOMAL-2) in 32 children and adolescents with MS and 26 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Memory performance was correlated with volumetric measures of the whole brain, hippocampus, amygdala, and thalamus. Brain volumes were normalized for age and sex using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data from the National Institutes of Health MRI Study of Normal Brain development. With the exception of story recall, performance on memory tests was similar to that of the control group. Relative to controls, patient with MS showed reduced volume in the whole brain (p < .001), amygdala (p < .005), and thalamus (p < .001), but not the hippocampus. In the patient group, word-list learning correlated with whole brain volume (r = .53) and hippocampal volume (r = .43), whereas visual recognition memory correlated with thalamic volume (r = .48). Findings are consistent with the well-established role of the hippocampus in learning and consolidation and also highlight the importance of diffuse brain pathology on memory function.

Although aMCI is typically conceptualized as involving predominantly deficits in episodic memory, recent studies have demonstrated that deficits in executive functioning may also be present, and thorough categorization of cognitive functioning in MCI may improve early diagnosis and treatment of AD. We first provide an extensive review of neuropsychology studies that examined executive functioning in MCI. We then present data on executive functioning across multiple sub-domains (divided attention, working memory, inhibitory control, verbal fluency, and planning) in 40 aMCI patients (single or multiple domain) and 32 normal elderly controls (NECs). MCI patients performed significantly worse than NECs in all 5 sub-domains, and there was impairment (> 1.0 SD below the mean of NECs) in all sub-domains. Impairment on each test was frequent, with 100% of MCI patients exhibiting a deficit in at least one sub-domain of executive functioning. Inhibitory control was the most frequently and severely impaired. These results indicate that executive dysfunction in multiple sub-domains is common in WO and highlights the importance of a comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation for fully characterizing the nature and extent of cognitive deficits in MCI.

CANDLE is designed to be robust for low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions typically encountered when imaging deep in scattering biological specimens. Based on an optimized non-local means filter involving the comparison of filtered patches. CANDLE locally adapts the amount of smoothing in order to deal with the noise inhomogeneity inherent to laser scanning fluorescence microscopy images. An extensive validation on synthetic data, images acquired on microspheres and in vivo images is presented. These experiments show that the CANDLE filter obtained competitive results compared to a state-of-the-art method and a locally adaptive optimized non-local means filter, especially under low SNR conditions (PSNR < 8 dB). Finally, the deeper imaging capabilities enabled by the proposed filter are demonstrated on deep tissue in vivo images of neurons and fine axonal processes in the Xenopus tadpole brain.

Methods: A cluster-sampled national survey of the adult household-based Liberian population. Findings: Former combatants with reported head injury were more likely to experience major depressive disorder symptoms, suicidal ideation and attempts, and current substance abuse. Former combatants with head injury are 2.83 times more likely to have major depressive disorder symptoms, and those with suspected traumatic brain injury are five times more likely to have post-traumatic stress disorder. Interpretation: The poor mental health of former combatants in Liberia, both child and adult, might be mitigated if Disarmament, Demobilization, and Reintegration programming assessed participants for head trauma and traumatic brain injury using simple screening methods. The specific health and mental health needs of ex-combatants-a highly vulnerable group-will need to be addressed by Liberia. If left untreated, ex-combatants with high rates of suicidal ideation and post-traumatic stress disorder might be susceptible to re-recruitment into new conflicts in the region.

Neuronal differentiation is a complex process which involves many signaling pathways and molecular mechanisms. Interestingly, recent studies indicate that the FoxO family is involved in a number of signaling pathways regulating cell differentiation. The actions occur at different stages in the differentiation process and by differing mechanisms. This review will focus on FoxO as a novel transcription factor in neural differentiation.

Immunologic evaluations of affected patients often reveal anomalies of humoral and cell-mediated immunity. We describe a case of ataxia-telangiectasia with an atypical immunodeficiency and a novel mutation in the ATM gene. The patient presented at age 3 years with a perineal cellulitis associated with profound neutropenia and T-cell lymphopenia. Serum immunoglobulin levels and antibody titers were normal. Neurologic evaluation revealed minimal hypotonia and wide-based gait, without other signs of cerebellar dysfunction. The alpha-fetoprotein level was elevated, and molecular genetic testing confirmed the diagnosis of ataxia-telangiectasia, uncovering a novel ATM gene mutation c.3931C>T (p.GIn1311X) in exon 28. This patient presents a unique immunologic pattern with normal immunoglobulin levels, significant lymphopenia, and profound neutropenia. The diagnosis of ataxia-telangiectasia should be considered in children presenting with gait disorder and immunologic defects, regardless of subtype and severity. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Cache Cty Investigators	Prevalence of Neuropsychiatric Symptoms in CIND and Its Subtypes: The Cache County Study	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF GERIATRIC PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						Agitation; anxiety; CIND; cache county; dementia; depression; MCI; NPI; NPS	MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; ALZHEIMER-DISEASE; NO DEMENTIA; PROSPECTIVE COHORT; HEALTH; QUESTIONNAIRE; PROGRESSION; INCREASES; RISK; AGE	Objectives: 1) To report rates of neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) in cognitive impairment, no dementia (CIND). 2) To compare the 30-day prevalence of NPS in CIND with that in dementia and cognitively normal individuals. 3) To compare the prevalence of NPS in amnestic MCI (aMCI) with other predementia syndromes. Design: Comparison of prevalence proportions among several defined groups. Setting: Population-based study. Participants: A subsample of the permanent residents of Cache County, Utah, aged 65 years or older in January 1995 (N = 5092) and who had completed clinical assessments and had an informant-completed Neuropsychiatric Inventory. Measurements: Chi-square statistics, tests for trend, and logistic regression models were used to analyze the three objectives listed earlier. Results: The most prevalent NPS in those with CIND were depression (16.9%), irritability (9.8%), nighttime behaviors (7.6%), apathy (6.9%), and anxiety (5.4%). Trend analyses confirmed that the CIND group had NPS prevalence rates that fell between the normal and dementia groups for most NPS. Logistic regression models showed no significant difference between aMCI and other CIND participants in the prevalence of any NPS (lowest p: 0.316). Conclusions: These data confirm the relatively high prevalence of NPS in CIND reported by other studies, especially for affective symptoms. No differences in NPS prevalence were found between aMCI and other types of CIND.

Among the available procedures, the intracarotid amobarbital test (IAT) was formerly the most widely used. However, this procedure has many limitations: it is invasive and potentially traumatic, especially for children. To overcome these limitations, neuroimaging techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) have been used. Again, these methods are difficult to use with children, who must remain motionless during data acquisition. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a noninvasive functional imaging technique that is easily applied to pediatric and cognitively limited patients. It has been used recently in epileptic children for presurgical assessment of expressive and receptive language brain lateralization. The aim of this review is to present the contribution of fNIRS to the presurgical assessment of language function in children with neurological diseases. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Research on syntactic processing in bilinguals has used a variety of techniques, including mainly functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and event-related potentials (ERP). This paper reports on a functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) study on syntactic processing in highly proficient young adult speakers of Portuguese (mother tongue) (L1) and French (second language) (L2). They made a syntactic judgment of visually presented sentences, which either did or did not contain noun-verb agreement violations. The results showed that syntactic processing in both languages resulted in significant activation in anterior frontal regions of the left hemisphere and in the temporal superior posterior areas of the right hemisphere, with a more prominent activation for L2 in some areas. These findings corroborate previously reported neuroimaging evidence, showing the suitability of fNIRS for the study of syntactic processing in the bilingual brain. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Several neuroimaging studies have shown an age-related reduction in hemispheric asymmetry on various cognitive tasks, a phenomenon captured by Cabeza (2002) in the Hemispheric Asymmetry Reduction in Older Adults (HAROLD) model. Although this phenomenon is supported by a range of neuroimaging data on memory and inhibitory processes, there is little evidence concerning changes in hemispheric asymmetry for language processing, and particularly word retrieval, which is assessed with verbal fluency task (VFT). This study aimed to investigate the age-related changes in cerebral oxygenation in the prefrontal cortex for both letter and category VFT, varying the complexity of the criteria (i.e., degree of productivity) and using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). Sixteen younger and 16 older adults participated in this study. For both VF conditions, participants were instructed to pronounce as many nouns as possible as a function of high-productivity (e.g., "animals" or "L") or low-productivity (e.g., "flowers" or "V") criteria. Behavioral data (i.e., accuracy responses) showed comparable performance in younger and older adults for both VF conditions. However, NIRS data showed more reduced activation (i.e., significantly reduced increase in [O(2)Hb] and reduced decrease in [HHb]) in older than younger adults for both VFT. In addition, a bilateral effect was found for both groups, suggesting that VFT requires both executive and language functions. The results are discussed in the context of the current theories of aging. (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Inc.

The goal of this study was to explore the neurofunctional changes associated with aging for different components of narrative discourse. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and behavioral data on 10 younger adults and 10 healthy elderly participants were collected. Ten younger adults in a non-proficient second language condition were included to explore the possibility that the age-related neurofunctional reorganization partly expresses demanding resource allocation. Results show within- and across-hemispheric differences in the neurofunctional pattern of activation in the older participants with reference to the younger ones, partially shared with the low-proficiency young adults, providing support for the recognized mechanisms underlying neural reserve and compensation. fNIRS was shown to be appropriate for studying the age-related neurofunctional reorganization of complex cognitive abilities.

Survey of determination of death after cardiac arrest by intensive care physicians	CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE			English	Article						autoresuscitation; cardiac arrest; determination of death; donation after cardiocirculatory death; intensive care; organ donation	BRAIN-DEATH; LAZARUS PHENOMENON; ORGAN DONATION; RESUSCITATION; VARIABILITY; CESSATION; DONOR	Objective: The controversy regarding death determination in the context of organ donation after cardiocirculatory death requires investigation. We sought to describe the manner in which Canadian adult and pediatric intensive care physicians report death determination after cardiac arrest. Design: Pilot-tested paper survey. Setting: Mail out between June and November 2009. Subjects: Canadian adult and pediatric intensive care physicians. Intervention: Paper-based survey. Main Results: Forty-nine percent of 501 Canadian intensive care physicians responded. Eighty-five percent practiced in tertiary care, university-affiliated centers, and 26% were from pediatric centers. Physicians had a median of 10 yrs (range 0-35) experience. Physicians reported that they performed determination of death after cardiac arrest a median of seven (range 0-60) times per year. Of 11 tests or procedures used, the absence of heart sounds by auscultation, palpable pulse, and breath sounds were the most common, although there was high variability in practice. No diagnostic test/procedure was uniformly performed or omitted. Sixty-five percent of respondents believed autoresuscitation exists and 37% of physicians reported to have seen a possible case during their career. Forty-eight percent had formal training for determining death after cardiac arrest and 22% used guidelines. The majority of respondents agreed that standardized methods for determination of death after cardiac arrest are required in general (69%) and specifically for donation after cardiocirculatory death (91%). Conclusions: Intensive care physicians in Canada report: 1) variability in the practice of determining death after cardiac arrest; 2) the existence of autoresuscitation; and 3) a need for standardization of practice. The results of this survey support the need to develop more robust education, guidelines, and standards for the determination of death after cardiac arrest, in general, as well as within the context of donation after cardiocirculatory death.

Thalamus and cerebral cortex are the brain areas that have attracted most of the attention from both clinical and experimental researchers. However, these studies have often favored either one or the other structure in playing a major role, thus leading to conflicting interpretations. Beginning with Jasper and Penfields topistic view of absence seizures as the result of abnormal functions in the so-called centrencephalon, we witness the naissance of a broader concept that considered both thalamus and cortex as equal players in the process of SW discharge generation. Furthermore, we discuss how recent studies have identified fine changes in cortical and thalamic excitability that may account for the expression of absence seizures in naturally occurring genetic rodent models and knockout mice. The end of this fascinating tale is presumably far from being written. However, I can confidently conclude that in the unfolding of this novel, we have discovered several molecular, cellular, and pharmacologic mechanisms that govern forebrain excitability, and thus consciousness, during the awake state and sleep.

These HFOs have been defined as events that stand out from the background. We have noticed that this background often consists itself of high-frequency rhythmic activity. The purpose of this study is to perform a first evaluation of the characteristics of high-frequency continuous or semicontinuous background activity. Methods: Because the continuous high-frequency pattern was noted mainly in mesial temporal structures, we reviewed the EEG studies from these structures in 24 unselected patients with electrodes implanted in these regions. Sections of background away from interictal spikes were marked visually during periods of slow-wave sleep and wakefulness. They were then high-passed filtered at 80 Hz and categorized as having high-frequency rhythmic activity in one of three patterns: continuous/semicontinuous, irregular, sporadic. Wavelet entropy, which measures the degree of rhythmicity of a signal, was calculated for the marked background sections. Key Findings: Ninety-six bipolar channels were analyzed. The continuous/semicontinuous pattern was found frequently (29/96 channels during wake and 34/96 during sleep). The different patterns were consistent between sleep and wakefulness. The continuous/semicontinuous pattern was found significantly more often in the hippocampus than in the parahippocampal gyrus and was rarely found in the amygdala. The types of pattern were not influenced by whether a channel was within the seizure-onset zone, or whether it was a lesional channel. The continuous/semicontinuous pattern was associated with a higher frequency of spikes and with high rates of ripples and fast ripples. Significance: It appears that high-frequency activity (above 80 Hz) does not appear only in the form of brief paroxysmal events but also in the form of continuous rhythmic activity or very long bursts. In this study limited to mesial temporal structures, we found a clear anatomic preference for the hippocampus. Although associated with spikes and with distinct HFOs, this pattern was not clearly associated with the seizure-onset zone. Future studies will need to evaluate systematically the presence of this pattern, as it may have a pathophysiologic significance and it will also have an important influence on the very definition of HFOs.

Nicotine metabolism, mediated by the enzyme CYP2A6, also influences smoking behavior. In this study, we investigated how nicotine metabolism and genetic variation in CYP2A6 influence the neural response to smoking cues in humans using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We hypothesized that individuals with faster rates of nicotine metabolism would have stronger conditioned responses to smoking cues because of closer coupling in everyday life between exposure to cigarettes and surges in blood nicotine concentration. In contrast, individuals with reduced rates of metabolism, who have relatively constant nicotine blood levels throughout the day, should be less likely to develop conditioned responses to cues. We screened 169 smokers for their rate of nicotine metabolism and CYP2A6 genotype, and selected 31 smokers with the fastest and slowest rates for fMRI, matched for daily cigarette intake. We measured their neural response to visual smoking and non-smoking cues using fMRI. As predicted, fast metabolizers, by phenotype or genotype, had significantly greater responses to visual cigarette cues than slow metabolizers in the amygdala, hippocampus, striatum, insula, and cingulate cortex. These results support the theory that drug cues are conditioned stimuli, and explain why fast metabolizers who smoke have lower cessation rates. They also provide insight into how genetics can shape human vulnerability to addiction, and have implications for tailoring smoking cessation programs based on individual genetics.

To explore the mechanisms involved, we examined whether ketanserin reversed the plasticity changes associated with calcitonin gene-related peptides (CGRP) and neuropeptide (NPY) which may reflect distinct mechanisms: involvement and compensatory protection. Behavioral responses to thermal and tactile stimuli after spinal nerve ligation (SNL) at L5 demonstrated neuropathic pain and its attenuation in the vehicle- and ketanserin-treated groups, respectively. SNL surgery induced an increase in CGRP and NPY immunoreactivity (IR) in laminae I-II of the spinal cord. 15 SNL produced an expression of NPY-IR in large, medium and small diameter neurons in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) only at 15, but not adjacent L4 and L6. Daily injection of ketanserin (0.3 mg/kg, s.c.) for two weeks suppressed the increase in CGRP-IR and NPY-IR in the spinal cord or DRG. The present study demonstrated that: (1) the expression of CGRP was enhanced in the spinal dorsal horn and NPY was expressed in the DRG containing injured neurons, but not in the adjacent DRG containing intact neurons, following L5 SNL; (2) the maladaptive changes in CGRP and NPY expression in the spinal cord and DRG mediated the bioactivity of 5-HT/5-HT2A receptors in neuropathic pain and (3) the blockade of 5-HT2A receptors by ketanserin reversed the evoked upregulation of both CGRP and NPY in the spinal cord and DRG contributing to the inhibition of neuropathic pain.

Demyelinating Diseases: Myeloperoxidase as an Imaging Biomarker and Therapeutic Target	RADIOLOGY			English	Article							EXPERIMENTAL AUTOIMMUNE ENCEPHALOMYELITIS; REMITTING MULTIPLE-SCLEROSIS; PLACEBO-CONTROLLED TRIAL; MACROPHAGE ACTIVATION; LIPID-PEROXIDATION; INTERFERON BETA-1A; WHITE-MATTER; DOUBLE-BLIND; INFLAMMATION; MICROGLIA	Purpose: To evaluate myeloperoxidase (MPO) as a newer therapeutic target and bis-5-hydroxytryptamide-diethylenetriaminepentaacetate-gadolinium (Gd) (MPO-Gd) as an imaging biomarker for demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS) by using experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a murine model of MS. Materials and Methods: Animal experiments were approved by the institutional animal care committee. EAE was induced in SJL mice by using proteolipid protein (PLP), and mice were treated with either 4-aminobenzoic acid hydrazide (ABAH), 40 mg/kg injected intraperitoneally, an irreversible inhibitor of MPO, or saline as control, and followed up to day 40 after induction. In another group of SJL mice, induction was performed without PLP as shams. The mice were imaged by using MPO-Gd to track changes in MPO activity noninvasively. Imaging results were corroborated by enzymatic assays, flow cytometry, and histopathologic analyses. Significance was computed by using the t test or Mann-Whitney U test. Results: There was a 2.5-fold increase in myeloid cell infiltration in the brain (P = .026), with a concomitant increase in brain MPO level (P = .0087). Inhibiting MPO activity with ABAH resulted in decrease in MPO-Gd-positive lesion volume (P = .012), number (P = .009), and enhancement intensity (P = .03) at MR imaging, reflecting lower local MPO activity (P = .03), compared with controls. MPO inhibition was accompanied by decreased demyelination (P = .01) and lower inflammatory cell recruitment in the brain (P < .0001), suggesting a central MPO role in inflammatory demyelination. Clinically, MPO inhibition significantly reduced the severity of clinical symptoms (P = .0001) and improved survival (P = .0051) in mice with EAE. Conclusion: MPO may be a key mediator of myeloid inflammation and tissue damage in EAE.

Neonatal Behavioral Changes in Rats With Gestational Exposure to Lipopolysaccharide: A Prenatal Infection Model for Developmental Neuropsychiatric Disorders	SCHIZOPHRENIA BULLETIN			English	Article						schizophrenia; immune activation; autism; serotonin; premorbid	NEURODEVELOPMENTAL ANIMAL-MODEL; AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDERS; ULTRASONIC VOCALIZATIONS; IMMUNE ACTIVATION; ADULT SCHIZOPHRENIA; KNOCKOUT MICE; DOPAMINERGIC HYPERFUNCTION; MATERNAL INFLAMMATION; POSTNATAL-DEVELOPMENT; EMOTIONAL REACTIVITY	Exposure to prenatal infections has been widely associated with the increased risk for neuropsychiatric disorders of developmental origin such as schizophrenia and autism. Although several behavioral and cognitive deficits have been detected during adulthood in rodent models of prenatal infections, early behavioral changes have not been well characterized. In a prenatal lipopolysaccharide (LPS) model, we have previously observed significant alterations in the neuronal cytoarchitecture during early postnatal life. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the potential effects of prenatal immune activation on early neurophenotypic presentations using a set of behavioral test battery. Female Sprague-Dawley rats were administered with 100 mu g/kg LPS (intraperitoneally) at gestational days 15 and 16. During the first postnatal week, we found no significant effect on maternal behavior or mother-pup interaction by this treatment. Also, no major changes in physical developmental milestones of pups were noted from postnatal (P) days P6 to P16. Importantly, prenatal LPS-exposed pups had a significant decrease in the number and duration of ultrasonic vocalization calls at P3 and P5. Prenatal LPS treatment also led to impairments in nest-seeking behavior and odor-stroke associative learning in neonatal rats at P8 and P9. At the molecular level, we detected significant decrease in the expression of cortical 5HT1A and 5HT1B messenger RNA at P3. These data suggest that prenatal exposure to an immune activator can significantly impair the social/communicative behavior in the neonate offspring, which may be relevant to childhood and premorbid abnormalities reported in autism and schizophrenia subjects.

It has been proposed that these effects might be mediated by FD-induced increase in plasma levels of ghrelin, a 28-amino acid orexigenic peptide demonstrated to functionally interact with the mesolimbic dopaminergic system. However, a role for ghrelin has been demonstrated only with psychostimulant drugs and alcohol associated behaviors. We therefore examined the role of ghrelin in ongoing heroin self-administration and FD-induced reinstatement of extinguished heroin seeking. As expected, infusions of ghrelin [0.0, 1.5 and 3.0 mu g/rat, intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.)] produced increases in breakpoints on a progressive ratio schedule of heroin reinforcement. In contrast, central administration of a ghrelin receptor antagonist, [D-Lys-3]-GHRP-6 (0.0, or 20.0 mu g/rat, i.c.v.) had no effect on ongoing heroin self-administration under a fixed-ratio 1 schedule, or on FD-induced reinstatement of heroin seeking. These results suggest that signals mediated through ghrelin receptors play a limited role in FD-induced augmentation of heroin reinforcement and reinstatement of extinguished heroin seeking.

The present study examined whether parents' neuroticism predicted poor interpersonal functioning among offspring 10 years later and whether the problems observed in middle childhood mediated the association between parents' neuroticism and offspring functioning. When offspring were in middle childhood, parents completed the revised NEO Personality Inventory and rated the child's behavior on the Child Behavior Checklist. Ten years later, 65 OBD and 59 ONMD completed interviews assessing mental disorders and interpersonal and noninterpersonal functioning. High neuroticism and low agreeableness in parents predicted poor interpersonal functioning in their offspring in late adolescence-early adulthood. The offspring's externalizing and internalizing problems in middle childhood partially mediated the association between parents' personality and offspring interpersonal functioning. Moreover, the association between parents' neuroticism and offspring internalizing problems was stronger among the OBD than the ONMD. Overall, the results suggested an intergenerational transmission of risk whereby high neuroticism and low agreeableness in parents were associated with behavioral problems among offspring in middle childhood that, in turn, predicted poor interpersonal functioning 10 years later.

Neurophysiological and behavioral effects of a 60 Hz, 1,800 mu T magnetic field in humans	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Time-varying magnetic field; 60 Hz; Human; Electroencephalography; Tremor; Standing balance	FREQUENCY ELECTROMAGNETIC-FIELDS; AUTONOMIC CONTROL MECHANISMS; BRAIN ELECTRICAL-ACTIVITY; NORMAL STANDING BALANCE; HEART-RATE-VARIABILITY; DOMAIN CHARACTERISTICS; NEUROLOGICAL DEFICITS; QUANTITATIVE-ANALYSIS; PARKINSONIAN TREMORS; DYSTONIC SYNDROMES	The effects of time-varying magnetic fields (MF) on humans have been actively investigated for the past three decades. One important unanswered question is the potential for MF exposure to have acute effects on human biology. Different strategies have been used to tackle this question using various physiological, neurophysiological and behavioral indicators. For example, researchers investigating electroencephalography (EEG) have reported that extremely low frequency (ELF, < 300 Hz) MF can increase resting occipital alpha rhythm (8-12 Hz). Interestingly, other studies have demonstrated that human motricity can be modulated by ELF MF: a reduction of anteroposterior standing balance or a decrease of physiological tremor intensity have been reported as consequences of exposure. However, the main limitation in this domain lies in the lack of results replication, possibly originating from the large variety of experimental approaches employed. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the effects of a 60 Hz, 1,800 mu T MF exposure on neurophysiological (EEG) and neuromotor (standing balance, voluntary motor function, and physiological tremor) aspects in humans using a single experimental procedure. Though results from this study suggest a reduction of human standing balance with MF exposure, as well as an increase of physiological tremor amplitude within the frequency range associated with central nervous system contribution, no exposure effect appeared on other investigated parameters (e.g., EEG or voluntary motor control). These results suggest that 1 h of 60 Hz, 1,800 mu T MF exposure may modulate human involuntary motor control without being detected in the cortical electrical activity.

In both students and community adults, confirmatory factor analyses supported PS perfectionism and EC perfectionism higher-order latent factors. In relation to the revised NEO Personality Inventory, PS perfectionism was primarily related to conscientiousness and achievement striving. In contrast, EC perfectionism was primarily related to neuroticism, and lower positive emotions, trust and competence. EC perfectionism accounted for unique variance in current depressive and anxious symptoms over and above the five-factor domain scores. Copyright (c) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Although the significance of a recurrence remains unknown, they not only require angiographic follow-up but discovery sometimes leads to retreatment, with associated risks. Several strategies have been developed to decrease recurrence rates, including the addition of an endovascular stent to standard coiling. Stents may permit more complete coil occlusion, form a neointimal scaffold at the aneurysm neck and normalize blood flows. A randomized study of endovascular treatment of UIAs for aneurysms treated with or without stenting has not been performed. The design of the STenting in Aneurysm Treatments (STAT) trial is reported, which compares angiographic and clinical outcomes following endovascular treatment of UIAs with or without stents. The first phase of this pragmatic management trial will examine angiographic outcomes, in order to determine whether the addition of a stent to standard coiling can decrease recurrence rates, while the second phase of the study will determine if stenting is associated with increased patient morbidity and mortality. The STAT trial collaborators intend to enroll 600 patients, a size sufficient (at 80% power and 0.05 significance) to detect a decrease in recurrences from 33% to 20% by 1 year, and to verify that stenting does not result in an increase in the proportion of patients experiencing neurological disability (modified Rankin Scale score >2), from 6% to 12%.

CHEMICAL SENSES			English	Article						odor; taste; threshold; trigeminal	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; OLFACTORY SENSITIVITY; ODOR DISCRIMINATION; DETECTION THRESHOLD; SUBTHRESHOLD TASTE; TRIGEMINAL SYSTEMS; LIFE-SPAN; PERCEPTION; SMELL; AGE	Taste, smell, and chemical irritation (so-called trigeminal sensation) combine in our daily experience to produce the supramodal sensation of flavor, are processed by partly overlapping neural mechanisms, and show functional interconnectivity in experiments. Given their collaboration in flavor formation and the well-established connections between these senses, it is plausible that polymodal detection mechanisms might contribute to individual differences in measured sensitivity. One would expect the existence of a general chemosensory sensitivity factor to result in associations among taste, smell, and trigeminal stimulation thresholds. Measures of 5 detection thresholds from all the chemical senses were assessed in the same group of young healthy subjects (n = 57). An unbiased principal components analysis (PCA) yielded a 2-component solution. Component 1, on which taste thresholds loaded strongly, accounted for 29.4% of the total variance. Component 2, on which the odor and trigeminal lateralization thresholds loaded strongly, accounted for 26.9% of the total variance. A subsequent PCA restricted to a 3-component solution cleanly separated the 3 sensory modalities and accounted for 75% of the total variance. Thus, though there may be a common underlying factor that determines some individual differences in odor and trigeminal lateralization thresholds, a general chemical sensitivity that spans chemosensory modalities seems unlikely.

Similarly, previous studies have reported that the expression of context memories becomes more generalized as memory ages. We report, first, that contextual fear memory expression changes from being sensitive to dorsal hippocampus inactivation by muscimol at 2 days post-conditioning, to insensitive at 28 days, and second, that over the same period rats lose their ability to discriminate between a novel and conditioned context. Furthermore, we show thatrepeated brief memory reactivation sessions prevent memory from becoming both hippocampus-independent and generalized. (C) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Three groups were compared: depressed children and adolescents with conduct disorder (n = 23), depressed children and adolescents without conduct disorder (n = 29) and children and adolescents without disorder (n = 37). A novel face emotion processing experiment presented faces with 'happy', 'sad', 'angry', or 'fearful' expressions of varying emotional intensity using morphed stimuli. Those with depression showed no overall or specific deficits in facial expression recognition accuracy. Instead, they showed biases affecting processing of low-intensity expressions, more often perceiving these as sad. In contrast, non-depressed controls more often misperceived low intensity negative emotions as happy. There were no differences between depressed children and adolescents with and without conduct disorder, or between children with comorbid depression/conduct disorder and controls. Face emotion processing biases rather than deficits appear to distinguish depressed from non-depressed children and adolescents.

Modulation of Activated Leukocyte Cell Adhesion Molecule-Mediated Invasion Triggers an Innate Immune Gene Response in Melanoma	JOURNAL OF INVESTIGATIVE DERMATOLOGY			English	Article							MALIGNANT-MELANOMA; OLIGONUCLEOTIDE ARRAYS; TUMOR PROGRESSION; IN-VITRO; EXPRESSION; METASTASIS; MIGRATION; GROWTH; MODEL; ALCAM	Activated leukocyte cell adhesion molecule (ALCAM/CD166) is a progression marker of a variety of cancers, including melanoma, and is a marker for mesenchymal stem cells. ALCAM expression triggers matrix metalloproteinase activity and correlates with the transition between superficial melanoma growth and deep dermal invasion in vivo. We previously showed that manipulating ALCAM functionality could both decrease and increase melanoma invasion, depending on the manner by which ALCAM function was altered. How ALCAM exerts these opposing invasive phenotypes remained elusive. In the present study, we analyzed differences in melanoma cell gene expression in two- and three-dimensional cultures as function of ALCAM-mediated adhesion. We identified a cluster of genes highly responsive to ALCAM functionality and relevant for melanoma invasion. This cluster is characterized by known invasion-related genes similar to L1 neuronal cell adhesion molecule and showed a remarkable induction of several innate immune genes. Unexpectedly, we identified major variations in the expression of genes related to an immunological response when modulating ALCAM function, including complement factors C1r and C1s. The expression and function of these proteinases were confirmed in protein assays and in vivo. Together, our results demonstrate a link between ALCAM functionality and the immune transcriptome, and support the assumption that ALCAM-ALCAM interactions could function as a cell signaling complex to promote melanoma tumor invasion.

Human temporomandibular joint and myofascial pain biochemical profiles: a case-control study	JOURNAL OF ORAL REHABILITATION			English	Article						human; temporomandibular joint; myofascial pain; musculoskeletal disorders; biomarkers; case-control study; mechanical injury; neurogenic inflammation and oxidative stress	NERVE GROWTH-FACTOR; GENE-RELATED PEPTIDE; SUBSTANCE-P; SYNOVIAL-FLUID; RHEUMATOID-ARTHRITIS; NEUROPEPTIDE-Y; NEUROKININ-A; MRI FINDINGS; ARTHROCENTESIS; BRADYKININ	Neurobiological mechanisms of human musculoskeletal pain are poorly understood. This case-control study tested the hypothesis that biomarkers within temporomandibular muscle and joint disorders (TMJD) subjects masseter muscles or temporomandibular joint (TMJ) synovial fluid correlate with plasma biomarker concentrations. Fifty subjects were recruited and categorized into TMJD cases (n = 23) and pain-free controls (n = 27) at the University of Minnesota School of Dentistry. Prior to specimen collection, pain intensity and pressure pain threshold masseter muscles and the TMJs were assessed. We collected venous blood; biopsied masseter muscle; and sampled TMJ synovial fluid on the subjects side of maximum pain intensity. We assayed these tissues for the presence of nerve growth factor (NGF), bradykinin (BK), leukotreine B4 (LTB4) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), F2-isoprostane (F2I) and substance P (SP). The data was analyzed using Spearman Correlation Coefficients. We found that only plasma concentrations of bradykinin statistically correlated with synovial fluid concentrations (? = -0.48, P = 0.005), but no association was found between pain intensities. The data suggests that biomarkers used to assess TMJD need to be acquired in a site-specific manner. We also discovered that F2I concentrations were associated with muscle pain intensity and muscle pressure pain threshold (PTT) (beta = 0.4, 95%CI: 0.030.8) and joint PPT (beta = 0.4, 95%CI: 0.070.8) suggesting that muscle oxidative stress is involved in myofascial pain and that F2-I may be a biomarker for myofascial pain.

The aims of this study were to investigate the role of: (i) the glutathione antioxidant system, and (ii) the transcription factor EB (TFEB), a newly revealed master regulator of lysosome biogenesis, in cellular adaptation to nanoparticle-induced oxidative stress. Intracellular concentrations of glutathione species and activation of TFEB were assessed in rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells following treatment with uncapped CdTe quantum dots (QDs), using biochemical, live cell fluorescence and immunocytochemical techniques. Exposure to toxic concentrations of QDs resulted in a significant enhancement of intracellular glutathione concentrations, redistribution of glutathione species and a progressive translocation and activation of TFEB. These changes were associated with an enlargement of the cellular lysosomal compartment. Together, these processes appear to have an adaptive character, and thereby participate in the adaptive cellular response to toxic nanoparticles.

Ghrelin prevents levodopa-induced inhibition of gastric emptying and increases circulating levodopa in fasted rats	NEUROGASTROENTEROLOGY AND MOTILITY			English	Article						dopamine; gastric emptying; ghrelin; levodopa; rats	PARKINSONS-DISEASE; FOS EXPRESSION; IN-VITRO; RESPONSE FLUCTUATIONS; GASTROINTESTINAL MOTILITY; SOLITARY TRACT; FOOD-INTAKE; GUINEA-PIG; C-FOS; SECRETION	Background Levodopa (l-dopa) is the most commonly used treatment for alleviating symptoms of Parkinsons disease. However, l-dopa delays gastric emptying, which dampens its absorption. We investigated whether ghrelin prevents l-dopa action on gastric emptying and enhances circulating l-dopa in rats. Methods Gastric emptying of non-nutrient methylcellulose/phenol red viscous solution was determined in fasted rats treated with orogastric or intraperitoneal (i.p.) L-dopa, or intravenous (i.v.) ghrelin 10 min before orogastric L-dopa. Plasma L-dopa and dopamine levels were determined by high pressure liquid chromatography. Plasma acyl ghrelin levels were assessed by radioimmunoassay. Fos expression in the brain was immunostained after i. v. ghrelin (30 lg kg(-1)) 10 min before i.p. L-dopa. Key Results Levodopa (5 and 15 mg kg(-1)) decreased significantly gastric emptying by 32% and 62%, respectively, when administered orally, and by 91% and 83% when injected i.p. Ghrelin (30 or 100 lg kg(-1), i. v.) completely prevented L-dopa's (15 mg kg(-1), orogastrically) inhibitory action on gastric emptying and enhanced plasma L-dopa and dopamine levels compared with vehicle 15 min after orogastric L-dopa. Levodopa (5 mg kg(-1)) did not modify plasma acyl ghrelin levels at 30 min, 1, and 2 h after i. v. injection. Levodopa (15 mg kg(-1), i.p.) induced Fos in brain autonomic centers, which was not modified by i. v. ghrelin. Conclusions& Inferences Ghrelin counteracts L-dopa-induced delayed gastric emptying but not Fos induction in the brain and enhances circulating L-dopa levels. Potential therapeutic benefits of ghrelin agonists in Parkinson's disease patients treated with L-dopa remain to be investigated.

The consumption of palatable foods can produce a rewarding effect that strengthens action-outcome associations and reinforces future behavior directed at obtaining these foods. Increasing evidence that the rewarding effects of energy-dense foods play a profound role in overeating and the development of obesity has heightened interest in studying the genes, molecules and neural circuitry that modulate food reward(1,2). The rewarding impact of different stimuli can be studied by measuring the willingness to work to obtain them, such as in operant conditioning tasks(3). Operant models of food reward measure acquired and voluntary behavioral responses that are directed at obtaining food. A commonly used measure of reward strength is an operant procedure known as the progressive ratio (PR) schedule of reinforcement.(4,5) In the PR task, the subject is required to make an increasing number of operant responses for each successive reward. The pioneering study of Hodos (1961) demonstrated that the number of responses made to obtain the last reward, termed the breakpoint, serves as an index of reward strength(4). While operant procedures that measure changes in response rate alone cannot separate changes in reward strength from alterations in performance capacity, the breakpoint derived from the PR schedule is a well-validated measure of the rewarding effects of food. The PR task has been used extensively to assess the rewarding impact of drugs of abuse and food in rats (e.g.,(6-8)), but to a lesser extent in mice(9). The increased use of genetically engineered mice and diet-induced obese mouse models has heightened demands for behavioral measures of food reward in mice. In the present article we detail the materials and procedures used to train mice to respond (lever-press) for a high-fat and high-sugar food pellets on a PR schedule of reinforcement. We show that breakpoint response thresholds increase following acute food deprivation and decrease with peripheral administration of the anorectic hormone leptin and thereby validate the use of this food-operant paradigm in mice.

Detection of Viral RNA by Fluorescence in situ Hybridization (FISH)	JOVE-JOURNAL OF VISUALIZED EXPERIMENTS			English	Article						Genetics; Issue 63; Viral genomic RNA; Fluorescence in situ Hybridization; FISH; imaging; genomics		Viruses that infect cells elicit specific changes to normal cell functions which serve to divert energy and resources for viral replication. Many aspects of host cell function are commandeered by viruses, usually by the expression of viral gene products that recruit host cell proteins and machineries. Moreover, viruses engineer specific membrane organelles or tag on to mobile vesicles and motor proteins to target regions of the cell (during de novo infection, viruses co-opt molecular motor proteins to target the nucleus; later, during virus assembly, they will hijack cellular machineries that will help in the assembly of viruses). Less is understood on how viruses, in particular those with RNA genomes, coordinate the intracellular trafficking of both protein and RNA components and how they achieve assembly of infectious particles at specific loci in the cell. The study of RNA localization began in earlier work. Developing lower eukaryotic embryos and neuronal cells provided important biological information, and also underscored the importance of RNA localization in the programming of gene expression cascades. The study in other organisms and cell systems has yielded similar important information. Viruses are obligate parasites and must utilise their host cells to replicate. Thus, it is critical to understand how RNA viruses direct their RNA genomes from the nucleus, through the nuclear pore, through the cytoplasm and on to one of its final destinations, into progeny virus particles(1). FISH serves as a useful tool to identify changes in steady-state localization of viral RNA. When combined with immunofluorescence (IF) analysis(22), FISH/IF co-analyses will provide information on the co-localization of proteins with the viral RNA(3). This analysis therefore provides a good starting point to test for RNA-protein interactions by other biochemical or biophysical tests 4,5, since co-localization by itself is not enough evidence to be certain of an interaction. In studying viral RNA localization using a method like this, abundant information has been gained on both viral and cellular RNA trafficking events(6). For instance, HIV-1 produces RNA in the nucleus of infected cells but the RNA is only translated in the cytoplasm. When one key viral protein is missing (Rev)(7), FISH of the viral RNA has revealed that the block to viral replication is due to the retention of the HIV-1 genomic RNA in the nucleus(8). Here, we present the method for visual analysis of viral genomic RNA in situ. The method makes use of a labelled RNA probe. This probe is designed to be complementary to the viral genomic RNA. During the in vitro synthesis of the antisense RNA probe, the ribonucleotide that is modified with digoxigenin (DIG) is included in an in vitro transcription reaction. Once the probe has hybridized to the target mRNA in cells, subsequent antibody labelling steps (Figure 1) will reveal the localization of the mRNA as well as proteins of interest when performing FISH/IF.

Previous studies have shown that the lamprey paratrigeminal respiratory group (pTRG) plays a crucial role in the generation of respiration. By using a combination of anatomical and physiological techniques, we characterized the bilateral connections between the pTRGs and descending projections to the motoneurons. Tracers were injected in the respiratory motoneuron pools to identify pre-motor respiratory interneurons. Retrogradely labeled cell bodies were found in the pTRG on both sides. Whole-cell recordings of the retrogradely labeled pTRG neurons showed rhythmical excitatory currents in tune with respiratory motoneuron activity. This confirmed that they were related to respiration. Intracellular labeling of individual pTRG neurons revealed axonal branches to the contralateral pTRG and bilateral projections to the respiratory motoneuronal columns. Stimulation of the pTRG induced excitatory postsynaptic potentials in ipsi- and contralateral respiratory motoneurons as well as in contralateral pTRG neurons. A lidocaine HCl (Xylocaine) injection on the midline at the rostrocaudal level of the pTRG diminished the contralateral motoneuronal EPSPs as well as a local injection of 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX) and (2R)-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (AP-5) on the recorded respiratory motoneuron.

Contaminant source identification within a building: Toward design of immune buildings	BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Source identification; Gas release; Building simulation; Immune building; ANN; Sensor	AIR-FLOW MODELS; OFFICE ENVIRONMENT; LOCATION; OPTIMIZATION; VALIDATION; NETWORKS; TRACKING; SENSOR	The level of protection of a building against the intentional or accidental release of chemical agents is crucial. Both scenarios could endanger life and safety of the buildings occupants. Equipping buildings with appropriate chemical sensors can alert the building occupants about the contaminant release. The readings of these sensors can be employed to trace the location of release, and help to take the appropriate actions to minimize the casualties. However, only a limited number of them can be installed due to their initial and operating cost. Moreover, there is no information about the source strength, release time and possible source location. This paper reports the development of a methodology to identify the source location using sensors reading from limited locations. The methodology uses the artificial neural network (ANN) as a statistical analysis integrated with a multi-zone airborne contaminant transport model, CONTAM. To evaluate the applicability of this method, the contaminant dispersion within a building was modeled and the results were integrated to an ANN for the source identification. The prediction made by the trained ANN was then evaluated by predicting the source of the contaminant in 40 extra cases, which had not been seen by the network during the training session. The model was able to predict the source location in more than 90% of the cases when the building was monitored by three or more sensors. The results show that the method can be used to help building designers decide the optimum configuration of the sensors required for a space based on the accuracy level of the source detection.

Macrophages can be polarized into M1 and M2 phenotypes, which have been linked to functional properties including production of inflammation association molecules and phagocytic activity. We compare phenotypic and functional properties of microglia derived from the adult human CNS with macrophages derived from peripheral blood monocytes in response to M1 and M2 polarizing conditions. Under M1 conditions, microglia and macrophages upregulate expression of CCR7 and CD80. M2 treatment of microglia-induced expression of CD209 but not additional markers CD23, CD163, and CD206 expressed by M2 macrophages. M1-polarizing conditions induced production of IL-12p40 by both microglia and macrophages; microglia produced higher levels of IL-10 under M1 conditions than did macrophages. Under M2 conditions, microglia +/- LPS produced comparable levels of IL-10 under M1 conditions whereas IL-10 was induced by LPS in M2 macrophages. Myelin phagocytosis was greater in microglia than macrophages under all conditions; for both cell types, activity was higher for M2 cells. Our findings delineate distinctive properties of microglia compared with exogenous myeloid cells in response to signals derived from an inflammatory environment in the CNS.

Here we show that prolonged activation of native P2X4 receptor channels by ATP induces opening of a pore permeable to NMDG+ and large fluorescent dyes in BV-2 microglial cells and primary murine microglia. This intrinsic pore formation mechanism is potentiated by LPS treatment, known to upregulate P2X4 expression in microglial cells and to mimic the microglial activation observed in neuropathic pain states. Sustained activation of the P2X7 channel subtype, also expressed in microglia, induces a pore formation that requires pannexin hemichannels and leads to plasma membrane blebbing and cytotoxicity. In contrast, P2X4 pore formation is unaffected by the pannexin blocker carbenoxolone, does not induce cytoskeletal rearrangements and does not lead to cell death. Furthermore, we show that P2X4 pore dilation is modulated by phosphoinositides (PIPn) levels as it is inhibited by wortmannin, a blocker of PIPn synthesis, suggesting possible regulation by phospholipase C-coupled pathways. Nonlethal P2X4 pore dilation could play a role in neuropathic pain by allowing the flux of large organic molecules in microglia. Different outcomes of P2X4 and P2X7 membrane permeabilization point to subtype-specific microglial responses to ATP in normal and pathological neuro-immune crosstalks.

J	Rathore, KI; Redensek, A; David, S				Rathore, Khizr I.; Redensek, Adriana; David, Samuel			Iron homeostasis in astrocytes and microglia is differentially regulated by TNF-alpha and TGF-beta 1	GLIA			English	Article						inflammation; neurodegeneration; iron; ferroportin; ceruloplasmin; ferritin; glia	SPINAL-CORD-INJURY; EPITHELIAL-MESENCHYMAL TRANSITION; MESSENGER-RNA; INFLAMMATORY RESPONSE; HUNTINGTONS-DISEASE; MULTIPLE-SCLEROSIS; OXIDATIVE STRESS; BRAIN IRON; FERRITIN; CERULOPLASMIN	Abnormal iron homeostasis is increasingly thought to contribute to the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative disorders. We have previously reported impaired iron homeostasis in a mouse model of spinal cord injury and in a mouse model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Both these disorders are associated with CNS inflammation. However, what effect inflammation, and in particular, inflammatory cytokines have on iron homeostasis in CNS glia remains largely unknown. Here we report that the proinflammatory cytokine TNF-a, and the anti-inflammatory cytokine TGF-beta 1 affect iron homeostasis in astrocytes and microglia in distinct ways. Treatment of astrocytes in vitro with TNF-a induced the expression of the iron importer divalent iron transporter 1 (DMT1) and suppressed the expression of the iron exporter ferroportin (FPN). However, TGF-beta 1 had no effect on DMT1 expression but increased the expression of FPN in astrocytes. In microglia, on the other hand, both cytokines caused induction of DMT1 and suppression of FPN expression. Iron influx and efflux assays in vitro confirmed that iron homeostasis in astrocytes and microglia is differentially regulated by these cytokines. In particular, TNF-a caused an increase in iron uptake and retention by both astrocytes and microglia, while TGF-beta 1 promoted iron efflux from astrocytes but caused iron retention in microglia. These data suggest that these two cytokines, which are expressed in CNS inflammation in injury and disease, can have profound and divergent effects on iron homeostasis in astrocytes and microglia.

Neuropsychological outcomes of standard risk and high risk patients treated for acute lymphoblastic leukemia on Dana-Farber ALL consortium protocol 95-01 at 5 years post-diagnosis	PEDIATRIC BLOOD & CANCER			English	Article						acute lymphoblastic leukemia; children; neuropsychological; risk group	CRANIAL RADIATION-THERAPY; WORKING-MEMORY; DECLARATIVE MEMORY; PROCESSING SPEED; CANCER-INSTITUTE; RANDOMIZED-TRIAL; CHILDREN; CHILDHOOD; ATTENTION; NEUROTOXICITY	Background Children treated for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) as High Risk (HR) patients may be more vulnerable to neurocognitive late effects because of the greater intensity of their therapy. We compared neuropsychological outcomes in children treated for Standard Risk (SR) or HR ALL on Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI) Consortium ALL Protocol 95-01. We also evaluated their performance relative to normative expectations. Procedure. Between 1996 and 2000, 498 children with newly diagnosed ALL were treated on Protocol 95-01, 298 of whom were eligible for neuropsychological follow-up. A feature of this protocol was modification of risk group criteria to treat more children as SR rather than HR patients, intended to minimize toxicities. Testing was completed at a median of 5.3 years post-diagnosis for 211 patients (70.8%; ages 6-25 years; 45.5% male; 40% HR), all of whom were in continuous complete remission. Results. Test scores for both groups were generally at or above normative expectation, with the exception of verbal working memory, processing complex visual information, and parent ratings of metacognitive skills. After adjusting for covariates, the SR group performed better on measures of IQ and academic achievement, working memory and visual learning. Effect sizes, however, were only in the small to moderate range. Conclusions. HR patients exhibited neuropsychological deficits relative to SR patients, though the differences were modest in degree. Modification of the risk group criteria to treat more children on the SR protocol therefore likely afforded some benefit in terms of neurocognitive late effects. Pediatr Blood Cancer 2012;58:758-765.

The results indicated that, irrespective of age, hypoxia lowered (V) over dot(O2) throughout embryogenesis without any contraction of an O-2 debt. Hypoxic hypometabolism was more prominent at E3 than at E5, probably because of the differences in O-2 sensitivity during the developmental transition from O-2 diffusion to O-2 convection forms of gas transport. Further measurements at these two ages with either progressively increasing hypoxia or a sudden drop to 8% O-2 indicated that, at E5, the less pronounced hypometabolism was accompanied by a greater drop in heart rate (HR) than at E3. It was postulated that a functional causative link existed between these two phenomena, the decrease in whole-embryo (V) over dot(O2) favouring O-2 availability to the heart. Indeed, when O-2 demands were decreased by cold exposure, the hypoxic effects on HR became similar between E3 and E5. We conclude that hypometabolism with no major reliance on anaerobic sources is the common response to hypoxia throughout embryogenesis. In the earliest phases of embryogenesis, when diffusion is the primary form of gas transport and despite the absence of neural regulation, the possibility of using some of the O-2 saved in favour of the heart adds further value to hypometabolism as a survival strategy against hypoxia.

Previous investigations strongly suggest that this behaviour is regulated by a circadian pacemaker entrained to the timing of fasting/refeeding. The neural correlate(s) of this pacemaker, the food entrainable oscillator (FEO), whether found in a neural network or a single locus, remain unknown. This study used a canonical property of circadian pacemakers, the ability to continue oscillating after removal of the entraining stimulus, to isolate activation within the neural correlates of food entrainable oscillator from all other mechanisms driving food anticipatory activity. It was hypothesized that continued anticipatory activation of central nuclei, after restricted feeding and a return to ad libitum feeding, would elucidate a neural representation of the signaling circuits responsible for the timekeeping component of the food entrainable oscillator. Animals were entrained to a temporally constrained meal then placed back on ad libitum feeding for several days until food anticipatory activity was abolished. Activation of nuclei throughout the brain was quantified using stereological analysis of c-FOS expressing cells and compared against both ad libitum fed and food entrained controls. Several hypothalamic and brainstem nuclei remained activated at the previous time of food anticipation, implicating them in the timekeeping mechanism necessary to track previous meal presentation. This study also provides a proof of concept for an experimental paradigm useful to further investigate the anatomical and molecular substrates of the FEO.

Its major function is in the post-translational processing and activation of precursor proteins. The PC1/3 knock-out (KO) mouse model has allowed us to elucidate its physiological functions in studies focused primarily on neuroendocrine tissues. However, PC1/3 is also expressed in cells of the immune system, mainly in macrophages. The present study explores the effects of innate immune challenge in the PC1/3 KO mouse. PC1/3 KO mice have an enlarged spleen with marked disorganization of the marginal zone and red pulp. Immunohistochemical studies using various markers demonstrate a depletion of dendritic cells in PC1/3 KO spleens. When challenged with lipopolysaccharide, PC1/3 KO mice are more susceptible to septic shock than wild-type controls or other PC KO mice, such as PC2 and PC7 null mice. Plasma levels of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-1 beta, and TNF-alpha) were very significantly elevated in PC1/3 KO mice, consistent with a hypercytokinemia, i.e. indicative of a major systemic uncontrolled inflammatory response or cytokine storm. Peritoneal macrophages isolated from PC1/3 KO mice also demonstrate elevated cytokine secretion when treated with LPS. Electron micrographs show morphological features indicating a prolonged activation of these cells following LPS stimulation. We also present evidence that the proinflammatory Th1 pathway is dominant in the PC1/3 KO mouse model. We conclude that aside from its important role in neuroendocrine functions PC1/3 also has an important role in the regulation of the innate immune system, most likely through the regulation of cytokine secretion in macrophages.

Transducin-like Enhancer of Split-1 (TLE1) Combines with Forkhead Box Protein G1 (FoxG1) to Promote Neuronal Survival	JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							DEACETYLASE-RELATED PROTEIN; HELIX TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR; HEAD GENE FAMILY; CEREBRAL HEMISPHERES; POSTMITOTIC NEURONS; DROSOPHILA GROUCHO; FACTOR-I; Q-DOMAIN; DIFFERENTIATION; REPRESSOR	Transducin-like enhancer of split-1 (TLE1) plays a critical role in the regulation of neurogenesis by inhibiting the differentiation of neural progenitor cells into neurons. Although TLE1 is also expressed highly in the postnatal brain and through adulthood, its role in postmitotic neurons is not clear. Using cultures of cerebellar granule neurons, we show that expression of TLE1 is reduced in neurons primed to die. Reestablishment of elevated TLE1 levels by ectopic expression protects neurons from death, whereas suppression of TLE1 expression in otherwise healthy neurons induces cell death. These results show that TLE1 is necessary for the maintenance of neuronal survival. Experiments using pharmacological inhibitors as well as expression of point mutants indicate that phosphorylation of TLE1 by casein kinase-2 (CK2) at Ser-239 and Ser-253 is necessary for its survival-promoting activity. TLE1-mediated survival is also inhibited by pharmacological inhibition of PI3K-Akt signaling but not by inhibitors of Raf-MEK-ERK signaling or other molecules, including histone deacetylases, calcium calmodulin kinase, or CK1. The survival-promoting activity of TLE1 depends critically on interaction with FoxG1, another protein involved in the regulation of neurogenesis and shown previously to promote survival of postmitotic neurons. Likewise, the ability of FoxG1 to promote neuronal survival depends on TLE1. Taken together, our study demonstrates that TLE1 cooperates with FoxG1 to promote neuronal survival in a CK2- and PI3K-Akt-dependent manner.

Even at the level of connections between single neurons, direct confirmation of this simple conjecture has proven elusive. By combining paired-cell recordings, realistic synaptic modeling, and information theory, we provide evidence that short-term plasticity can not only improve, but also reduce information transfer between neurons. We focus on a concrete example in rat neocortex, but our results may generalize to other systems. When information is contained in the timings of individual spikes, we find that facilitation, depression, and recovery affect information transmission in proportion to their impacts upon the probability of neurotransmitter release. When information is instead conveyed by mean spike rate only, the influences of short-term plasticity critically depend on the range of spike frequencies that the target network can distinguish (its effective dynamic range). Our results suggest that to efficiently transmit information, the brain must match synaptic type, coding strategy, and network connectivity during development and behavior.

The identification of subtle variations in the neurite response to changes in the spatial distribution of extracellular molecules can be achieved by monitoring the behavior of cells on protein gradients. To do this, automated high-content screening assays are needed to quantify the morphological changes resulting from growth on gradients of guidance molecules. Here, we present the use of laser-assisted protein adsorption by photobleaching (LAPAP) to allow the fabrication of large-scale substrate-bound laminin-1 gradients to study neurite extension. We produced thousands of gradients of different slopes and analyzed the variations in neurite attraction of neuron-like cells (RGC-5). An image analysis algorithm processed bright field microscopy images, detecting each cell and quantifying the soma centroid and the initiation, terminal and turning angles of the longest neurite.

The Role of EHD Proteins at the Neuronal Synapse	SCIENCE SIGNALING			English	Review							ENDOCYTOSIS; MEMBRANE; DYNAMICS; ATPASE	Eps15 homology domain (EHD) proteins are conserved adenosine triphosphatases that are involved in membrane remodeling. EHD family members are structurally similar to the guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) dynamin, and both are essential for the fission step of clathrin-mediated endocytosis. This Journal Club highlights a recent study by Jakobsson et al. that reports the unexpected finding that, rather than having a redundant function, EHD can regulate dynamin activity. Dynamin helices assemble around the neck of budding endocytic vesicles; as dynamin helices lengthen, the neck of the growing bud may become so long that GTP hydrolysis is no longer sufficient to promote fission. EHD increases the efficiency of dynamin-induced fission by restricting the length of dynamin helices. Furthermore, EHD is able to bind both dynamin and amphiphysin. Therefore, we propose a model whereby amphiphysin recruits both EHD and dynamin in neurons to regulate clathrin-dependent synaptic vesicle endocytosis.

Parallel Coding of First- and Second-Order Stimulus Attributes by Midbrain Electrosensory Neurons	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							WEAKLY ELECTRIC FISH; TEMPORAL FILTERING PROPERTIES; LATERAL LINE LOBE; RETINAL GANGLION-CELLS; IN-VIVO; APTERONOTUS-LEPTORHYNCHUS; INFORMATION-TRANSMISSION; DIRECTIONAL SELECTIVITY; TORUS-SEMICIRCULARIS; SPEECH RECOGNITION	Natural stimuli often have time-varying first-order (i.e., mean) and second-order (i.e., variance) attributes that each carry critical information for perception and can vary independently over orders of magnitude. Experiments have shown that sensory systems continuously adapt their responses based on changes in each of these attributes. This adaptation creates ambiguity in the neural code as multiple stimuli may elicit the same neural response. While parallel processing of first-and second-order attributes by separate neural pathways is sufficient to remove this ambiguity, the existence of such pathways and the neural circuits that mediate their emergence have not been uncovered to date. We recorded the responses of midbrain electrosensory neurons in the weakly electric fish Apteronotus leptorhynchus to stimuli with first-and second-order attributes that varied independently in time. We found three distinct groups of midbrain neurons: the first group responded to both first-and second-order attributes, the second group responded selectively to first-order attributes, and the last group responded selectively to second-order attributes. In contrast, all afferent hindbrain neurons responded to both first-and second-order attributes. Using computational analyses, we show how inputs from a heterogeneous population of ON-and OFF-type afferent neurons are combined to give rise to response selectivity to either first-or second-order stimulus attributes in midbrain neurons. Our study thus uncovers, for the first time, generic and widely applicable mechanisms by which parallel processing of first-and second-order stimulus attributes emerges in the brain.

Regulation of Neuronal mRNA Translation by CaM-Kinase I Phosphorylation of eIF4GII	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							LASTING SYNAPTIC PLASTICITY; LONG-TERM POTENTIATION; INITIATION-FACTOR 4G; PROTEIN-SYNTHESIS; AMPA RECEPTORS; DENDRITIC FILOPODIA; BINDING PROTEIN; ALPHA-SUBUNIT; MTOR; ACTIVATION	Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinases (CaMKs) are essential for neuronal development and plasticity, processes requiring de novo protein synthesis. Roles for CaMKs in modulating gene transcription are well established, but their involvement in mRNA translation is evolving. Here we report that activity-dependent translational initiation in cultured rat hippocampal neurons is enhanced by CaMKI-mediated phosphorylation of Ser1156 in eukaryotic initiation factor eIF4GII (4GII). Treatment with bicuculline or gabazine to enhance neuronal activity promotes recruitment of wild-type 4GII, but not the 4GII S1156A mutant or 4GI, to the heterotrimeric eIF4F (4F) complex that assembles at the 5' cap structure (m(7)GTP) of mRNA to initiate ribosomal scanning. Recruitment of 4GII to 4F is suppressed by pharmacological inhibition (STO-609) of CaM kinase kinase, the upstream activator of CaMKI. Post hoc in vitro CaMKI phosphorylation assays confirm that activity promotes phosphorylation of S1156 in transfected 4GII in neurons. Changes in cap-dependent and cap-independent translation were assessed using a bicistronic luciferase reporter transfected into neurons. Activity upregulates cap-dependent translation, and RNAi knockdown of CaMKI beta and gamma isoforms, but not alpha or delta, led to its attenuation as did blockade of NMDA receptors. Furthermore, RNAi knockdown of 4GII attenuates cap-dependent translation and reduces density of dendritic filopodia and spine formation without effect on dendritic arborization. Together, our results provide a mechanistic link between Ca2 (+) influx due to neuronal activity and regulation of cap-dependent RNA translation via CaMKI activation and selective recruitment of phosphorylated 4GII to the 4F complex, which may function to regulate activity-dependent changes in spine density.

Spatial frequency discrimination was assessed in 16 adults with normal hearing and 18 adults with profound deafness who had a cochlear implant. Thresholds were measured with sinusoidal gratings using a two-alternative temporal forced-choice procedure combined with an adaptive staircase. Cochlear implant users had significantly poorer spatial frequency discrimination compared with normal hearing participants. Therefore, auditory privation leads to substantial changes in this particular visual function and these changes remain even after the restoration of hearing with a cochlear implant.

Activity-Based Probes Linked with Laser-Cleavable Mass Tags for Signal Amplification in Imaging Mass Spectrometry: Analysis of Serine Hydrolase Enzymes in Mammalian Tissue	ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							MALDI; SECTIONS; PROTEINS; LOCALIZATION; CHEMISTRY; MS	A novel functional imaging mass spectrometry technology is described that utilizes activity-based probes for imaging enzyme active sites in tissue sections. We demonstrate this technology using an activity-based probe (fluorophosphate) that is specific for serine hydrolases. A dendrimer containing multiple mass tags that is attached to the activity-based probe is used to analyze the binding sites of the probe through release and measurement of the mass tags on laser irradiation. A generation 8 poly(amido amine) dendrimer with 1024 amino groups was labeled with an azide group, and then, more than 900 mass tags were attached in order to achieve signal amplification of nearly 3 orders of magnitude. The experimental protocol first involves binding of the activity-based probe containing an alkyne group to serine hydrolases in the tissue section followed by attachment of the dendrimer labeled with mass tags to the bound probe by Click chemistry. On irradiation of the labeled tissue by the laser beam in a raster pattern, the mass tags are liberated and recorded by the mass analyzer; consequently, the ion image of the mass tag reveals the distribution of serine hydrolases in the tissue. This process was shown using rat brain and mouse embryo sections. Targeted imaging has the advantage of providing high spatial resolution and high sensitivity through the use of signal amplification chemistry with high target specificity through the use of an enzyme activity probe.

Hierarchical processing of complex motion along the primate dorsal visual pathway	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						receptive field; optic flow	CORTICAL AREA MST; POSTERIOR INFEROTEMPORAL CORTEX; SUPERIOR TEMPORAL AREA; CATS STRIATE CORTEX; OPTIC FLOW STIMULI; RECEPTIVE-FIELDS; MACAQUE MONKEY; RESPONSE SELECTIVITY; SPATIAL-DISTRIBUTION; SYNAPTIC DEPRESSION	Neurons in the medial superior temporal (MST) area of the primate visual cortex respond selectively to complex motion patterns defined by expansion, rotation, and deformation. Consequently they are often hypothesized to be involved in important behavioral functions, such as encoding the velocities of moving objects and surfaces relative to the observer. However, the computations underlying such selectivity are unknown. In this work we have developed a unique, naturalistic motion stimulus and used it to probe the complex selectivity of MST neurons. The resulting data were then used to estimate the properties of the feed-forward inputs to each neuron. This analysis yielded models that successfully accounted for much of the observed stimulus selectivity, provided that the inputs were combined via a nonlinear integration mechanism that approximates a multiplicative interaction among MST inputs. In simulations we found that this type of integration has the functional role of improving estimates of the 3D velocity of moving objects. As this computation is of general utility for detecting complex stimulus features, we suggest that it may represent a fundamental aspect of hierarchical sensory processing.

However recent evidence suggests that a limited degree of plasticity remains after this period and well into adulthood. Here, we ask the question, "what limits the degree of plasticity in adulthood?'' Although this limit has been assumed to be due to neural factors, we show that the optical quality of the retinal image ultimately limits the brain potential for change. We correct the high-order aberrations (HOAs) normally present in the eye's optics using adaptive optics, and reveal a greater degree of neuronal plasticity than previously appreciated.

Detection of epileptic activity in fMRI without recording the EEG	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						fMRI; Epilepsy; Activelets; Sparse representation; Clustering; Hemodynamic response function	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; HEMODYNAMIC-RESPONSE FUNCTION; FUNCTIONAL MRI; CLUSTERING ANALYSIS; WAVE DISCHARGES; FOCAL EPILEPSY; BALLOON MODEL; SPIKES; DECONVOLUTION; SPARSE	EEG-fMRI localizes epileptic foci by detecting cerebral hemodynamic changes that are correlated to epileptic events visible in EEG. However, scalp EEG is insensitive to activity restricted to deep structures and recording the EEG in the scanner is complex and results in major artifacts that are difficult to remove. This study presents a new framework for identifying the BOLD manifestations of epileptic discharges without having to record the EEG. The first stage is based on the detection of epileptic events for each voxel by sparse representation in the wavelet domain. The second stage is to gather voxels according to proximity in time and space of detected activities. This technique was evaluated on data generated by superposing artificial responses at different locations and responses amplitude in the brain for 6 control subject runs. The method was able to detect effectively and consistently for responses amplitude of at least 1% above baseline. 46 runs from 15 patients with focal epilepsy were investigated. The results demonstrate that the method detected at least one concordant event in 37/41 runs. The maps of activation obtained from our method were more similar to those obtained by EEG-fMRI than to those obtained by the other method used in this context, 2D-Temporal Cluster Analysis. For 5 runs without event read on scalp EEG, 3 runs showed an activation concordant with the patient's diagnostic. It may therefore be possible, at least when spikes are infrequent, to detect their BOLD manifestations without having to record the EEG. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Different subtypes of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) receptors are suggested to be associated with different types of pain responses. Here we show that serotonin also inhibits catechol O-methyltransferase (COMT), an enzyme that contributes to modultion the perception of pain, via non-competitive binding to the site bound by catechol substrates with a binding affinity comparable to the binding affinity of catechol itself (K-i = 44 mu M). Using computational modeling, biochemical tests and cellular assays we show that serotonin actively competes with the methyl donor S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) within the catalytic site. Binding of serotonin to the catalytic site inhibits the access of SAM, thus preventing methylation of COMT substrates. The results of in vivo animal studies show that serotonin-induced pain hypersensitivity in mice is reduced by either SAM pretreatment or by the combined administration of selective antagonists for beta(2)- and beta(3)-adrenergic receptors, which have been previously shown to mediate COMT-dependent pain signaling. Our results suggest that inhibition of COMT via serotonin binding contributes to pain hypersensitivity, providing additional strategies for the treatment of clinical pain conditions.

Exploiting Drosophila genetics, we have uncovered a critical role for the target of rapamycin (TOR) in the regulation of synaptic homeostasis at the Drosophila larval neuromuscular junction. Loss of postsynaptic TOR disrupts a retrograde compensatory enhancement in neurotransmitter release that is normally triggered by a reduction in postsynaptic glutamate receptor activity. Moreover, postsynaptic overexpression of TOR or a phosphomimetic form of S6 ribosomal protein kinase, a common target of TOR, can trigger a strong retrograde increase in neurotransmitter release. Interestingly, heterozygosity for elF4E, a critical component of the cap-binding protein complex, blocks the retrograde signal in all these cases. Our findings suggest that cap-dependent translation under the control of TOR plays a critical role in establishing the activity dependent homeostatic response at the NMJ.

However, evidence for a double association-the influence of linguistic background on music pitch processing and disorders-remains elusive. Because languages differ in their usage of elements (e.g., pitch) that are also essential for music, a unique opportunity for examining such language-to-music associations comes from a cross-cultural (linguistic) comparison of congenital amusia, a neurogenetic disorder affecting the music (pitch and rhythm) processing of about 5% of the Western population. In the present study, two populations (Hong Kong and Canada) were compared. One spoke a tone language in which differences in voice pitch correspond to differences in word meaning (in Hong Kong Cantonese, /si/ means 'teacher' and 'to try' when spoken in a high and mid pitch pattern, respectively). Using the On-line Identification Test of Congenital Amusia, we found Cantonese speakers as a group tend to show enhanced pitch perception ability compared to speakers of Canadian French and English (non-tone languages). This enhanced ability occurs in the absence of differences in rhythmic perception and persists even after relevant factors such as musical background and age were controlled. Following a common definition of amusia (5% of the population), we found Hong Kong pitch amusics also show enhanced pitch abilities relative to their Canadian counterparts. These findings not only provide critical evidence for a double association of music and speech, but also argue for the reconceptualization of communicative disorders within a cultural framework. Along with recent studies documenting cultural differences in visual perception, our auditory evidence challenges the common assumption of universality of basic mental processes and speaks to the domain generality of culture-to-perception influences.

LMC axons also express ephrinAs, while their EphA receptors are expressed in the limb mesenchyme. In vitro studies have suggested that reverse signaling from limb-derived EphA4 to axonal ephrinAs might result in attraction of LMC axons. However, genetic evidence for this function is lacking. Here we use the Dunn chamber turning assay to show that EphA proteins are chemoattractants and elicit fast turning responses in LMC neurons in vitro. Moreover, ectopic expression of EphA4 in chick hindlimb changes the limb trajectory of LMC axons. Nervous system-specific deletion of EphA4 in mice resulted in fewer LMC axon projection errors than the ubiquitous deletion of EphA4. Additionally, a signaling-incompetent EphA4 mutant partially rescued guidance errors in the hindlimb, suggesting that limb-derived EphA4 contributes to the establishment of LMC projections. In summary, we provide evidence for a role of EphA:ephrinA attractive reverse signaling in motor axon guidance and in vivo evidence of in-parallel forward Eph and reverse ephrin signaling function in the same neuronal population.

Here, we tested the hypothesis that impaired consciousness during NREM sleep is associated with an increased modularity of brain activity. Cerebral connectivity was quantified in resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging times series acquired in 13 healthy volunteers during wakefulness and NREM sleep. The analysis revealed a modification of the hierarchical organization of large-scale networks into smaller independent modules during NREM sleep, independently from EEG markers of the slow oscillation. Such modifications in brain connectivity, possibly driven by sleep ultraslow oscillations, could hinder the brain's ability to integrate information and account for decreased consciousness during NREM sleep.

Indeed, in proliferating cells CUX1 was shown to regulate several genes involved in DNA replication, progression into S phase and later, the spindle assembly checkpoint that controls progression through mitosis. siRNA-mediated knockdown established that CUX1 is required for cell motility. Moreover, higher expression of short CUX1 isoforms, as observed in many cancers, was shown to stimulate cell migration and invasion. In parallel, elevated expression particularly in higher grade tumors of breast and pancreatic cancers implicated CUX1 in tumor initiation and progression. Indeed, transgenic mouse models demonstrated a causal role of CUX1 in cancers originating from various cell types. These studies revealed that higher CUX1 expression or activity not only stimulates cell proliferation and motility, but also promotes genetic instability. CUX1 has also been implicated in the etiology of polycystic kidney diseases, both from a transgenic approach and the analysis of CUX1 activity in multiple mouse models of this disease. Studies in neurobiology have uncovered a potential implication of CUX1 in cognitive disorders, neurodegeneration and obesity. CUX1 was shown to be expressed specifically in pyramidal neurons of the neocortex upper layers where it regulates dendrite branching, spine development, and synapse formation. In addition, modulation of CUX1 expression in neurons of the hypothalamus has been associated with changes in leptin receptor trafficking in the vicinity of the primary cilium resulting in altered leptin signaling and ultimately, eating behavior. Overall, studies in various fields have allowed the development of several cell-based assays to monitor CUX1 function and have extended the range of organs in which CUX1 plays an important role in development and tissue homeostasis.

J	Tong, XK; Lecrux, C; Hamel, E				Tong, Xin-Kang; Lecrux, Clotilde; Hamel, Edith			Age-Dependent Rescue by Simvastatin of Alzheimer's Disease Cerebrovascular and Memory Deficits	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							AMYLOID PRECURSOR PROTEIN; CEREBRAL-BLOOD-FLOW; TRAUMATIC BRAIN-INJURY; NITRIC-OXIDE SYNTHASE; OXIDATIVE STRESS; TRANSGENIC MICE; MOUSE MODEL; SYNAPTIC PLASTICITY; SPATIAL MEMORY; IN-VIVO	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is now established as a progressive compromise not only of the neurons but also of the cerebral vasculature. Increasing evidence also indicates that cerebrovascular dysfunction may be a key or an aggravating pathogenic factor in AD, emphasizing the importance to properly control this deficit when aiming for effective therapy. Here, we report that simvastatin (3-6 months, 40 mg/kg/d) completely rescued cerebrovascular reactivity, basal endothelial nitric oxide synthesis, and activity-induced neurometabolic and neurovascular coupling in adult (6 months) and aged (12 months) transgenic mice overexpressing the Swedish and Indiana mutations of the human amyloid precursor protein (AD mice). Remarkably, simvastatin fully restored short-and long-term memory in adult, but not in aged AD mice. These beneficial effects occurred without any decreasing effect of simvastatin on brain amyloid-beta (A beta) levels or plaque load. However, in AD mice with recovered memory, protein levels of the learning-and memory-related immediate early genes c-Fos and Egr-1 were normalized or upregulated in hippocampal CA1 neurons, indicative of restored neuronal function. In contrast, the levels of phospholipase A2, enkephalin, PSD-95, synaptophysin, or glutamate NMDA receptor subunit type 2B were either unaltered in AD mice or unaffected by treatment. These findings disclose new sites of action for statins against A beta-induced neuronal and cerebrovascular deficits that could be predictive of therapeutic benefit in AD patients. They further indicate that simvastatin and, possibly, other brain penetrant statins bear high therapeutic promise in early AD and in patients with vascular diseases who are at risk of developing AD.

Here, we assessed an alternative possibility; whether tolerance of delta opioid receptor agonists (DORs) could be related to agonist-specific recycling. A first series of experiments revealed that DOR internalization by DPDPE and SNC-80 was similar, but only DPDPE induced recycling. We then established that the non-recycling agonist SNC-80 generated acute analgesic tolerance that was absent in mice treated with DPDPE. Furthermore, both agonists stabilized different conformations, whose distinct interaction with G beta gamma subunits led to different modalities of beta-arrestin2 (beta arr2) recruitment. In particular, bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) assays revealed that sustained activation by SNC-80 drew the receptor C terminus in close proximity of the N-terminal domain of G gamma 2, causing beta arr2 to interact with receptors and G beta gamma subunits. DPDPE moved the receptor C-tail away from the G beta gamma dimer, resulting in beta arr2 recruitment to the receptor but not in the vicinity of G gamma 2. These differences were associated with stable DOR-beta arr2 association, poor recycling, and marked desensitization following exposure to SNC-80, while DPDPE promoted transient receptor interaction with beta arr2 and effective recycling, which conferred protection from desensitization. Together, these data indicate that DORs may adopt ligand-specific conformations whose distinct recycling properties determine the extent of desensitization and are predictive of analgesic tolerance. Based on these findings, we propose that the development of functionally selective DOR ligands that favor recycling could constitute a valid strategy for the production of longer acting opioid analgesics.

We assessed whether astrocytes can provide iron to cells in the CNS for remyelination. To study this we generated a conditional deletion of the iron efflux transporter ferroportin (Fpn) in astrocytes, and induced focal demyelination in the mouse spinal cord dorsal column by microinjection of lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC). Remyelination assessed by electron microscopy was reduced in astrocyte-specific Fpn knock-out mice compared with wild-type controls, as was proliferation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs). Cell culture work showed that lack of iron reduces the ability of microglia to express cytokines (TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta) involved in remyelination. Furthermore, astrocytes in culture express high levels of FGF-2 in response to IL-1 beta, and IGF-1 in response to TNF-alpha stimulation. FGF-2 and IGF-1 are known to be important for myelination. Reduction in IL-1 beta and IGF-1 were also seen in astrocyte-specific Fpn knock-out mice after LPC-induced demyelination. These data suggest that iron efflux from astrocytes plays a role in remyelination by either direct effects on OPCs or indirectly by affecting glial activation.

Purpose: To examine the accuracy of rapid influenza diagnostic tests (RIDTs) in adults and children with influenza-like illness and evaluate factors associated with higher accuracy. Data Sources: PubMed and EMBASE through December 2011; BIOSIS and Web of Science through March 2010; and citations of articles, guidelines, reviews, and manufacturers. Study Selection: Studies that compared RIDTs with a reference standard of either reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (first choice) or viral culture. Data Extraction: Reviewers abstracted study data by using a standardized form and assessed quality by using Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies criteria. Data Synthesis: 159 studies evaluated 26 RIDTs, and 35% were conducted during the H1N1 pandemic. Failure to report whether results were assessed in a blinded manner and the basis for patient recruitment were important quality concerns. The pooled sensitivity and specificity were 62.3% (95% CI, 57.9% to 66.6%) and 98.2% (CI, 97.5% to 98.7%), respectively. The positive and negative likelihood ratios were 34.5 (CI, 23.8 to 45.2) and 0.38 (CI, 0.34 to 0.43), respectively. Sensitivity estimates were highly heterogeneous, which was partially explained by lower sensitivity in adults (53.9% [CI, 47.9% to 59.8%]) than in children (66.6% [CI, 61.6% to 71.7%]) and a higher sensitivity for influenza A (64.6% [CI, 59.0% to 70.1%) than for influenza B (52.2% [CI, 45.0% to 59.3%). Limitation: Incomplete reporting limited the ability to assess the effect of important factors, such as specimen type and duration of influenza symptoms, on diagnostic accuracy. Conclusion: Influenza can be ruled in but not ruled out through the use of RIDTs. Sensitivity varies across populations, but it is higher in children than in adults and for influenza A than for influenza B.

Claudio			Minocycline corrects early, pre-plaque neuroinflammation and inhibits BACE-1 in a transgenic model of Alzheimer's disease-like amyloid pathology	JOURNAL OF NEUROINFLAMMATION			English	Article						Alzheimer; A beta?beta?-oligomers; BACE; iNOS; Microglia; Minocycline; NFkB	NF-KAPPA-B; MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; NONSTEROIDAL ANTIINFLAMMATORY DRUGS; RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIAL; BETA-SECRETASE ACTIVITY; PRECURSOR PROTEIN; A-BETA; MOUSE MODEL; MICROGLIAL ACTIVATION; CEREBRAL-ISCHEMIA	Background: A growing body of evidence indicates that inflammation is one of the earliest neuropathological events in Alzheimer's disease. Accordingly, we have recently shown the occurrence of an early, pro-inflammatory reaction in the hippocampus of young, three-month-old transgenic McGill-Thy1-APP mice in the absence of amyloid plaques but associated with intracellular accumulation of amyloid beta petide oligomers. The role of such a pro-inflammatory process in the progression of the pathology remained to be elucidated. Methods and results: To clarify this we administered minocycline, a tetracyclic derivative with anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties, to young, pre-plaque McGill-Thy1-APP mice for one month. The treatment ended at the age of three months, when the mice were still devoid of plaques. Minocycline treatment corrected the up-regulation of inducible nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase-2 observed in young transgenic placebo mice. Furthermore, the down-regulation of inflammatory markers correlated with a reduction in amyloid precursor protein levels and amyloid precursor protein-related products. Beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 activity and levels were found to be up-regulated in transgenic placebo mice, while minocycline treatment restored these levels to normality. The anti-inflammatory and beta-secretase 1 effects could be partly explained by the inhibition of the nuclear factor kappa B pathway. Conclusions: Our study suggests that the pharmacological modulation of neuroinflammation might represent a promising approach for preventing or delaying the development of Alzheimer's disease neuropathology at its initial, pre-clinical stages. The results open new vistas to the interplay between inflammation and amyloid pathology.	[Ferretti, Maria Teresa; Allard, Simon; Partridge, Vanessa; Ducatenzeiler, Adriana; Cuello, A.

Magnetic resonance imaging of resting OEF and CMRO2 using a generalized calibration model for hypercapnia and hyperoxia	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Calibrated MRI; BOLD; OEF; CMRO2; Hypercapnia; Hyperoxia; Carbogen; Oxygen; Metabolism	CEREBRAL-BLOOD-FLOW; POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; OXYGEN EXTRACTION FRACTION; LABELING FUNCTIONAL MRI; INVIVO NMR-SPECTROSCOPY; OXIDATIVE-METABOLISM; BOLD FMRI; QUANTITATIVE BOLD; CARBON-DIOXIDE; BRAIN	We present a method allowing determination of resting cerebral oxygen metabolism (CMRO2) from MRI and end-tidal O-2 measurements acquired during a pair of respiratory manipulations producing different combinations of hypercapnia and hyperoxia. The approach is based on a recently introduced generalization of calibrated MRI signal models that is valid for arbitrary combinations of blood flow and oxygenation change. Application of this model to MRI and respiratory data during a predominantly hyperoxic gas manipulation yields a specific functional relationship between the resting BOLD signal M and the resting oxygen extraction fraction OEF0. Repeating the procedure using a second, primarily hypercapnic, manipulation provides a different functional form of M vs. OEF0. These two equations can be readily solved for the two unknowns M and OEF0. The procedure also yields the resting arterial O-2 content, which when multiplied by resting cerebral blood flow provides the total oxygen delivery in absolute physical units. The resultant map of oxygen delivery can be multiplied by the map of OEF0 to obtain a map of the resting cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen consumption (CMRO2) in absolute physical units. Application of this procedure in a group of seven human subjects provided average values of 0.35 +/- 0.04 and 6.0 +/- 0.7% for OEF0 and M, respectively in gray-matter (M valid for 30 ms echo-time at 3 T). Multiplying OEF0 estimates by the individual values of resting gray-matter CBF (mean 52 +/- 5 ml/100 g/min) and the measured arterial O-2 content gave a group average resting CMRO2 value of 145 +/- 30 mu mol/100 g/min. The method also allowed the generation of maps depicting resting OEF, BOLD signal, and CMRO2. (c) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Abnormal cortical processing of pattern motion in amblyopia: Evidence from fMRI	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Amblyopia; Motion; MT; V5; Plaid; Dorsal Stream	VISUAL AREA MT; PERCEPTION FOLLOWING LESIONS; SUPERIOR TEMPORAL SULCUS; PURSUIT EYE-MOVEMENTS; GLOBAL MOTION; STRABISMIC AMBLYOPIA; OPTIC FLOW; BINOCULAR INTERACTION; EXTRASTRIATE CORTEX; RECEPTIVE-FIELDS	Converging evidence from human psychophysics and animal neurophysiology indicates that amblyopia is associated with abnormal function of area MT, a motion sensitive region of the extrastriate visual cortex. In this context, the recent finding that amblyopic eyes mediate normal perception of dynamic plaid stimuli was surprising, as neural processing and perception of plaids has been closely linked to MT function. One intriguing potential explanation for this discrepancy is that the amblyopic eye recruits alternative visual brain areas to support plaid perception. This is the hypothesis that we tested. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure the response of the amblyopic visual cortex and thalamus to incoherent and coherent motion of plaid stimuli that were perceived normally by the amblyopic eye. We found a different pattern of responses within the visual cortex when plaids were viewed by amblyopic as opposed to non-amblyopic eyes. The non-amblyopic eyes of amblyopes and control eyes differentially activated the hMT + complex when viewing incoherent vs. coherent plaid motion, consistent with the notion that this region is centrally involved in plaid perception. However, for amblyopic eye viewing, hMT + activation did not vary reliably with motion type. In a sub-set of our participants with amblyopia we were able to localize MT and MST within the larger hMT + complex and found a lack of plaid motion selectivity in both sub-regions. The response of the pulvinar and ventral V3 to plaid stimuli also differed under amblyopic vs. non-amblyopic eye viewing conditions, however the response of these areas did vary according to motion type. These results indicate that while the perception of the plaid stimuli was constant for both amblyopic and non-amblyopic viewing, the network of neural areas that supported this perception was different.

Genetics and diagnosis of central diabetes insipidus	ANNALES D ENDOCRINOLOGIE			English	Article							IMPROVES ORTHOSTATIC TOLERANCE; LAMINA TERMINALIS NEURONS; NORMAL THIRST RESPONSES; WATER DRINKING; AUTOSOMAL-DOMINANT; ANTIDIURETIC-HORMONE; PLASMA VASOPRESSIN; ACTIVE VASOPRESSIN; CRYSTAL-STRUCTURE; BRATTLEBORO RATS	Most of the central diabetes insipidus cases seen in general practice are acquired but the rare cases of hereditary autosomal dominant or recessive neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus have provided further cellular understanding of the mechanisms responsible for pre-hormone folding, maturation and release. Autosomal dominant central diabetes insipidus is secondary to the toxic accumulation of vasopressin mutants as fibrillar aggregates in the endoplasmic reticulum of hypothalamic magnocellular neurons producing vasopressin. As well, Trpv1(-/-) and Trpv4(-/-) mice have shed new light on the perception of tonicity through the stretch receptors TRPVs expressed both in central and peripheral neurons. The genomic information provided by sequencing the AVP gene is key to the routine care of these patients and, as in other genetic diseases, reduces health costs and provides psychological benefits to patients and families. In addition, simple, inexpensive blood and urine measurements together with clinical characteristics and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) could distinguish between central, nephrogenic and polydipsic cases.

Voluntary contraction of the index finger was associated with bilateral electromyographic activity in the first dorsal interosseus muscle. Motor-evoked potentials of identical latencies were produced bilaterally after unilateral M1 stimulation. Measures of intracortical inhibition and facilitation were within normal limits bilaterally although a shorter contralateral silent period was found for both hemispheres. Taken together, the current data suggest a pattern of M1 excitability very similar to that found in patients with congenital mirror movements and no other motor abnormality. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

We now review the different motor behaviors induced by chemosensory stimuli in fish as well as their neural substrate. A great deal of research has focused on migratory, reproductive, foraging, and escape behaviors but it is only recently that the molecules mediating these chemotactic responses have become well-characterized. Chemotactic responses are mediated by three sensory systems: olfactory, gustatory, and diffuse chemosensory. The olfactory sensory neuron responses to chemicals are now better understood. In addition, the olfactory projections to the central nervous system were recently shown to display an odotopic organization in the forebrain. Moreover, a specific downward projection underlying motor responses to olfactory inputs was recently described.

We hypothesized that suicide could be associated with cognitive inhibition deficit. Our study aimed to systematically review all published articles that examined the relation between cognitive inhibition deficit and suicidal behaviours (that is, suicide attempt or suicidal ideation) in patients with affective disorders. Method: We performed an English and French MEDLINE and EMBASE search, ranging from 1970 to 2010, indexed under the MeSH terms of suicide, neuropsychology, neuropsychological tests, and executive function, combined with the following title and abstract terms: neuropsychological functions, executive functioning, and executive performance. Results: Among the 164 selected studies, 9 observational studies met the selection criteria and were included in the final analysis. The number of participants ranged from 57 to 244 (28% to 66%, respectively, were men). Executive dysfunction was more frequently found among patients with suicidal behaviours. In particular, higher cognitive inhibition deficit was observed in depressed subjects with suicide behaviours, compared with depressed subjects without any suicidal behaviour. The results of the meta-analysis showed a higher impairment in inhibition score, according to the number of perseverations in the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (Cohen d = 0.68) than in inhibition according to the time needed to perform the Trail-Making Test part B (d = 0.01) among patients with suicidal behaviour, compared with patients with no suicidal behaviour.. Conclusion: This systematic review and meta-analysis showed a positive association between cognitive inhibition deficit and suicide attempts in patients with affective disorders. Future research should examine whether cognitive inhibition deficit precedes the suicidal behaviour.

Twelve healthy volunteers were asked to do a reaching task while grasping a wooden block and match the block's position with a corresponding target displayed on a flat screen, without vision. Following that, subjects performed resistive exercises with Thera-band strips until fatigue was induced and then the position sense task was repeated. A significant change in the endpoint position was observed after fatigue, in the up/down direction (p <= .001). The variability of endpoint positions in up/down direction was also significantly increased after fatigue (p <= .03). There was no significant change in endpoint orientation but there was a significant fatigue x orientation effect on endpoint rotational variability. In a follow-up experiment, a group of subjects repeated the same protocol, but with a period of quiet rest between the two position sense tasks. In that group, there were no differences in endpoint position, orientation or variability. Muscle fatigue is an important factor that should be taken into consideration during the treatment of musculoskeletal injuries as well as athletic training.

The rationale underlying the choice of treatment modality is usually unclear, as there is little good quality evidence available. Methods. - We discuss the patient and aneurysm-related factors cited in the neurovascular literature that are considered to influence aneurysm treatment choices. Results. - The relevance and direction of influence of rupture status, age, type of presentation, and general medical condition, as well as aneurysm size, location, morphology, and multiplicity are discussed. The validity of these factors in influencing treatment decisions remains unclear, with frequently opposing views on the same factor by clinicians practicing opposing techniques. Perceived differences in efficacy and safety of the two different treatment approaches are commonly used in an attempt to justify treatment choices. Difficulties with treatment selection and case-by-case reasoning are reviewed. Conclusion. - Properly designed and conducted randomized trials are necessary in order to settle the controversy and to determine the optimal treatment modality for intracranial aneurysms. In the absence of reliable knowledge on which to base treatment decisions, the ethically appropriate choice for any clinician, from surgical or endovascular backgrounds, is to participate in randomized trials.

We review the role played by randomized trials in the determination of the best management of intracranial aneurysms in the early era of surgical clipping. Methods. - Landmark trials and cooperative studies are analyzed and results summarized in a narrative review. Results. - The most convincing evidence in favour of surgical management of ruptured intracranial aneurysms came from early randomized trials conducted from the 1950s to 1970s. Large historical observational studies, performed between the 1970s and 2000, aiming to guide clinical practice, provided only statistical associations mixed with confounding variables. After the early RCTs, the next important gain in reliable knowledge occurred with completion of the ISAT trial, more than 25 years later. Conclusion. - The pioneering neurosurgeons of early trials can provide the inspiration necessary to make real progress in understanding the best clinical management of intracranial aneurysms.

Ruptured aneurysms and the International Subarachnoid Aneurysm Trial (ISAT): What is known and what remains to be questioned	NEUROCHIRURGIE			English	Article						Intracranial aneurysm	SELECTIVE ENDOVASCULAR TREATMENT; INTRACRANIAL ANEURYSMS; NEUROSURGICAL PRACTICE; VASCULAR NEUROSURGERY; POSITION STATEMENT; COIL EMBOLIZATION; HEMORRHAGE; SUBGROUP; IMPACT; MANAGEMENT	Background and purpose. - The International Subarachnoid Aneurysm Trial (ISAT) was a major study comparing clipping and coiling of ruptured intracranial aneurysms. The trial provided answers that were the subject of milltiple letters and editorial comments. Methods. - We review the most common critiques that were published in major neurosurgical journals, trying to identify what aspects of ISAT could have been improved, and what questions remain to be studied. Results. - Frequent critiques include imprecise selection criteria, lack of requirement for the technical proficiency of surgical participants, lack of angiographic controls of surgically treated patients, and poorly chosen primary endpoints. Other issues that are often raised are the poor recruitment rate which endangered generalization of results, the excessive delays in performing clipping which led to rebleeding episodes, lack of blinding in the assessment of outcomes, and subjective questionnaires. Nonetheless, the design of the study as a pragmatic trial was appropriate, as was the choice of the primary endpoint. The overall trial results could not be verified for all subgroups of interest, and currently many patients who would not have been included in ISAT are treated by coiling, while other patients are treated by clipping despite ISAT results. Hence a new trial, complementary to the original ISAT, may now be indicated. Conclusion. - ISAT was well-designed and conducted, but many questions remain. They should be addressed by a new trial.

Clipping vs. coiling in acute aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage: Should the patient's medical condition influence treatment modality?

Medical complications resulting from the bleeding itself, along with the patient's underlying medical conditions are known to represent possible prognostic factors in acute SAH. However, their respective significance on the patients overall clinical outcome following either endovascular coiling (EC) or surgical clipping (SC) remains to be ascertained as well as their potential role in choosing a definitive treatment option. We thus reviewed the evidence concerning the patient's medical condition as a factor in this decision making process. Methodology. - Source data were obtained from a MEDLINE search of the medical literature and by manual review of published randomised trials comparing EC to SC. Results. - The last three decades allowed for detection of medical complications with increasing frequency in the context of SAH, as awareness for them has improved. Despite the fact that a patient's extra-neurological condition can be a significant prognostic factor after a SAH, our review demonstrates that medical conditions in general were not taken into consideration in randomized trials comparing EC to SC. Also, we found no analysis comparing the potential role of prior versus post-SAH medical conditions in choosing either therapeutic avenue. Conclusion. - It is not determined whether it is appropriate for SAH patients to be offered treatment for a ruptured aneurysm based mostly on anatomical criteria or if, within certain subgroups of patients, EC and SC should also be recommended in light of what the patient can tolerate from a medical standpoint. Although we hypothesize that in practice, the patient's medical condition is considered in the decision making process, it remains to be documented. Patient, aneurysm and institution-related factors are all interrelated, as is patient care. Data on all of these factors are thus needed and their analysis by association ather than by dissociation may be the key in answering our question. (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.

Although most patients present rapidly after the bleed, some may seek medical attention in a delayed fashion due to non-resolving or worsening headaches or new neurological deficits, requiring treatment during the period at risk for VS. Such patients may either present asymptomatic radiological VS on their diagnostic angiogram or present symptomatic VS confirmed on angiogram. A similar situation may occur in patients presenting within the first 48 hours after SAH with very early angiographic VS. Deciding on the optimal timing and modality of treatment in such patients with SAH and symptomatic VS on presentation is controversial. Only six observational studies that specifically assessed aneurysm treatment in the presence of symptomatic VS have been published to date.

There is still controversy, however, regarding the specific role of this region in processing various types of concepts. There have been reports of patients suffering from semantic dementia (SD), a neurodegenerative condition in which the ATL is damaged bilaterally, who present with greater semantic impairment for concrete concepts than for abstract concepts, an effect known as reversal of the concreteness effect. This effect has previously been interpreted as reflecting degraded visual-perceptual features of objects due to damage to the inferior temporal lobes such as is observed in SD. Temporal lobe atrophy in SD, however, is bilateral even if it usually predominates to the left ATL, and it has been found to extend beyond the ATL, throughout the temporal lobes including medial and posterior temporal lobe regions. The question therefore remains whether greater impairment for concrete concepts results from damage to the ATL or from damage to the visual association cortex, and if unilateral damage can produce such a deficit. The aim of the present study was to investigate the processing of concrete and abstract words in rare patients who underwent a selective ATL surgical resection, and to compare their performance with that of patients with selective medial temporal lobe damage sparing the An region. Seven patients with a selective unilateral anterior temporal resection (ATL), 15 patients with a selective unilateral amygdalo-hippocampectomy (SeAH), and 15 healthy age- and education-matched controls underwent detailed neuropsychological assessment and carried out a semantic similarity judgment task evaluating their comprehension of concrete and abstract words. Results showed that both ATL and SeAH groups were significantly impaired on the semantic task relative to the control group. Within the patient groups, however, comprehension of concrete words was significantly more impaired than that of abstract words in the An group, while comprehension of abstract and concrete words was equally affected in the SeAH group. Results of this study suggest that the ATL region may play a critical role in processing concrete concepts, and that the reversal of the concreteness effect observed in ATL patients may result from damage to a categorical organization underlying the representation of concrete concepts.

Key phase H and Hi trial data for eribulin mesylate, ixabepilone, and nab-paclitaxel, published since 2006, are discussed on the basis of recency, depth, and quality. Eribulin mesylate is the first monotherapy to significantly increase overall survival in patients with pretreated MBC, but nab-paclitaxel offers a novel and safer mode of delivery in comparison with standard taxanes. By contrast, the use of ixabepilone will be limited for now, until the associated neurotoxicity can be better managed. Alongside a brief overview of the other major chemotherapies currently in use, we have aimed to provide a Canadian context for how these novel agents may be integrated into clinical practice.

Differential expression and processing of secretogranin II in relation to the status of pheochromocytoma: implications for the production of the tumoral marker EM66	JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR ENDOCRINOLOGY			English	Article							GLAND SCALED SCORE; HUMAN ADRENAL-MEDULLA; CHROMOGRANIN-A; MALIGNANT PHEOCHROMOCYTOMAS; PROHORMONE CONVERTASES; NEUROENDOCRINE TUMORS; PEPTIDE EM66; MOLECULAR-PROPERTIES; SECRETONEURIN; BENIGN	We have previously demonstrated that measurement of tissue concentrations of the secretogranin II (SgII or SCG2 as listed in the HUGO database)-derived peptide EM66 may help to discriminate between benign and malignant pheochromocytomas and that EM66 represents a sensitive plasma marker of pheochromocytomas. Here, we investigated the gene expression and protein production of SgII in 13 normal adrenal glands, and 35 benign and 16 malignant pheochromocytomas with the goal to examine the molecular mechanisms leading to the marked variations in the expression of EM66 in tumoral chromaffin tissue. EM66 peptide levels were 16-fold higher in benign than in malignant pheochromocytomas and had an area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve of 0.95 for the distinction of benign and malignant tumors. Q-PCR experiments indicated that the SgII gene was significantly underexpressed in malignant tumors compared with benign tumors. Western blot analysis using antisera directed against SgII and SgII-derived fragments revealed lower SgII protein and SgII-processing products in malignant tumors. Western blot also showed that low p-cAMP-responsive element-binding (CREB) concentrations seemed to be associated with the malignant status. In addition, the prohormone convertase PC1 and PC2 genes and proteins were overexpressed in benign pheochromocytomas compared with malignant pheochromocytomas. Low concentrations of EM66 found in malignant tumors are associated with reduced expression and production of SgII and SgII-derived peptides that could be ascribed to a decrease in SgII gene transcription, probably linked to p-CREB down-regulation, and to lower PC levels. These findings highlight the mechanisms leading to lower concentrations of EM66 in malignant pheochromocytoma and strengthen the notion that this peptide is a suitable marker of this neuroendocrine tumor.

TLN-4601 inhibits the Ras-MAPK signaling pathway, and in animal models crosses the blood-brain barrier and accumulates in implanted gliomas, possibly by binding specifically to the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor. A maximum of 40 patients with recurrent GBM were to be enrolled in this study. TLN-4601 was administered at a dose of 480 mg/m(2)/day by continuous intravenous (CIV) administration. Each 21-day cycle consisted of a 14-day CIV administration and a 7-day recovery period. Samples were obtained from all patients for pharmacokinetic evaluations (PK) and for Raf-1 and pERK biomarker assessment using immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry. Following enrollment of 20 patients, this study was terminated due to a lack of efficacy. Of 17 evaluable patients, 14 had MR scans performed after two cycles of TLN-4601. Of these 14 patients, three had stable disease and 11 had disease progression. Only three patients had MR scans performed after four cycles and all had evidence of radiographic progression. Serum PKs confirmed that patients were exposed to TLN-4601 at targeted drug levels. TLN-4601 was generally well tolerated although two patients discontinued treatment due to adverse events. Biomarker analysis did not show consistent changes. TLN-4601 infused via CIV at 480 mg/m(2)/day for 14 of 21 days is well tolerated by patients with progressive GBM. However, this agent is ineffective in progressive GBM when administered as monotherapy in this schedule.

Methods An electronic search of the literature was conducted using Medline, Embase, PsycInfo, CINAHL, ERIC, OT Seeker, and the Cochrane library using relevant MESH heading and key words. An inductive thematic analysis was used to synthesize main findings from the studies. The mixed methods appraisal tool (MMAT) was used to assess the methodological quality of the included studies. Results Nineteen studies were included in this systematic review. All 19 studies fulfilled most of the criteria outlined by the MMAT for each study design (quantitative, qualitative, and mixed methods). Mixed methods studies had the lowest MMAT scores. Seven themes were identified that further elucidate the important relationships between leisure participation and QoL: active physical leisure participation and physical well-being; leisure participation and self; leisure participation and emotional well-being; leisure participation and social well-being; leisure participation and cognition; leisure preferences and well-being; and negative aspects of leisure participation. Conclusions The use of thematic analysis enabled the synthesis of findings from quantitative, qualitative, and mixed methods study designs. Participating in both naturally occurring, spontaneous forms of leisure activities and participating in more structured types of leisure and therapeutic programs that focus on leisure contribute to improving the QoL of children with neurodevelopmental disabilities. A key aspect to consider is the child's ability to participate in his/her preferred leisure activities. Environmental adaptations may be required to ensure that the leisure opportunities meet the children's capabilities and contribute positively to their QoL.

Its purpose is to confirm the potential presence of micrometastases in the first lymph node basin. Therefore, staging of the melanoma can be determined. Somehow, only few studies assess the morbidity of this procedure. Our study was performed in order to list and analyze SLN biopsy-related complications in melanoma-affected patients. Patients and methods. - This mono-institutional, retrospective study enrolled patients, operated on from May 2001 until August 2008, who had undergone SLN biopsy that found no metastatic colonization. Patients with positive SLN biopsy underwent subsequent completion lymph node dissection (CLND) and, therefore, were not included in this study. Thus, CLND-related complications did not interfere with SLN biopsy-related ones. Median follow-up was 19 months. Results. - One hundred and twenty-seven patients, 58 men and 69 women were evaluated. Nine patients (7,1%) were diagnosed with one complication. We noticed seven early complications occurring during the first month (four seromas, one lymphocele, one infection with dehiscence of wound, one deep veinous thrombosis) and two late complications occurring beyond this period (one neuroma, one cicatricial bridle). Four (44%) among these complications arose in the groin. Conclusion. - SLN biopsy is known as a simple and minimally invasive surgical technique. Somehow, some potentially severe complications may arise. These must be clearly explained to obtain the patient's informed consent prior to surgery. (C) 2012 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

However, no previous study has identified the functional neural correlates of memory encoding in relation to remission. Aims To determine whether functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) activation patterns differed between individuals that later achieved remission v. those who did not. Method Forty-two participants with first-episode schizophrenia were divided into two groups after 1 year of treatment as per the 2005 remission in schizophrenia consensus definition. We then examined fMRI activation using three contrasts (associative v. item-oriented strategy, semantically unrelated v. related image pairs, and successful v. unsuccessful memory encoding) among 15 participants who had achieved remission (remitted group), 27 who had not (non-remitted group) and 31 healthy controls (control group). Results Participants in the non-remitted group displayed a positive activation in the posterior cingulate compared with those in the remitted group when encoding related images; no significant differences between the two groups were identified for the other contrasts. From the behavioural data, compared with the remitted and control groups, the non-remitted group demonstrated an inability to encode related images and displayed worse recognition memory overall. Conclusions This is the first study to identify differential neural activation between individuals with first-episode schizophrenia that later achieved remission v. those who did not. The behavioural and functional results together add to the growing evidence relating a poor clinical outcome in schizophrenia to memory-related deficits.

An inverse association between asthma and brain cancer was found in adults, but there is a dearth of studies in children. The goal of this study was to evaluate the association between asthma and brain cancer in children. Methods Two hundred and seventy-two cases of children with brain tumor diagnosed between 0 and 14 years of age in the Province of Quebec, Canada, between 1980 and 1999 and 272 incidence density-matched controls were included in the study. The parents of cases and controls were interviewed by phone using structured questionnaires. Besides asthma in children, family history of asthma, the presence of other atopies, and medication intake were also investigated. Conditional logistic regression was used to analyze the data. Results Brain tumor risk was decreased in children with asthma (OR, 0.55; CI 95%, 0.33-0.93), with eczema (OR, 0.52; CI 95%, 0.17-1.57), and with both asthma and eczema (OR, 0.76; CI 95%, 0.18-3.2). Maternal or sibling asthma did not modify the effect of asthma on central nervous system (CNS) tumors, while father's asthma seemed to increase the risk, but numbers were small. Antiasthma medications such as inhaled corticosteroid and beta agonists seemed to increase the risk of CNS tumors (OR for steroids, 2.55; CI 95%, 0.79-8.20 and OR for inhaled beta agonist, 1.62; CI 95%, 0.57-4.63). Conclusions This study strengthens the hypothesis of inverse association between asthma and brain cancer in children, but family history and medications for asthma need further investigation.

The proposed LoC is built around a CMOS full-custom chip and a microfluidic structure. The CMOS chip is used to deliver all parameters required to control the dielectrophoresis (DEP) features such as frequency, phase, and amplitude of signals spread on in-channel electrodes of the LoC. It is integrated to the LoC and experimental results are related to micro and nano particles manipulation and detection in a microfluidic platform. The proposed microsystem includes an on-chip 27-bit frequency divider, a digital phase controller with a 3.6 degrees phase shift resolution and a 2.5 V dynamic range. The sensing module is composed of a 3 3 capacitive sensor array with 10 fF per mV sensitivity, and a dynamic range of 1.5 V. The obtained results show an efficient nano and micro-particles (PC05N, PA04N and PS03N) separation based on frequency segregation with low voltages less than 1.7 V and a fully integrated and reconfigurable system.

Inhaled Fentanyl Citrate Improves Exercise Endurance During High-Intensity Constant Work Rate Cycle Exercise in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease	JOURNAL OF PAIN AND SYMPTOM MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Dyspnea; exercise; COPD; opioids; fentanyl citrate; nebulized; symptom management	CHRONIC LUNG-DISEASE; GUINEA-PIG AIRWAYS; DOSE NEBULIZED MORPHINE; CHOLINERGIC NEUROTRANSMISSION; OPIOID RECEPTORS; FLOW LIMITATION; HEALTH-STATUS; DYSPNEA; COPD; STANDARDIZATION	Context. Activity limitation and dyspnea are the dominant symptoms of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Traditionally, efforts to alleviate these symptoms have focused on improving ventilatory mechanics, reducing ventilatory demand, or both of these in combination. Nevertheless, many patients with COPD remain incapacitated by dyspnea and exercise intolerance despite optimal therapy. Objectives. To determine the effect of single-dose inhalation of nebulized fentanyl citrate (a m-opioid agonist drug) on exercise tolerance and dyspnea in COPD. Methods. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study, 12 stable patients with COPD (mean +/- standard error of the mean post-b2-agonist forced expiratory volume in one second [FEV1] and FEV1 to forced vital capacity ratio of 69% +/- 4% predicted and 49% +/- 3%, respectively) received either nebulized fentanyl citrate (50 mcg) or placebo on two separate days. After each treatment, patients performed pulmonary function tests and a symptom-limited constant work rate cycle exercise test at 75% of their maximum incremental work rate. Results. There were no significant postdose differences in spirometric parameters or plethysmographic lung volumes. Neither the intensity nor the unpleasantness of perceived dyspnea was, on average, significantly different at isotime (5.0 +/- 0.6 minutes) or at peak exercise after treatment with fentanyl citrate vs. placebo. Compared with placebo, fentanyl citrate was associated with 1) increased exercise endurance time by 1.30 +/- 0.43 minutes or 25% +/- 8% (P = 0.01); 2) small but consistent increases in dynamic inspiratory capacity by similar to 0.10 L at isotime and at peak exercise (both P <= 0.03); and 3) no concomitant change in ventilatory demand, breathing pattern, pulmonary gas exchange, and/or cardiometabolic function during exercise. The mean rate of increase in dyspnea intensity (1.2 +/- 0.3 vs. 2.9 +/- 0.8 Borg units/minute, P = 0.03) and unpleasantness ratings (0.5 +/- 0.2 vs. 2.9 +/- 1.3 Borg units/minute, P = 0.06) between isotime and peak exercise was less after treatment with fentanyl citrate vs. placebo. Conclusion. Single-dose inhalation of fentanyl citrate was associated with significant and potentially clinically important improvements in exercise tolerance in COPD. These improvements were accompanied by a delay in the onset of intolerable dyspnea during exercise near the limits of tolerance. J Pain Symptom Manage 2012; 43: 706-719.

A Validation Study of Multicenter Diffusion Tensor Imaging: Reliability of Fractional Anisotropy and Diffusivity Values	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY			English	Article							APPEARING WHITE-MATTER; MULTIPLE-SCLEROSIS; REPRODUCIBILITY; BRAIN; MRI; AGREEMENT; LESIONS; ECHO	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: DTI is increasingly being used as a measure to study tissue damage in several neurologic diseases. Our aim was to investigate the comparability of DTI measures between different MR imaging magnets and platforms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two healthy volunteers underwent DTI on five 31 MR imaging scanners (3 Trios and 2 Signas) by using a matched 33 noncollinear diffusion-direction pulse sequence. Within each subject, a total of 16 white matter (corpus callosum, periventricular, and deep white matter) and gray matter (cortical and deep gray) ROIs were drawn on a single image set and then were coregistered to the other images. Mean FA, ADC, and longitudinal and transverse diffusivities were calculated within each ROI. Concordance correlations were derived by comparing ROI DTI values among each of the 5 magnets. RESULTS: Mean concordance for FA was 0.96; for both longitudinal and transverse diffusivities, it was 0.93; and for ADC, it was 0.88. Mean scan-rescan concordance was 0.96-0.97 for all DTI measures. Concordance correlations within platforms were, in general, better than those between platforms for all DTI measures (mean concordance of 0.96). CONCLUSIONS: We found that a 3T magnet and high-angular-resolution pulse sequence yielded comparable DTI measurements across different MR imaging magnets and platforms. Our results indicate that FA is the most comparable measure across magnets, followed by individual diffusivities. The comparability of DTI measures between different magnets supports the feasibility of multicentered clinical trials by using DTI as an outcome measure.	[Fox, R.

As a result, a major pre-occupation of many neuroscientists has been in tracking down when and where nervous tissues express ion channels with appreciable divalent ion permeability. The cobalt (Co2+)-staining technique is one of the few techniques that allow a snapshot of the entire neuronal circuit, and selectively labels cells expressing divalent-permeable ion channels with a brownblack precipitate. Despite this, its use has been remarkably limited in the past decade. Reluctance to employ this approach has largely been related to an earlier concern with obtaining a reliable and reproducible means of visualizing transported Co2+. Here we show that recent advances have resolved these issues, opening this straightforward and valuable technique to a much larger neuroscience audience.	[Aurousseau, Mark R.

J	Huntgeburth, SC; Petrides, M				Huntgeburth, Sonja C.; Petrides, Michael			Morphological patterns of the collateral sulcus in the human brain	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						collateral sulcus; magnetic resonance imaging; stereotaxic space; sulcal patterns; sulcal variability	PARAHIPPOCAMPAL PLACE AREA; MEDIAL TEMPORAL-LOBE; HUMAN VISUAL-CORTEX; ENTORHINAL CORTEX; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; ORGANIZATION; HIPPOCAMPUS; MEMORY; ANATOMY; GYRUS	The collateral sulcal complex is an important landmark on the medial surface of the temporal lobe. Anteriorly, it delineates the limbic regions of the parahippocampal gyrus from the visual-processing areas of the fusiform gyrus. Posteriorly, it continues into the occipital lobe, bearing no relationship to the memory-related limbic regions. Given the considerable extent of the sulcus and functional heterogeneity of the surrounding cortex, an investigation of the morphology of this sulcus was carried out to examine whether it is continuous or a series of sulcal parts, i.e. independent sulci classified together under the name collateral sulcus. We investigated the collateral sulcal complex using magnetic resonance images taking into account the three-dimensional nature of the brain. Our examination demonstrated three separate sulcal segments: (i) an anterior segment, the rhinal sulcus, delineating the uncus from the adjacent temporal neocortex, (ii) a middle segment, the collateral sulcus proper, forming the lateral border of the posterior parahippocampal cortex, and (iii) a caudal segment, the occipital extent of the collateral sulcus, within the occipital lobe. Three relationships exist between the rhinal sulcus and collateral sulcus proper, only one being clearly identifiable from the surface. Posteriorly, the collateral sulcus proper and the occipital collateral sulcus, although appearing continuous on the brain surface, can be separated in the depth of the sulcus in all cases. These results provide quantification of the location and variability within standard stereotaxic space for the three collateral sulcus segments that could be used to aid accurate identification of functional activation peaks derived from neuroimaging studies.

Superoxide signaling and cell death in retinal ganglion cell axotomy: Effects of metallocorroles	EXPERIMENTAL EYE RESEARCH			English	Article						retinal ganglion cells; neuroprotection; apoptosis; in vivo imaging; reactive oxygen species	AXONAL INJURY; CORROLES; SURVIVAL; NEUROPROTECTION; COMPLEXES; ETHIDIUM; MODELS; ANION	Injury to retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons within the optic nerve causes apoptosis of the soma. We previously demonstrated that in vivo axotomy causes elevation of superoxide anion within the RCC soma, and that this occurs 1-2 days before annexin-V positivity, a marker of apoptosis. Pegylated superoxide dismutase delivery to the RGC prevents the superoxide elevation and rescues the soma. Together, these results imply that superoxide is an upstream signal for apoptosis after axonal injury in RGCs. We then studied metallocorroles, potent superoxide dismutase mimetics, which we had shown to be neuroprotective in vitro and superoxide scavengers in vivo for RGCs. RGCs were retrograde labeled with the fluorescent dye 4Di-10Asp, and then axotomized by intraorbital optic nerve transection. Iron(III) 2,17-bis-sulfonato-5,10,15-tris(pentafluorophenyl)corrole (Fe(tpfc)(SO3H)(2)) (Fe-corrole) was injected intravitreally. Longitudinal imaging of RGCs was performed and the number of surviving RGCs enumerated. There was significantly greater survival of labeled RGCs with Fe-corrole, but the degree of neuroprotection was relatively less than that predicted by their ability to scavenge superoxide-This implies an unexpected complexity in signaling of apoptosis by reactive oxygen species.

ITN STAyCIS Study Grp	Randomized controlled trial of atorvastatin in clinically isolated syndrome The STAyCIS study	NEUROLOGY			English	Article							REMITTING MULTIPLE-SCLEROSIS; INTRAMUSCULAR INTERFERON BETA-1A; SIMVASTATIN TREATMENT; STATINS; THERAPY; CELLS; AUTOIMMUNITY; COMBINATION; PARALYSIS; DISEASE	Objective: To test efficacy and safety of atorvastatin in subjects with clinically isolated syndrome (CIS). Methods: Subjects with CIS were enrolled in a phase II, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 14-center randomized trial testing 80 mg atorvastatin on clinical and brain MRI activity. Brain MRIs were performed quarterly. The primary endpoint (PEP) was development of >= 3new T2 lesions, or one clinical relapse within 12months. Subjects meeting the PEP were offered additional weekly interferon beta-1a (IFN beta-1a). Results: Due to slow recruitment, enrollment was discontinued after 81 of 152 planned subjects with CIS were randomized and initiated study drug. Median (interquartile range) numbers of T2 and gadolinium-enhancing (Gd) lesions were 15.0(22.0) and 0.0 (0.0) at baseline. A total of 53.1% of atorvastatin recipients (n = 26/49) met PEP compared to 56.3% of placebo recipients (n = 18/ 32) (p = 0.82). Eleven atorvastatin subjects (22.4%) and 7 placebo subjects (21.9%) met the PEP by clinical criteria. Proportion of subjects who did not develop new T2 lesions up to month 12 or to starting IFN beta-1a was 55.3% in the atorvastatin and 27.6% in the placebo group (p = 0.03). Likelihood of remaining free of new T2 lesions was significantly greater in the atorvastatin group compared with placebo (odds ratio [OR] = 4.34, p = 0.01). Likelihood of remaining free of Gd lesions tended to be higher in the atorvastatin group (OR = 2.72, p = 0.11). Overall, atorvastatin was well tolerated. No clear antagonistic effect of atorvastatin plus IFN beta-1a was observed on MRI measures. Conclusion: Atorvastatin treatment significantly decreased development of new brain MRI T2 lesion activity, although it did not achieve the composite clinical and imaging PEP. Classification of Evidence: This study provided Class II evidence that atorvastatin did not reduce the proportion of patients with CIS meeting imaging and clinical criteria for starting immunomodulating therapy after 12 months, compared to placebo. In an analysis of a secondary endpoint (Class III), atorvastatin was associated with a reduced risk for developing new T2 lesions.

Methods: A total of 115 subjects with PD were enrolled at 20 sites. Subjects were randomized to receive an SSRI (paroxetine; n = 42), an SNRI (venlafaxine extended release [XR]; n = 34), or placebo (n = 39). Subjects met DSM-IV criteria for a depressive disorder, or operationally defined subsyndromal depression, and scored > 12 on the first 17 items of the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D). Subjects were followed for 12 weeks (6-week dosage adjustment, 6-week maintenance). Maximum daily dosages were 40 mg for paroxetine and 225 mg for venlafaxine XR. The primary outcome measure was change in the HAM-D score from baseline to week 12. Results: Treatment effects (relative to placebo), expressed as mean 12-week reductions in HAM-D score, were 6.2 points (97.5% confidence interval [CI] 2.2 to 10.3, p = 0.0007) in the paroxetine group and 4.2 points (97.5% CI 0.1 to 8.4, p = 0.02) in the venlafaxine XR group. No treatment effects were seen on motor function. Conclusions: Both paroxetine and venlafaxine XR significantly improved depression in subjects with PD. Both medications were generally safe and well tolerated and did not worsen motor function. Classification of Evidence: This study provides Class I evidence that paroxetine and venlafaxine XR are effective in treating depression in patients with PD.

J	Heeley-Ray, T; Nemeth, J; Mitchell, J				Heeley-Ray, Tim; Nemeth, Joe; Mitchell, John			The Prevalence of Hypoglycemia in Children With Vomiting or Decreased Oral Intake and Irritability	PEDIATRIC EMERGENCY CARE			English	Article						hypoglycemia; neuroglycopenia; irritability	COMPLICATING DEHYDRATION; ACUTE GASTROENTERITIS; INFECTIOUS DIARRHEA; SUGAR	Objective: This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of hypoglycemia in children younger than 5 years presenting to the emergency department with vomiting or decreased oral intake and irritability. Methods: Children aged 1 month to 5 years presenting to the emergency department with vomiting (twice or more) or decreased oral intake (>50%) during the past 24 hours and irritability as part of the history of present illness were enrolled. Capillary blood glucose was obtained at triage. Patients with glucose level higher than 3.0 mmol/L were considered normoglycemic. Patients with glucose level of 3.0 mmol/L or lower were re-triaged (acuity level increased by 1), and sent to a treatment room with the recommendation that our institution's hypoglycemia protocol be applied. Results: Of the 145 enrolled patients, 2 were hypoglycemic, for an estimated prevalence of 1.4%. The mean capillary blood glucose level was 5.4 mmol/L, and the range was 2.8 to 11.8 mmol/L. The average age of participants was 21 months, and 48.3% were female. Most were triaged category 4 or 5, and the most common discharge diagnoses were gastroenteritis, viral illness, and vomiting not yet diagnosed. Conclusions: Hypoglycemia is a rare occurrence in all-comers younger than 5 years with vomiting or decreased oral intake, even with early signs of neuroglycopenia. Measuring the capillary glucose is better left to the discretion of the physician than as part of triage.

Distribution of metastatic sites in renal cell carcinoma: a population-based analysis	ANNALS OF ONCOLOGY			English	Article						brain metastases; bone metastases; metastatic disease; renal cell carcinoma; young age	PROGNOSTIC-FACTORS; ZOLEDRONIC ACID; BONE METASTASIS; FOLLOW-UP; SURVIVAL; CANCER; BRAIN; AGE; COMPLICATIONS; ADULTS	Background: We assessed the distribution of site-specific metastases in patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC) according to age. Moreover, we evaluated recommendations proposed by guidelines and focused specifically on bone and brain metastases. Patients and methods: Patients with metastatic RCC (mRCC) were abstracted from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (1998-2007). Age was stratified into four groups: <55, 55-64, 65-74 and >= 75 years. Cochran-Armitage trend test and multivariable logistic regression analysis tested the relationship between age and the rate of multiple metastatic sites. Finally, we examined the rates of brain or bone metastases according to the presence of other metastatic sites. Results: In 11 157 mRCC patients, the rate of multiple metastatic sites decreased with increasing age (P < 0.001). This phenomenon was confirmed in patients with lung, bone, liver and brain metastases (all P <= 0.01). The rate of bone metastases was 10% in patients with exclusive abdominal metastases and 49% in patients with abdominal, thoracic and brain metastases. The rate of brain metastases was 2% in patients with exclusive abdominal metastases and 16% in patients with thoracic and bone metastases. Conclusions: The proportion of patients with multiple metastatic sites is higher in young patients. The rates of bone (10%-49%) and brain (2%-16%) metastases are nonnegligible in mRCC patients.

Mitochondrial processing peptidase regulates PINK1 processing, import and Parkin recruitment	EMBO REPORTS			English	Article						mitochondria; mitophagy; Parkinson's disease PINK1; proteases	TOM COMPLEX; PROTEASE; PARL; MEMBRANE; DISEASE; MUTATIONS; PROTEINS; SUBUNITS; YEAST	Mutations in phosphatase and tensin homologue-induced kinase 1 (PINK1) cause recessively inherited Parkinson's disease (PD), a neurodegenerative disorder linked to mitochondrial dysfunction. In healthy mitochondria, PINK1 is rapidly degraded in a process involving both mitochondrial proteases and the proteasome. However, when mitochondrial import is compromised by depolarization, PINK1 accumulates on the mitochondrial surface where it recruits the PD-linked E3 ubiquitin ligase Parkin from the cytosol, which in turn mediates the autophagic destruction of the dysfunctional organelles. Using an unbiased RNA-mediated interference (RNAi)-based screen, we identified four mitochondrial proteases, mitochondrial processing peptidase (MPP), presenilin-associated rhomboid-like protease (PARL), m-AAA and ClpXP, involved in PINK1 degradation. We find that PINK1 turnover is particularly sensitive to even modest reductions in MPP levels. Moreover, PINK1 cleavage by MPP is coupled to import such that reducing MPP activity induces PINK1 accumulation at the mitochondrial surface, leading to Parkin recruitment and mitophagy. These results highlight a new role for MPP in PINK1 import and mitochondrial quality control via the PINK1-Parkin pathway.

Response Inhibition and Error Monitoring during a Visual Go/No-Go Task in Inuit Children Exposed to Lead, Polychlorinated Biphenyls, and Methylmercury	ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PERSPECTIVES			English	Article						event-related potentials; error monitoring; executive function; lead; methylmercury; neurotoxicity; polychlorinated biphenyls; response inhibition	ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; UMBILICAL-CORD BLOOD; PRENATAL EXPOSURE; POSTNATAL EXPOSURE; ARCTIC QUEBEC; PCB EXPOSURE; US CHILDREN; IN-UTERO; ATTENTION; INFANTS	BACKGROUND: Lead (Pb) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are neurotoxic contaminants that have been related to impairment in response inhibition. OBJECTIVES: In this study we examined the neurophysiological correlates of the response inhibition deficits associated with these exposures, using event-related potentials (ERPs) in a sample of school-age Inuit children from Arctic Quebec exposed through their traditional diet. METHODS: In a prospective longitudinal study, we assessed 196 children (mean age, 11.3 years) on a visual go/no-go response inhibition paradigm. Pb, PCB, and mercury (Hg) concentrations were analyzed in cord and current blood samples. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses were conducted to examine the associations of contaminant levels to go/no-go performance (mean reaction time, percent correct go, percent correct no-go) and five ERPs [N2, P3, error-related negativity, error positivity (Pe), and correct response positivity (Pc)] after control for confounding variables. RESULTS: Current blood Pb concentrations were associated with higher rates of false alarms and with decreased P3 amplitudes to go and no-go trials. Current plasma PCB-153 concentrations were associated with slower reaction times and with reduced amplitudes of the Pe and Pc response-related potentials. Hg concentrations were not related to any outcome on this task but showed significant interactions with other contaminants on certain outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that Pb exposure during childhood impairs the child's ability to allocate the cognitive resources needed to correctly inhibit a prepotent response, resulting in increased impulsivity. By contrast, postnatal PCB exposure appears to affect processes associated with error monitoring, an aspect of behavioral regulation required to adequately adapt to the changing demands of the environment, which results in reduced task efficiency.

Thyroid hormones and cognitive functioning in healthy, euthyroid women: A correlational study	HORMONES AND BEHAVIOR			English	Article						Thyroid hormones; Thyroid antibodies; Women; Cognition; Executive functions; Euthyroid	FRONTAL-LOBE LESIONS; L-THYROXINE TREATMENT; SUBCLINICAL HYPOTHYROIDISM; WORKING-MEMORY; GRAVES-DISEASE; ELECTROCONVULSIVE-THERAPY; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; DESIGN FLUENCY; OLD-AGE; BRAIN	Thyroid hormones (THs) play a critical role in differentiation, growth, and metabolism of animal and human organ systems, including the brain. Although associations between normal levels of THs and cognitive functions in healthy elderly individuals have been reported, the findings are inconsistent, possibly due to differences in study designs. Because thyroid disease occurs more frequently in women, the goal of the present study was to examine the relationship between levels of THs and performance on neuropsychological tests in 122 healthy, euthyroid women whose mean age was 51 years. Higher levels of free 13 were positively associated with longer completion times (slower performance) on Trail Making Test Part A (p = 0.006) and Part B (p = 0.032) and on the Tower of London test (p = 0.002). Higher levels of thyroglobulin antibodies (TgAb) were positively correlated with more errors on the Trail Making Test Part B (p = 0.000), on the Word Fluency test (p = 0.023), and on the Design Fluency test (p = 0.045). No significant correlations between TH levels and scores on mood, verbal memory, or working memory measures were observed. The findings point to a possible link between THs and cognitive processes that are mediated primarily by frontal cortex, areas associated with executive function tasks, and suggest that elevations in levels of free 13 and TgAB within the normal range may negatively influence executive functions.

Changes in Cardiac Biomarkers During Doxorubicin Treatment of Pediatric Patients With High-Risk Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia: Associations With Long-Term Echocardiographic Outcomes	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ONCOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Scientific Sessions of the American-Heart-Association on Resuscitation Science Symposium	NOV 13-17, 2010	Chicago, IL	Amer Heart Assoc			BRAIN NATRIURETIC PEPTIDE; C-REACTIVE PROTEIN; CORONARY-HEART-DISEASE; HIGH-DOSE CHEMOTHERAPY; DEPENDENT FOLLOW-UP; PROGNOSTIC VALUE; CARDIOVASCULAR EVENTS; MYOCARDIAL INJURY; CHILDHOOD-CANCER; TROPONIN-I	Purpose Doxorubicin causes cardiac injury and cardiomyopathy in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Measuring biomarkers during therapy might help individualize treatment by immediately identifying cardiac injury and cardiomyopathy. Patients and Methods Children with high-risk ALL were randomly assigned to receive doxorubicin alone (n = 100; 75 analyzed) or doxorubicin with dexrazoxane (n = 105; 81 analyzed). Echocardiograms and serial serum measurements of cardiac troponin T (cTnT; cardiac injury biomarker), N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP; cardiomyopathy biomarker), and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP; inflammatory biomarker) were obtained before, during, and after treatment. Results cTnT levels were increased in 12% of children in the doxorubicin group and in 13% of the doxorubicin-dexrazoxane group before treatment but in 47% and 13%, respectively, after treatment (P = .005). NT-proBNP levels were increased in 89% of children in the doxorubicin group and in 92% of children in the doxorubicin-dexrazoxane group before treatment but in only 48% and 20%, respectively, after treatment (P = .07). The percentage of children with increased hsCRP levels did not differ between groups at any time. In the first 90 days of treatment, detectable increases in cTnT were associated with abnormally reduced left ventricular (LV) mass and LV end-diastolic posterior wall thickness 4 years later (P < .01); increases in NT-proBNP were related to an abnormal LV thickness-to-dimension ratio, suggesting LV remodeling, 4 years later (P = .01). Increases in hsCRP were not associated with any echocardiographic variables. Conclusion cTnT and NT-proBNP may hold promise as biomarkers of cardiotoxicity in children with high-risk ALL. Definitive validation studies are required to fully establish their range of clinical utility.

The Relationship between Normal Cerebral Perfusion Patterns and White Matter Lesion Distribution in 1,249 Patients with Multiple Sclerosis	JOURNAL OF NEUROIMAGING			English	Article						Perfusion; MRI; white matter lesion; multiple sclerosis; SPECT	QUANTITATIVE FOLLOW-UP; DIAGNOSTIC-CRITERIA; MRI; BRAIN; HYPERINTENSITIES; REPRODUCIBILITY; ABNORMALITIES; IMPAIRMENT; DISABILITY; SYSTEM	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE The pathological differences underlying the clinical disease phases in multiple sclerosis (MS) are poorly characterized. We sought to explore the relationship between the distribution of white matter (WM) lesions in relapsing-remitting (RR) and secondary progressive (SP) MS and the normal regional variability of cerebral perfusion. METHODS WM lesions were identified and quantified on a single magnetic resonance imaging scan from 1,249 patients with MS. The spatial distribution of lesions was compared between early RR, late RR, and SP MS in the context of normal cerebral perfusion patterns provided by a single-photon emission-computed tomography atlas of healthy individuals. RESULTS Patients with SP MS had more distinct and larger lesions than patients with RR MS. Across all subjects, lesions were present in regions of relatively lower normal perfusion than normal appearing WM. Further, lesions in SP MS were more common in areas of lower perfusion as compared to the lesion distribution in early and late RR MS. CONCLUSION Chronic plaques were more prevalent in WM regions with lower relative perfusion. Lesions in more highly perfused regions were more commonly observed in early RR MS and therefore, may be more likely to successfully remyelinate and resolve.

Genetically determined P2X7 receptor pore formation regulates variability in chronic pain sensitivity	NATURE MEDICINE			English	Article							SPARED NERVE INJURY; NEUROPATHIC PAIN; SPINAL-CORD; P2X(7); MOUSE; NOCICEPTION; ANTAGONIST; COMPLEX; RAT; INTERLEUKIN-1-BETA	Chronic pain is highly variable between individuals, as is the response to analgesics. Although much of the variability in chronic pain and analgesic response is heritable, an understanding of the genetic determinants underlying this variability is rudimentary(1). Here we show that variation within the coding sequence of the gene encoding the P2X7 receptor (P2X7R) affects chronic pain sensitivity in both mice and humans. P2X7Rs, which are members of the family of ionotropic ATP-gated receptors, have two distinct modes of function: they can function through their intrinsic cationic channel or by forming nonselective pores that are permeable to molecules with a mass of up to 900 Da(2,3). Using genome-wide linkage analyses, we discovered an association between nerve-injury-induced pain behavior (mechanical allodynia) and the P451L mutation of the mouse P2rx7 gene, such that mice in which P2X7Rs have impaired pore formation as a result of this mutation showed less allodynia than mice with the pore-forming P2rx7 allele. Administration of a peptide corresponding to the P2X7R C-terminal domain, which blocked pore formation but not cation channel activity, selectively reduced nerve injury and inflammatory allodynia only in mice with the pore-forming P2rx7 allele. Moreover, in two independent human chronic pain cohorts, a cohort with pain after mastectomy and a cohort with osteoarthritis, we observed a genetic association between lower pain intensity and the hypofunctional His270 (rs7958311) allele of P2RX7. Our findings suggest that selectively targeting P2X7R pore formation may be a new strategy for individualizing the treatment of chronic pain.

Meta-analyses of cognitive and motor function in youth aged 16 years and younger who subsequently develop schizophrenia	PSYCHOLOGICAL MEDICINE			English	Article						Child; high-risk; intelligence; psychosis; school performance	PREMORBID INTELLECTUAL-PERFORMANCE; PROSPECTIVE BIRTH COHORT; POPULATION-BASED COHORT; 28-YEAR FOLLOW-UP; HIGH-RISK PROJECT; SCHOOL PERFORMANCE; ADULT SCHIZOPHRENICS; SPECTRUM DISORDER; BIPOLAR DISORDER; NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL PERFORMANCE	Background. Previous reviews have reported cognitive and motor deficits in childhood and adolescence among individuals who later develop schizophrenia. However, these reviews focused exclusively on studies of individuals with affected relatives or on population/birth cohorts, incorporated studies with estimated measures of pre-morbid intelligence, or included investigations that examined symptomatic at-risk participants or participants 18 years or older. Thus, it remains unclear whether cognitive and motor deficits constitute robust antecedents of schizophrenia. Meta-analyses were conducted on published studies that examined cognitive or motor function in youth aged 16 years or younger who later developed schizophrenia or a schizophrenia spectrum disorder (SSD) and those who did not. Method. Twenty-three studies fulfilled the following inclusion criteria : (1) written in English; (2) prospective investigations of birth or genetic high-risk cohorts, or follow-back investigations of population samples; (3) objective measures of cognitive or motor performance at age 16 or younger; (4) results provided for individuals who did and who did not develop schizophrenia/SSD later in life; and (5) sufficient data to calculate effect sizes. Four domains of function were examined: IQ; Motor Function; General Academic Achievement; and Mathematics Achievement. Results. Meta-analyses showed that, by age 16, individuals who subsequently developed schizophrenia/SSD displayed significant deficits in IQ (d=0.51) and motor function (d=0.56), but not in general academic achievement (d=0.25) or mathematics achievement (d=0.21). Subsidiary analysis indicated that the IQ deficit was present by age 13. Conclusions. These results demonstrate that deficits in IQ and motor performance precede the prodrome and the onset of illness.	[Dickson, H.; Laurens, K. R.; Cullen, A.

A well-known example is their accumulation in leukocytes upon activation by pro-inflammatory stimuli such as lipopolysaccharides (LPS) derived from gram-negative bacteria. A role of LDs and LD-associated proteins during inflammation in the brain is unknown, however. We have now studied their dynamics and regulation in microglia, the resident immune cells in the brain. We find that LPS treatment of microglia leads to the accumulation in them of LDs, and enhancement of the size of LDs. This induction of LDs was abolished by triacsin C, an inhibitor of triglyceride biosynthesis. LPS strongly activated c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 MAPK stress signaling pathways and increased the expression of LD-associated protein perilipin-2 (ADRP) in a time-dependent manner. Immunostaining showed that perilipin-2 in LPS-treated microglia predominantly colocalized with LDs. Inhibitors of p38 alpha/beta (SB203580) and PI3K/Akt pathway (LY294002), but not that of JNK (SP600125), reduced LPS-induced LD accumulation and eliminated the activating effect of LPS on perilipin-2. In addition, cytosolic phospholipase A(2) (cPLA(2)-alpha), a key enzyme for arachidonic acid release, colocalized with LPS-induced LDs. These observations suggest that LDs may play an important role in eicosanoid synthesis in activated microglia: they provide a novel insight into the regulation of LDs in inflammatory cells of the brain and point to a potential role of p38 alpha/beta in LPS-induced LD accumulation. Collectively, our findings imply that LD formation and perilipin-2 induction could be microglial biomarkers of inflammation in the central nervous system. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A current model of the underlying pathological processes contributing to the loss of motor function after stroke has motivated a number of research groups to investigate the potential therapeutic application of brain stimulation to stroke rehabilitation. The loss of motor function is modeled as resulting from a combination of reduced excitability in the lesioned motor cortex and an increased inhibitory drive from the nonlesioned hemisphere over the lesioned hemisphere. This combination of impaired neural function and pathological suppression resonates with current views on the cause of the visual impairment in amblyopia. Here, we discuss how the rationale for using noninvasive brain stimulation in stroke rehabilitation can be applied to amblyopia, review a proof-of-principle study demonstrating that brain stimulation can temporarily improve amblyopic eye function, and propose future research avenues.

This study refines the existing Breast-GPA by analyzing a larger cohort and tumor subtype. Methods and Materials: A multi-institutional retrospective database of 400 breast cancer patients treated for newly diagnosed brain metastases was generated. Prognostic factors significant for survival were analyzed by multivariate Cox regression and recursive partitioning analysis (RPA). Factors were weighted by the magnitude of their regression coefficients to define the GPA index. Results: Significant prognostic factors by multivariate Cox regression and RPA were Karnofsky performance status (KPS), HER2, ER/PR status, and the interaction between ER/PR and HER2. RPA showed age was significant for patients with KPS 60 to 80. The median survival time (MST) overall was 13.8 months, and for GPA scores of 0 to 1.0, 1.5 to 2.0, 2.5 to 3.0, and 3.5 to 4.0 were 3.4 (n = 23), 7.7 (n = 104), 15.1 (n = 140), and 25.3 (n = 133) months, respectively (p < 0.0001). Among HER2-negative patients, being ER/PR positive improved MST from 6.4 to 9.7 months, whereas in HER2-positive patients, being ER/PR positive improved MST from 17.9 to 20.7 months. The log-rank statistic (predictive power) was 110 for the Breast-GPA vs. 55 for tumor subtype. Conclusions: The Breast-GPA documents wide variation in prognosis and shows clear separation between subgroups of patients with breast cancer and brain metastases. This tool will aid clinical decision making and stratification in clinical trials. These data confirm the effect of tumor subtype on survival and show the Breast-GPA offers significantly more predictive power than the tumor subtype alone. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Bruce			Indication of BOLD-specific venous flow-volume changes from precisely controlled hyperoxic vs. hypercapnic calibration	JOURNAL OF CEREBRAL BLOOD FLOW AND METABOLISM			English	Article						BOLD calibration; end-tidal control; flow-volume relationship; hypercapnic; hyperoxic	CEREBRAL-BLOOD-FLOW; OXYGEN-METABOLISM CHANGES; OXIDATIVE-METABOLISM; VISUAL-STIMULATION; NEURAL ACTIVITY; FUNCTIONAL MRI; IN-VIVO; FMRI; ARTERIAL; SIGNAL	Deriving cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen consumption (CMRO2) from blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signals involves a flow-volume parameter (alpha), reflecting total cerebral blood volume changes, and a calibration constant (M). Traditionally, the former is assumed a fixed value and the latter is measured under alterations in fixed inspired fractional concentrations of carbon dioxide. We recently reported on reductions in M-variability via precise control of end-tidal pressures of both hypercapnic (HC) and hyperoxic (HO) gases. In light of these findings, our aim was to apply the improved calibration alternatives to neuronal activation, making use of their distinct vasoactive natures to evaluate the alpha-value. Nine healthy volunteers were imaged at 3 T while simultaneously measuring BOLD and arterial spin-labeling signals during controlled, graded, HC, and HO, followed by visual (VC) and sensorimotor cortices (SMC) activation. On the basis of low M- and CMRO2-variability, the comparison of these calibration alternatives accurately highlighted a reduced venous flow-volume relationship (alpha = 0.16 +/- 0.02, with alpha(VC) = 0.12 +/- 0.04, and alpha(SMC) = 0.20 +/- 0.02), as appropriate for BOLD modeling.

A total of 98 infants were analyzed. At enrollment, +PB infants had a higher rate of severe hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy and clinical seizures and lower T-e and cord pH than infants that have not received phenobarbital (-PB). There was a significant effect of phenobarbital itself and an interaction between phenobarbital and time in the T-e profile. Mean T-e in the +PB group was lower than in the -PB group, and the differences decreased over time. In +PB infants, the time to surpass target T-e of 33.5 degrees C and to reach the minimum T-e during overshoot were shorter. In conclusion, the administration of phenobarbital before cooling was associated with changes that may reflect a reduced thermogenic response associated with barbiturates.

Circadian Modulation of Osmoregulated Firing in Rat Supraoptic Nucleus Neurones	JOURNAL OF NEUROENDOCRINOLOGY			English	Review						suprachiasmatic nucleus; vasopressin; supraoptic nucleus; organum vasculosum lamina terminalis; presynaptic inhibition; circadian; osmoregulation	VASCULOSUM LAMINA TERMINALIS; HYPOTHALAMIC MAGNOCELLULAR NEURONS; SUPRACHIASMATIC NUCLEUS; ORGANUM VASCULOSUM; IN-VITRO; VASOPRESSIN SECRETION; SYNAPTIC-TRANSMISSION; PLASMA VASOPRESSIN; PRESYNAPTIC MODULATION; ANTIDIURETIC-HORMONE	The antidiuretic hormone vasopressin (VP) promotes water reabsorption from the kidney and levels of circulating VP are normally related linearly to plasma osmolality, aiming to maintain the latter close to a predetermined set point. Interestingly, VP levels rise also in the absence of an increase in osmolality during late sleep in various mammals, including rats and humans. This circadian rhythm is functionally important because the absence of a late night VP surge results in polyuria and disrupts sleep in humans. Previous work has indicated that the VP surge may be caused by facilitation of the central processes mediating the osmotic control of VP release, and the mechanism by which this occurs was recently studied in angled slices of rat hypothalamus that preserve intact network interactions between the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN; the biological clock), the organum vasculosum lamina terminalis (OVLT; the central osmosensory nucleus) and the supraoptic nucleus (SON; which contains VP-releasing neurohypophysial neurones). These studies confirmed that the electrical activity of SCN clock neurones is higher during the middle sleep period (MSP) than during the late sleep period (LSP). Moreover, they revealed that the excitation of SON neurones caused by hyperosmotic stimulation of the OVLT was greater during the LSP than during the MSP. Activation of clock neurones by repetitive electrical stimulation, or by injection of glutamate into the SCN, caused a presynaptic inhibition of glutamatergic synapses made between the axon terminals of OVLT neurones and SON neurones. Consistent with this effect, activation of clock neurones with glutamate also reduced the excitation of SON neurones caused by hyperosmotic stimulation of the OVLT. These results suggest that clock neurones in the SCN can mediate an increase in VP release through a disinhibition of excitatory synapses between the OVLT and the SON during the LSP.	[Bourque, C.

Functional OT receptors have been discovered in the rat and human heart, as well as in vascular beds. The cardiovascular activities of OT include: (i) lowering blood pressure; (ii) negative cardiac inotropy and chronotropy; (iii) parasympathetic neuromodulation; (iv) vasodilatation; (v) anti-inflammatory; (vi) antioxidative; and (vii) metabolic effects. These outcomes are mediated, at least in part, by stimulating cardioprotective mediators, such as nitric oxide and atrial natriuretic peptide. OT and its extended form OT-Gly-Lys-Arg have been shown to be abundant in the foetal mouse heart. OT has the capacity to generate cardiomyocytes from various types of stem cells, including the cardiac side population. Mesenchymal cells transfected with OT-Gly-Lys-Arg, or preconditioned with OT, are resistant to apoptosis and express endothelial cell markers. OT increases glucose uptake in cultured cardiomyocytes from newborn and adult rats, in normal, hypoxic and even insulin resistance conditions. In rats with experimentally-induced myocardial infarction, continuous in vivo OT delivery improves the cardiac healing process, as well as cardiac work, reduces inflammation and stimulates angiogenesis. Therefore, in pathological conditions, OT exerts anti-inflammatory and cardioprotective properties, and improves vascular and metabolic functions. Thus, OT has potential for therapeutic use.

One of the most difficult dilemmas in relationship science and couple therapy concerns the interaction between sexual desire and love. As two mental states of intense longing for union with others, sexual desire and love are, in fact, often difficult to disentangle from one another. Aim. The present review aims to help understand the differences and similarities between these two mental states using a comprehensive statistical meta-analyses of all functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies on sexual desire and love. Methods. Systematic retrospective review of pertinent neuroimaging literature. Main Outcome Measures. Review of published literature on fMRI studies illustrating brain regions associated with love and sexual desire to date. Results. Sexual desire and love not only show differences but also recruit a striking common set of brain areas that mediate somatosensory integration, reward expectation, and social cognition. More precisely, a significant posteriorto- anterior insular pattern appears to track sexual desire and love progressively. Conclusions. This specific pattern of activation suggests that love builds upon a neural circuit for emotions and pleasure, adding regions associated with reward expectancy, habit formation, and feature detection. In particular, the shared activation within the insula, with a posterior-to-anterior pattern, from desire to love, suggests that love grows out of and is a more abstract representation of the pleasant sensorimotor experiences that characterize desire. From these results, one may consider desire and love on a spectrum that evolves from integrative representations of affective visceral sensations to an ultimate representation of feelings incorporating mechanisms of reward expectancy and habit learning.

Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder (HSDD) is the most common form of Female Sexual Dysfunction and is characterized by low sexual desire that causes distress. Aim. The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of flibanserin, a postsynaptic 5-HT1A agonist/5-HT2A antagonist, in premenopausal women with HSDD. Methods. North American premenopausal women with HSDD were randomized to 24 weeks' treatment with placebo (N = 295), flibanserin 50 mg (N = 295), or flibanserin 100 mg (N = 290), once daily at bedtime. Main Outcome Measures. Coprimary endpoints were change from baseline to study end in number of satisfying sexual events (SSE) and sexual desire score measured daily using an electronic diary (eDiary). Secondary endpoints included change from baseline to study end in Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) desire domain and total scores, Female Sexual Distress Scale-Revised (FSDS-R) Item 13 and total scores, and Patient's Global Impression of Improvement. Results. Flibanserin 50 mg and 100 mg led to increases in SSE (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01 vs. placebo, respectively). There was a numerical trend toward improvement in eDiary desire score on flibanserin 100 mg, but statistical significance was not reached (P = 0.07 vs. placebo). FSFI desire domain and total scores increased with both flibanserin regimens (P < 0.05). FSDS-R total and Item 13 scores decreased with flibanserin 100 mg (P < 0.001), indicating reduced sexual distress. More women receiving flibanserin 50 mg and 100 mg considered their HSDD to have improved than women receiving placebo (39.6% and 50.0% vs. 30.3%, respectively) (P < 0.05). Conclusion. In premenopausal women with HSDD, flibanserin 50 mg and 100 mg once daily at bedtime were well tolerated and associated with statistically significant improvements in SSE, sexual desire (FSFI desire domain score but not eDiary desire score) and overall sexual function, and reduction of sexual distress, vs. placebo.

The mechanism by which oxytocin influences social behavior is not well understood. We explored the hypothesis that oxytocin alters how people perceive themselves, which could be one mechanism by which oxytocin promotes prosocial behavior. In a between-subject, randomized, and double-blind experiment, 100 university students received a 24 I.U. dose of intranasal oxytocin or placebo, and then completed the Revised NEO Personality Inventory (NEO-PI-R) and other self-report measures 90 min later. Intranasal oxytocin increased ratings of NEO-PI-R extraversion and openness to experiences [F(1,98) = 4.910, p = .025, partial eta (2) = .05; F(1,98) = 6.021, p = .016, partial eta (2) = .06], particularly for the following facets: positive emotions (d = 0.48, p < .05), warmth (d = 0.47, p < .05), openness to values (d = 0.45, p < .05) and ideas (d = 0.40, p < .05), trust (d = 0.44, p < .05), and altruism (d = 0.40, p < .05). Oxytocin had no influence on ratings of negative emotionality, conscientiousness, rejection sensitivity, depression, worry, self-esteem, and perceived social support. The administration of oxytocin improved participants' self-perceptions of their personality, at least for certain traits important for social affiliation. Increased positive self-referential processing may be one mechanism by which oxytocin promotes positive social behaviors.

Temporal trends of admission rates for 5193 twins and triplets < 33 weeks' gestational age to participating NICUs in the Canadian Neonatal Network between 2003 and 2008 were assessed. Trends in infant outcomes were evaluated using logistic regression. The proportion of twins increased from 26.1 to 28.0 per 100 admissions between 2003 and 2008 (7% increase, p = 0.02). In contrast, the proportion of triplets decreased from 5.0 to 3.3 per 100 admissions (34% reduction, p = 0.04). These trends were significant in mothers >= 35 years of age. Neonatal outcomes improved for preterm twins (mortality, p < 0.01; survival without any major morbidity, p < 0.01; severe neurological injury, p = 0.02; and severe retinopathy of prematurity, p = 0.03). Similar improvements were observed for triplets, but the sample size was insufficient to reach statistical significance. The rate of NICU admissions for preterm twins at < 33 weeks' gestation has increased in recent years, whereas for triplets it has gradually declined. Neonatal outcomes of preterm twins improved over the study period.

Overlapping and Segregating Structural Brain Abnormalities in Twins With Schizophrenia or Bipolar Disorder	ARCHIVES OF GENERAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Article							CHILDHOOD-ONSET SCHIZOPHRENIA; MATTER VOLUME ABNORMALITIES; MENTAL-HEALTH SURVEY; WHITE-MATTER; CORTICAL THICKNESS; UNAFFECTED RELATIVES; GENERAL-POPULATION; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; 1ST EPISODE; MR-IMAGES	Context: The nosologic dichotomy between schizophrenia and bipolar disorder (BD) as formulated by Kraepelin is currently being questioned, stimulated by the finding that schizophrenia and BD partly share a common genetic origin. Although both disorders are characterized by changes in brain structure, family studies suggest more segregating than overlapping neuroanatomical abnormalities in both disorders. Objectives: To investigate whether patients with schizophrenia and patients with BD display overlapping abnormalities in brain volumes and cortical thickness and whether these are caused by shared genetic or environmental influences. Design: Magnetic resonance imaging findings of monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs discordant for schizophrenia, twin pairs concordant and discordant for BD, and healthy twin pairs were compared using structural equation modeling. Setting: The Netherlands Twin Register and University Medical Center Utrecht. Participants: A total of 310 individuals from 158 (152 complete and 6 incomplete) twin pairs were included: 26 pairs discordant for schizophrenia (13 MZ and 13 DZ), 49 pairs with BD (9 MZ and 4 DZ concordant; 14 MZ and 22 DZ discordant), and 83 healthy twin pairs (44 MZ and 39 DZ). Main Outcome Measures: Estimates of additive genetic and unique environmental associations between schizophrenia and BD with overlapping and nonoverlapping volumes and cortical thickness. Results: Higher genetic liabilities for schizophrenia and BD were associated with smaller white matter volume, thinner right (and left) parahippocampus, thinner right orbitofrontal cortex, and thicker temporoparietal and left superior motor cortices; higher environmental liabilities were associated with thinner right medial occipital cortex. Genetic liability for schizophrenia was associated with thicker right parietal cortex; for BD, with larger intracranial volume. Conclusions: Brain structures reflect overlapping and segregating genetic liabilities for schizophrenia and BD. The overlapping smaller white matter volume and common areas of thinner cortex suggest that both disorders share genetic (neurodevelopmental) roots.	[Pol, Hilleke E. Hulshoff; van Baal, G.

We examined in C57/BL6 mice the effects of repeated juvenile methylphenidate (MPH) exposure on cocaine-reward sensitivity in adulthood and determined whether early MPH treatment alters adult expression of DCC in mesocorticolimbic DA regions. By using place conditioning, we show that adult mice exposed to MPH during the juvenile period are less sensitive to cocaine-reward compared to saline-controls. Furthermore, by means of immunoblotting, we demonstrate that early MPH treatment attenuates adult DCC expression in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) selectively. These results support previous evidence that developmental MPH treatment diminishes cocaine-reward in adulthood and are the first to suggest that DCC in the VTA may participate in this enduring effect.

The early-life social environment and DNA methylation	CLINICAL GENETICS			English	Article						DNA methylation; early life; epigenetics; social environment	EMBRYONIC STEM-CELLS; DE-NOVO METHYLATION; STRESS RESPONSES; GLUCOCORTICOID-RECEPTOR; ACTIVE DEMETHYLATION; MATERNAL-BEHAVIOR; PATERNAL GENOME; MYELOID CANCERS; EUKARYOTIC DNA; SUICIDE BRAIN	DNA methylation is a chemical modification of DNA that confers, upon identical sequences, different identities that are reflected in different gene expression programming. DNA methylation has a well-established role in cellular differentiation by providing a mechanism for one genome to express multiple phenotypes in a multicellular organism. Recent data point however to the possibility that in addition to the innate process of cellular differentiation, DNA methylation can serve as a genome adaptation mechanism, adapting genome function to changing environmental contexts including social environments. A critical time point for this process is early life when cues from the social and physical environments define lifelong trajectories of physical and mental health. DNA methylation and additional epigenetic modifications could therefore serve as molecular links between ` nurture' and ` nature'. Data that are consistent with this new role for DNA methylation as a mechanism for conferring an ` environment' specific identity to DNA will be discussed.

Levamisole in cocaine: Unexpected news from an old acquaintance	CLINICAL TOXICOLOGY			English	Review						Agranulocytosis; Neutropenia; Vasculitis; Cutaneous vasculopathy; Leukoencephalopathy	MULTIFOCAL INFLAMMATORY LEUKOENCEPHALOPATHY; ADULTERATED COCAINE; RHEUMATOID-ARTHRITIS; CONTAMINATED-COCAINE; RETIFORM PURPURA; TAINTED COCAINE; SKIN NECROSIS; CIRCULATING AUTOANTIBODIES; INDUCED HYPERSENSITIVITY; NECROTIZING VASCULITIS	Levamisole is a pharmaceutical with anthelminthic and immunomodulatory properties that was previously used in both animals and humans to treat inflammatory conditions and cancer. Levamisole has been identified as a cocaine adulterant in the United States since 2003. By 2009, the United States Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) estimated that 69% of the cocaine seized contained levamisole. The first case reports of complications related to levamisole in cocaine users were published in 2009. The objectives of this article are to review the literature regarding the full spectrum of possible complications related to levamisole use for medical purposes, to review the current scope of levamisole-induced complications in cocaine users and to discuss the pharmacological properties that might explain the motivation behind the large-scale adulteration of cocaine with levamisole. Literature review revealed that significant complications were quickly reported when levamisole was used in inflammatory conditions. By 1976, several cases of leukopenia and agranulocytosis were reported. Recurrence with re-exposure was well described and agranulocytosis spontaneously reversed upon discontinuation of therapy. Vasculitis secondary to levamisole treatment was first reported in 1978 and mostly manifests as leukocytoclastic vasculitis, cutaneous necrotising vasculitis and thrombotic vasculopathy without vasculitis. These findings typically, but not invariably, involve the ear lobes. Discontinuation of levamisole therapy was again a critical part of the treatment. Various neurological side effects were described with levamisole therapy, the most concerning complication being multifocal inflammatory leukoencephalopathy (MIL). Literature review identified 203 unique cases of complications in cocaine users that can be attributed to levamisole adulteration. The two principal complications reported are haematological (140 cases of neutropenia) and dermatological (84 cases). Even though these complications can occur in isolation, many cases displayed both simultaneously. No formal case of leukoencephalopathy in the setting of cocaine use has been reported so far. A striking phenomenon is the apparent high level of recurrence (27.1%) of symptoms in cocaine users after re-exposure to cocaine that is presumably adulterated. The importance of accurately identifying levamisole-induced complications is therefore critical for symptomatic patients as discontinuation of exposure is fundamental and as a correct diagnosis prevents unnecessary and potentially dangerous use of other treatment modalities like powerful immunosuppressive therapy. Literature review suggests that levamisole might have the advantages of enhancing noradrenergic neurotransmission by inhibiting reuptake, by inhibiting MAO and/or COMT, by acting on ganglionic nicotinic receptors and by being partially metabolized into an amphetamine-like compound. It could also increase endogenous opioids and increase dopamine concentration in the cerebral reward pathway. These potential effects make levamisole an interesting choice as a cocaine adulterant. It seems unlikely that levamisole use as a cocaine adulterant will soon reach an end. More information is needed about the diagnosis and treatment of levamisole-induced complications, and the efforts of the medical and public health community is needed to face this challenging problem.

J	Talbot, S; Couture, R				Talbot, Sebastien; Couture, Rejean			Emerging role of microglial kinin B1 receptor in diabetic pain neuropathy	EXPERIMENTAL NEUROLOGY			English	Article							BRADYKININ B-1 RECEPTOR; PERIPHERAL-NERVE INJURY; NF-KAPPA-B; ACTIVATED PROTEIN-KINASE; HUMAN LUNG FIBROBLASTS; EXPERIMENTAL RAT MODEL; SPINAL-CORD MICROGLIA; NITRIC-OXIDE SYNTHASE; TOLL-LIKE RECEPTOR-4; GLIAL TNF-ALPHA	Nowadays diabetes mellitus has reached epidemic level and is considered as the primary cause of foot amputation and pain neuropathy. The classical theories explaining the development of diabetic pain neuropathy include the imbalance of neuronal biochemical pathways (Polyol pathway, Na+/K+ ATPase pump, AGE, ROS) and microangiopathy which promote nerve fibers depolarization, sensitization, ectopic discharges, demyelization and ultimately neuronal death. However, the current pharmacotherapy targeting those pathways brings variable, not always satisfactory and temporal relief in patients experiencing diabetic pain neuropathy. Interestingly, recent research in animal models yielded compelling evidence that glial cells, mainly microglia, play a critical role in the mediation of diabetic pain facilitation mechanisms. Preventing microglia activation could therefore be considered as a potential therapeutic target. The lack of specific agents inhibiting microglia activity remains, however, a major obstacle for further treatment in diabetic patients. An alternative and new strategy would be the targeting of key mediators involved in microglia activation, migration and the subsequent release of pro-inflammatory substances contributing to neuronal hyperexitability. The present review summarizes recent evidence that the kinin B1 receptor (B1R) may represent such a target of potential value for new medicines in the treatment of chronic pain. A few selective B1R antagonists have been fully characterized in animal models although small molecules orally active are urgently needed for targeting human B1R on CNS microglia. Thus far, the pharmacological blockade of kinin B1R in various animal paradigms or its genetic deletion in B1R knock-out mice failed to cause unwanted side effects, making this approach feasible. This is consistent with the highly inducible feature of this atypical G-protein coupled receptor whose expression can be seen as the alarming signature of immune and inflammatory diseases, notably diabetes mellitus.

Peripheral nerve injury increases BDNF expression in DRG neurons, an event involved in the genesis of neuropathic pain. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) overproduced in injured nerves contributes to the up-regulation of BDNF in DRG neurons. Two weeks after partial sciatic nerve ligation (PSNL). BDNF levels in the ipsilateral L4-L6 DRG of injured rats were significantly increased compared to the contralateral side. Perineural injection of a selective cyclooxygenase (COX2) inhibitor or a PGE2 EP4 receptor antagonist not only dose-dependently relieved PSNL elicited mechanical hypersensitivity, but also suppressed the increased BDNF levels in DRG neurons. PSNL shifted BDNF expression in the ipsilateral DRG from small to medium and larger size injured neurons. BDNF is mainly co-expressed with the EP1 and EP4 while moderately with the EP2 and EP3 receptor subtypes in naive and PSNL rats. PSNL also shifted the expression of EP1-4 receptors to a larger size population of DRG neurons. In DRG explant cultures, a stabilized PGE2 analog 16,16 dimethyl PGE2 (dmPGE2) or the agonists of EP1 and EP4 receptors significantly increased BDNF levels and the phosphorylated protein kinase A (PI(A), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)/mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) and cAMP response element binding protein (CREB). The EP1 and EP4 antagonists, a sequester of nerve growth factor (NGF), the inhibitors of PKA and MEK as well as CREB small interfering RNA suppressed dmPGE2-induced BDNF. Taken together, EP1 and EP4 receptor subtypes, PKA, ERK/MAPK and CREB signaling pathways as well as NGF are involved in PGE2-induced BDNF synthesis in DRG neurons. Injured nerve derived-PGE2 contributes to BDNF up-regulation in DRG neurons following nerve injury. Facilitating the synthesis of BDNF in primary sensory neurons is a novel mechanism underlying the role of PGE2 in the genesis of neuropathic pain. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

It is primarily characterized by altered cognitive ability including impaired language and communication skills and fundamental deficits in social reciprocity. Despite some notable successes in neuropsychiatric genetics, overall, the high heritability of ASD (similar to 90%) remains poorly explained by common genetic risk variants. However, recent studies suggest that rare genomic variation, in particular copy number variation, may account for a significant proportion of the genetic basis of ASD. We present a large scale analysis to identify candidate genes which may contain low-frequency recessive variation contributing to ASD while taking into account the potential contribution of population differences to the genetic heterogeneity of ASD. Our strategy, homozygous haplotype (HH) mapping, aims to detect homozygous segments of identical haplotype structure that are shared at a higher frequency amongst ASD patients compared to parental controls. The analysis was performed on 1,402 Autism Genome Project trios genotyped for 1 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). We identified 25 known and 1,218 novel ASD candidate genes in the discovery analysis including CADM2, ABHD14A, CHRFAM7A, GRIK2, GRM3, EPHA3, FGF10, KCND2, PDZK1, IMMP2L and FOXP2. Furthermore, 10 of the previously reported ASD genes and 300 of the novel candidates identified in the discovery analysis were replicated in an independent sample of 1,182 trios. Our results demonstrate that regions of HH are significantly enriched for previously reported ASD candidate genes and the observed association is independent of gene size (odds ratio 2.10). Our findings highlight the applicability of HH mapping in complex disorders such as ASD and offer an alternative approach to the analysis of genome-wide association data.

PREDICT Sunnybrook ICH CTA Study	Prediction of haematoma growth and outcome in patients with intracerebral haemorrhage using the CT-angiography spot sign (PREDICT): a prospective observational study	LANCET NEUROLOGY			English	Article							ACTIVATED FACTOR-VII; CONTRAST EXTRAVASATION; IDENTIFIES PATIENTS; HIGHEST RISK; EXPANSION; MORTALITY; SCORE; VOLUME	Background In patients with intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH), early haemorrhage expansion affects clinical outcome. Haemostatic treatment reduces haematoma expansion, but fails to improve clinical outcomes in many patients. Proper selection of patients at high risk for haematoma expansion seems crucial to improve outcomes. In this study, we aimed to prospectively validate the CT-angiography (CTA) spot sign for prediction of haematoma expansion. Methods PREDICT (predicting haematoma growth and outcome in intracerebral haemorrhage using contrast bolus CT) was a multicentre prospective observational cohort study. We recruited patients aged 18 years or older, with ICH smaller than 100 mL, and presenting at less than 6 h from symptom onset. Using two independent core laboratories, one neuroradiologist determined CTA spot-sign status, whereas another neurologist masked for clinical outcomes and imaging measured haematoma volumes by computerised planimetry. The primary outcome was haematoma expansion defined as absolute growth greater than 6 mL or a relative growth of more than 33% from initial CT to follow-up CT. We reported data using standard descriptive statistics stratified by the CTA spot sign. Mortality was assessed with Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Findings We enrolled 268 patients. Median time from symptom onset to baseline CT was 135 min (range 22-470), and time from onset to CTA was 159 min (32-475). 81 (30%) patients were spot-sign positive. The primary analysis included 228 patients, who had a follow-up CT before surgery or death. Median baseline ICH volume was 19.9 mL (1.5-80.9) in spot-sign-positive patients versus 10.0 mL (0.1-102.7) in spot-sign negative patients (p<0.001). Median ICH expansion was 8.6 mL (-9.3 to 121.7) for spot-sign positive patients and 0.4 mL (-11.7 to 98-3) for spot-negative patients (p<0.001). In those with haematoma expansion, the positive predictive value for the spot sign was 73%; the negative predictive value was 84%, sensitivity was 63%, and specificity was 90%. Median 3-month modified Rankin Scale (mRS) was 5 in CTA spot-sign-positive patients, and 3 in spot-sign-negative patients (p<0.001). Mortality at 3 months was 43.4% (23 of 53) in CTA spot-sign positive versus 19.6% (31 of 158) in CTA spot-sign-negative patients (HR 2.4, 95% CI 1.4-4.0, p=0 002). Interpretation These findings confirm previous single-centre studies showing that the CTA spot sign is a predictor of haematoma expansion. The spot sign is recommended as an entry criterion for future trials of haemostatic therapy in patients with acute ICH.

The plant defensin RsAFP2 induces cell wall stress, septin mislocalization and accumulation of ceramides in Candida albicans	MOLECULAR MICROBIOLOGY			English	Article							ANTIFUNGAL PLANT; NEUROSPORA-CRASSA; FUSARIUM-GRAMINEARUM; RAPHANUS-SATIVUS; USTILAGO-MAYDIS; FUNGAL GROWTH; LIPID-II; YEAST; BIOSYNTHESIS; PROTEINS	The antifungal plant defensin RsAFP2 isolated from radish interacts with fungal glucosylceramides and induces apoptosis in Candida albicans. To further unravel the mechanism of RsAFP2 antifungal action and tolerance mechanisms, we screened a library of 2868 heterozygous C. albicans deletion mutants and identified 30 RsAFP2-hypersensitive mutants. The most prominent group of RsAFP2 tolerance genes was involved in cell wall integrity and hyphal growth/septin ring formation. Consistent with these genetic data, we demonstrated that RsAFP2 interacts with the cell wall of C. albicans, which also contains glucosylceramides, and activates the cell wall integrity pathway. Moreover, we found that RsAFP2 induces mislocalization of septins and blocks the yeast-to-hypha transition in C. albicans. Increased ceramide levels have previously been shown to result in apoptosis and septin mislocalization. Therefore, ceramide levels in C. albicans membranes were analysed following RsAFP2 treatment and, as expected, increased accumulation of phytoC24-ceramides in membranes of RsAFP2-treated C. albicans cells was detected. This is the first report on the interaction of a plant defensin with glucosylceramides in the fungal cell wall, causing cell wall stress, and on the effects of a defensin on septin localization and ceramide accumulation.

However, ascribing imaging measures to underlying cellular and molecular events is challenging. Here we review human neuroimaging findings of structural plasticity and then discuss cellular and molecular level changes that could underlie observed imaging effects. Greater dialog between researchers in these different fields would help to facilitate cross-talk between cellular and systems level explanations of how learning sculpts brain structure.
