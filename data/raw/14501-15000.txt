J	Chertkow, H; Black, S				Chertkow, Howard; Black, Sandra			Imaging biomarkers and their role in dementia clinical trials	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF NEUROLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	2nd Canadian Conference on Antidementia Drug Guidelines	OCT 28-29, 2004	Montreal, CANADA				MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; EARLY ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; CEREBRAL BLOOD-FLOW; ISCHEMIC VASCULAR-DISEASE; TEMPORAL-LOBE ATROPHY; HIPPOCAMPAL ATROPHY; GLUCOSE-METABOLISM; BRAIN METABOLISM; EPSILON-4 ALLELE	There are five potential major roles for neuroimaging with respect to dementia; 1) as a cognitive neuroscience research tool, 2) for prediction of which normal or slightly impaired individuals will develop dementia and over what time frame, 3) for early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in demented individuals, (sensitivity) and separation of AD from other forms of dementia (specificity), 4) for monitoring of disease progression, and 5) for monitoring response to therapies. Focusing on the last role, no single imaging approach is yet ideal, as all trade-off speed, cost, and accuracy. Functional imaging (SPECT and PET) is best suited to tracking symptomatic therapy response, and anatomic (MRI volumetric) imaging or amyloid PET are more suited to reflect dementia modulation studies. The potential for imaging with respect to pharmacological studies of dementia - to provide surrogate markers for drug studies, to improve diagnosis, to speed evaluation of outcomes, and to decrease sample sizes is huge. At the present time, however, no single measure has sufficient proven reliability, replicability, or robustness, to replace clinical primary outcome measures.

Altered gene expression in cells from patients with lysosomal storage disorders suggests impairment of the ubiquitin pathway	CELL DEATH AND DIFFERENTIATION			English	Article						apoptosis; lysosomal storage disorders; proteosome; RNA arrays; Sandhoff disease; ubiquitin C; terminal hydrolase	CARBOXYL-TERMINAL HYDROLASE; HUMAN TAY-SACHS; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; SANDHOFF-DISEASES; MOUSE MODELS; GAD MICE; APOPTOSIS; NEURODEGENERATION; FIBROBLASTS; UCH-L1	By comparing mRNA profiles in cultured fibroblasts from patients affected with lysosomal storage diseases, we identified differentially expressed genes common to these conditions. These studies, confirmed by biochemical experiments, demonstrated that lysosomal storage is associated with downregulation of ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase, UCH-L1 in the cells of eight different lysosomal disorders, as well as in the brain of a mouse model of Sandhoff disease. Induction of lysosomal storage by the cysteine protease inhibitor E-64 also reduced UCH-L1 mRNA, protein level and activity. All cells exhibiting lysosomal storage contained ubiquitinated protein aggregates and showed reduced levels of free ubiquitin and decreased proteasome activity. The caspase- mediated apoptosis in E-64-treated fibroblasts was reversed by transfection with a UCH-L1 plasmid, and increased after downregulation of UCH-L1 by siRNA, suggesting that UCH-L1 deficiency and impairment of the ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation pathway can contribute to the increased cell death observed in many lysosomal storage disorders.

Inspiratory muscle unloading by neurally adjusted ventilatory assist during maximal inspiratory efforts in healthy subjects	CHEST			English	Article						control of breathing; diaphragm electrical activity; inspiratory capacity; mechanical ventilation; patient ventilator interaction; respiratory muscle unloading	DIAPHRAGM EMG; ACTIVATION; VOLUMES; DISEASE; INJURY	Background: Neurally adjusted ventilator), assist (NAVA) is a mode of mechanical ventilation in which the ventilator is controlled by the electrical activity of the diaphragm (EAdi). During maximal inspirations, the pressure delivered can theoretically reach extreme levels that may cause harm to the lungs. The aims of this study were to evaluate whether NAVA could efficiently unload the respiratory muscles during maximal inspiratory efforts, and if a high level of NAVA would suppress EAdi without increasing lung-distending pressures. Method: In awake healthy subjects (n = 9), NAVA was applied at increasing levels in a stepwise fashion during quiet breathing and maximal inspirations. EAdi and airway pressure (Paw), esophageal pressure (Pes), and gastric pressure, flow, and volume were measured. Results: During maximal inspirations with a high NAVA level, peak Paw was 37.1 +/- 11.0 cm H2O (mean +/- SD). This reduced Pes deflections from - 14.2 +/- 2.7 to 2.3 +/- 2.3 cm H2O (P < 0.001) and EAdi to 43 +/- 7% (p < 0.001), compared to maximal inspirations with no assist. At high NAVA levels, inspiratory capacity showed a modest increase of 11 +/- 11% (p = 0.024). Conclusion: In healthy subjects, NAVA can safely and efficiently unload the respiratory muscles during maximal inspiratory maneuvers, without failing to cycle-off ventilatory assist and without causing excessive lung distention. Despite maximal unloading of the diaphragm at high levels of NAVA, EAdi is still present and able to control the ventilator.

The neural representation of odor is modulated by the presence of a trigeminal stimulus during odor encoding	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						olfaction; trigeminal; context; EEG; evoked potentials	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; HUMAN OLFACTORY CORTEX; EMOTIONAL RESPONSES; INDUCED ACTIVATION; NASAL-MUCOSA; HUMANS; MIXTURES; STIMULATION; BRAIN; PERCEPTION	Objectives: Odor perception does not simply consist in hierarchical processing from transduction to a single "true" cerebral representation. Odor sensation may be modulated by available sensory information during encoding. The present study set out to examine whether the presence of a pure trigeminal stimulus during odor encoding may modulate odor perception at both behavioral and cortical levels. Methods: Participants were tested in a 2-session within-subject design: first, an odor encoding session included a delay conditioning procedure in which relatively selective olfactory stimulants (phenyl ethyl alcohol or vanillin, Conditioned Stimulus+, CS+) were presented either with a pulse Of CO2 (Unconditioned Stimulus, US), or alone (Conditioned Stimulus-, CS-); then, in the second session, both pure odorants (CS+ and CS-) were presented alone. During this second session, olfactory event-related potentials were simultaneously recorded and analyzed at different electrode sites including Cz and Pz (sites known to have maximal amplitudes for trigeminal and olfactory stimuli, respectively). After each trial, subjects were asked to rate odor intensity and hedonics. Results: The results showed that CS+ intensity ratings increased in 8 subjects and decreased in 6. Cortically, a group effect was observed for P2 amplitude, which increased in the "CS+ intensity increase" group vs. the "CS+ intensity decrease" group at Cz (p < 0.05) but not at Pz (p > 0.05). Conclusions: This result suggests that the presence of a pure trigeminal Stimulus (CO2) during odor encoding alters the neural representation of a pure odor. Significance: The neural representation of odors comprises not only the odor itself but also contextual information (trigeminal in the present case) presented during encoding.

J	Muller, HFJ				Muller, Herbert F. J.			Epistemology Returns to Its Roots	CONSTRUCTIVIST FOUNDATIONS			English	Article						Subject-inclusiveness; cybernetics; back-up function		Purpose: Understanding the place of Ernst von Glasersfeld's Radical Constructivism (RC), and some of its implications, in the development of epistemology. Design: Characterization of two main options for the content of "knowledge" (without and with belief in mind-independent structures), sketch of their history in occidental thought; comparison of their properties concerning subjectivity, objectivity, second-order cybernetics, reliability of mental tools, and the needs and mechanisms for certainty and overall structures. Results: Awareness that we structure mental working tools can, as RC suggests, replace belief in mind-independent reality, and this change dissolves the conceptual problem of metaphysics-ontology, but also eliminates the certainty expected from it, which raises the possibility of relativism. Working-concepts cannot be deconstructed because they imply no ontological claims. Subject(s) are necessarily included in all knowledge ( which does not mean solipsism): because subjective experience encompasses all mental tools, including those of objectivity and mathematics, while in contrast the subject itself cannot become an objective system. Practical reliability of mental tools differs from subjective certainty, which requires an ontological leap of faith to positive beliefs: for specific tools including automata, and for positive holistic structures. However, in agreement with the constructivist view, holistic views can instead have an unstructured center, with reliability = viability, which prevents relativism. In sum, belief in mid-independent reality is needed for certainty if desired; for all other purposes constructivism is more helpful. Implications: The change in view suggested by von Glasersfeld's work is of relevance for a number of fields of study with conceptual problems ( such as the mind-brain relation). However, due to their generality, the implications will need evaluation in specific instances. The question of certainty needs attention for practical reasons.

Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors, such as rivastigmine, have been shown to improve cognition in other disorders, particularly Alzheimer's disease. Dysfunctions in cholinergic systems, especially in the prefrontal cortex, have been identified in SZ, suggesting that cholinesterase inhibitors may be effective in treating cognitive deficits in this disease. Research design and methods: Using a randomized crossover design, we assessed SZ patients with stable symptoms and poor cognitive functioning. Fifty-eight patients with memory deficits, according to subjective complaints or based on clinicians' observations, were assessed with the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) and Subjective Scale to Investigate Cognition in Schizophrenia (SSTICS). Only 24 of these subjects met the inclusion criteria. Twenty patients took part in the study (four dropped out). All subjects meeting the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition (DSM-IV) criteria for SZ were maintained on their current antipsychotic medication (18 atypicals and two typicals) and were randomly assigned to treatment with rivastigmine. Dosage was a function of tolerability, beginning at 3 mg/day and progressively increasing to 9 mg/day. Subjects were given the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) at baseline and 3 and 6 months. Results: The results revealed no significant improvement in any of the cognitive variables investigated following rivastigmine treatment and symptom severity scores remained unchanged over all recorded time periods. Conclusion: Rivastigmine treatment did not appear to enhance cognition in SZ patients with important cognitive impairments. This finding needs to be interpreted with care and requires substantiation with larger sample size studies with patients treated with cognitive enhancer for longer periods.

Seizure outcome after resection of supratentorial cavernous malformations: A study of 168 patients	EPILEPSIA			English	Article						cavernous malformation; epilepsy; outcome; resection	EPILEPTIC SEIZURES; NATURAL-HISTORY; ANGIOMAS; HEMANGIOMAS; MANAGEMENT; SERIES	Purpose: The optimal management of cerebral cavernous malformations (CCMs) with epileptic seizures is still a matter of debate. The aim of our study was to examine seizure outcome in the largest published series of surgically treated patients with epilepsy due to a supratentorial CCM, and to define predictors for good surgical outcome. Methods: We retrospectively studied 168 consecutive patients with a single supratentorial CCM and symptomatic epilepsy in a multicenter study. Pre- and postoperative clinical examinations, age at epilepsy onset, age at operation, type of symptoms due to the CCM (seizures, headache, hemorrhage, focal deficits), type and frequency of epileptic seizures, and the localization and size of the CCM were assessed. Seizure outcome was determined in the first, second, and third postoperative years. Results: The CCM was completely resected in all patients. More than two thirds of the patients were classified as seizure free in the first 3 postoperative years. Predictors for good seizure outcome were age older than 30 years at the time of surgery, mesiotemporal CCM localization, CCM size < 1.5 cm, and the absence of secondarily generalized seizures. No mortality occurred in our series, but only mild postoperative neurologic deficits in 12 (7%) patients. Conclusions: Considering the natural history of CCMs, the favorable neurologic and seizure outcome, surgical resection of CCMs should be considered in all patients with supratentorial CCMs and concomitant epilepsy, irrespective of the presence or absence of predictors for a favorable seizure outcome.

Valproate, clonazepam and/or phenytoin are said to be the most effective antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) against the seizures in AS. Experience with the newer AEDs is very limited despite their better safety profile and tolerability. Considering its favorable side effect profile and its effectiveness against both partial and generalized seizures, we hypothesized that lamotrigine (LTG) might be more efficacious and better tolerated. Methods: Potential patients for this retrospective study were identified from the epilepsy clinics at Notre-Dame, Sainte-Justine, and Yale New Haven hospitals. Patients were included in the study if they had AS along with refractory seizures. The medical record of each patient was reviewed with interest on seizure types, previous AEDs and response to LTG. Results: Five patients (2M, 3F) were included in this study. Age at LTG ranged from 10 to 33 years old. All had >= 2 seizure types, mainly generalized tonic-clonic, myoclonic seizures, and atypical absences. Previously tried AEDs included valproic acid (5), benzodiazepines (5), phenytoin (4), carbamazepine (3), and topiramate (1). One patient had pancreatitis on phenytoin, one had worsened seizures on carbamazepine, and one developed hepatic encephalopathy on valproic acid. Three patients became seizure-free with LTG (9, 20, and 36 months FU), one was seizure-free for 1 year with subsequent loss of efficacy, and one showed > 50% reduction in myoclonic seizures (20 months FU). No side effects were reported. Conclusion: LTG can be efficacious and well tolerated in patients with AS.

The first and third patients presented with convulsive status epilepticus and the second with non-convulsive status after penicillin administration. in all cerebrospinal fluid and the serum Venereal Disease Research Laboratory Test (VDRL) and Treponema Pallidum hemagglutination (TPHA) or fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption test (FTA-ABS) were positive, but HIV serology was negative. Their EEGs showed periodic, lateralized, epileptiform discharges (PLEDs) just after SE. The first and third patients had no history of epilepsy. Seizures started as focal motor attacks but then secondarily generalized. The first patient's cranial MRI showed cerebral atrophy and hyperintensity involving bilateral medial and anterior temporal regions, more prominent on the left and which disappeared after penicillin treatment. The second case, after receiving penicillin, had nonconvulsive SE, a clinical presentation suggesting a Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction (JHR). Her cranial MR revealed moderate cortical atrophy and widespread confluent hyperintense foci mainly in both periventricular areas, corona radiata and centrum semiovale.

J	Todd, KJ; Auld, DS; Robitaille, R				Todd, Keith J.; Auld, Daniel S.; Robitaille, Richard			Neurotrophins modulate neuron-glia interactions at a vertebrate synapse	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						BDNF; NT-3; Schwann cell; synapse-glia interactions; synaptic transmission	DEVELOPING NEUROMUSCULAR SYNAPSES; GROWTH-FACTOR SYNTHESIS; TERMINAL SCHWANN-CELLS; TRANSMITTER RELEASE; SCIATIC-NERVE; DIFFERENTIAL RESPONSE; SIGNAL-TRANSDUCTION; TRKB RECEPTORS; MUSCLE-FIBERS; RAT TRKC	Neurotrophins are important modulators of synaptic function at both developing and mature synapses in the CNS and PNS. At the neuromuscular junction (NMJ), neurotrophins, as well as perisynaptic Schwann cells (PSCs) are critical for the long-term maintenance and stability of the synapse. Considering this correlation and the acute interactions that occur at the synapse between PSCs and the nerve terminal, we wondered if neurotrophins could also be involved in neuron-glia signalling. To test if neurotrophins were able to signal to PSCs we used brief applications of neurotrophin-3 (NT-3), brain-derived neurotophic factor (BDNF) or nerve growth factor (NGF; 100 ng/mL). Soleus muscles of mice were incubated with the Ca2+ indicator Fluo-4AM and Ca2+ responses in PSCs were elicited through nerve stimulation (50 Hz, 30 s). Our results indicate that acute application of both NT-3 and BDNF, but not NGF, increased PSC Ca2+ responses. Investigation of the mechanisms involved in these increases revealed distinct pathways for BDNF and NT-3. BDNF increased PSC responsiveness through potentiation of ATP responses while NT-3 modulated muscarinic acetylcholine receptor signalling. Using local applications of the neurotrophins, we found that both neurotrophins were able to elicit Ca2+ responses in PSCs where BDNF used a phospholipase C-inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (PLC-IP3) mechanism, while NT-3 required extracellular Ca2+. Our results demonstrate a neurotrophin-dependent modulation of neuron-glia signalling through differential mechanisms employed by NT-3 and BDNF. Hence, neurotrophins precisely and differentially regulate PSC functions through modulation of either purinergic or cholinergic signalling pathways.

We aimed to evaluate prognostic factors for relapse after ADEM in children. A total of 132 children from the French National KIDSEP Neuropediatric Cohort (mean age at onset: 6 +/- 3.3 years; mean follow-up: 5.4 +/- 3.3 years; lost to follow-up: 10%). ADEM diagnosis was considered in a previously healthy patient acutely presenting more than one neurological deficit, change in mental state and MRI alterations including white matter changes. We used multivariate survival analysis (Cox model) evaluating the prognostic value of baseline clinical, biological and MRI covariates, for the occurrence of a second attack. Twenty-four (18%) of included patients had a second attack. An increased risk of relapse was associated with optic neuritis (hazard ratio, 5.23; 95% CI, 2-13.65), familial history of central nervous system inflammatory demyelination (7.79; 1.54-39.5), Barkhof multiple sclerosis (MS) criteria on MRI (2.52; 1.04-6.12) and no neurological sequelae after first attack (3.79; 1.12-12.85). Clinical and MRI prognostic factors for relapse in ADEM may contribute to an early distinction between monophasic and relapsing disease, which may be related to MS.

A clear approach concerning the usage of CANTAB for the appraisal of neurocognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia is currently lacking. Method. - In this paper, we have first reviewed the overall applications of CANTAB and then evaluated methodological strengths and weaknesses of CANTAB as a neurocognitive battery for schizophrenia. We carried out a systematic search and assessment of studies where CANTAB was utilized to measure cognitive function in schizophrenia. We have also attempted to quantify the available data and perform a meta-analysis, but this approach turned out to be still premature. Results. - CANTAB has enabled researchers to highlight significant deficits affecting broad cognitive domains in schizophrenia, such as working memory, decision-making, attention, executive functions and visual memory. So far, the most consistent deficit observed with CANTAB testing has been attentional set-shifting, suggestive of fronto-striatal dysfunctions. In addition, preliminary evidence points towards the potential use of CANTAB to identify cognitive predictors of psychosocial functioning, to describe the relationships between symptoms and cognition, and to measure the impact of pharmacological agents on cognitive functioning. Conclusion. - CANTAB has been used successfully to highlight the range of visuo-spatial cognitive deficits in schizophrenia, producing similar results to those obtained with some traditional neuropsychological tests. Further studies validating the use of CANTAB following the standard set by Measurement And Treatment Research to Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia (MATRICS) are warranted.

Existing treatments have limited effectiveness and produce relatively frequent adverse effects. Preclinical research has identified many promising pharmacological targets; however, reliable predictors of success in humans remain elusive. At least 50 new molecular entities have reached clinical development including: glutamate antagonists, cytokine inhibitors, vanilloid-receptor agonists, catecholamine modulators, ion-channel blockers, anticonvulsants, opioids, cannabinoids, COX inhibitors, acteylcholine modulators, adenosine receptor agonists and several miscellaneous drugs. Eight drugs are in Phase III trials at present. Strategies that may show promise over existing treatments include topical therapies, analgesic combinations and, in future, gene-related therapies. Recent years have heralded an explosion of pharmaceutical development in neuropathic pain, reflecting advanced knowledge of neurobiology and a heightened perception of the commercial value of neuropathic pain therapeutics. In the interest of improving patient care, the authors recommend implementing comparative studies throughout the development process in order to demonstrate the increased value of novel agents.

RICH consists of a highly acidic N-terminal domain, a catalytic domain with 2',3'-cyclic nucleotide 3'-phosphodiesterase (CNPase) activity and a C-terminal isoprenylation site. In vitro RICH and mammalian brain CNPase specifically catalyze the hydrolysis of 2',3'-cyclic nucleotides to produce 2'-nucleotides, but the physiologically relevant in vivo substrate remains unknown. Here, we report the NMR structure of the catalytic domain of goldfish RICH and describe its binding to CNPase inhibitors. The structure consists of a twisted nine-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet surrounded by alpha-helices on both sides. Despite significant local differences mostly arising from a seven-residue insert in the RICH sequence, the active site region is highly similar to that of human CNPase. Likewise, refinement of the catalytic domain of rat CNPase using residual dipolar couplings gave improved agreement with the published crystal structure. NMR titrations of RICH with inhibitors point to a similar catalytic mechanism for RICH and CNPase. The results suggest a functional importance for the evolutionarily conserved phosphodiesterase activity and hint of a link with pre-tRNA splicing.

Salivary cortisol samples were collected across 1 waking day in 36 pre-school children whose mothers are participants in an ongoing longitudinal project. Hierarchical Linear Modeling (HLM) identified statistically significant predictors of individual differences in daily cortisol trajectories. Children displayed relatively low post-awakening values and flatter cortisol trajectories across the day as a function of unsupportive maternal behaviour, second-hand smoke and maternal histories of social withdrawal in childhood. These results suggest that individual differences in young children's pattern of diurnal cortisol are associated with a variety of current and historical maternal characteristics and behaviours. The identification of intergenerational predictors of children's diurnal neuroendocrine functioning may provide new insights into the transfer of health and developmental risk from parent to child.

A methodology is proposed to build population-based average three dimensional (3-D) atlases or standards of the human cornea based on topographic data, along with variation maps. Also, methodologies for comparing populations or screening populations, based on these atlases are proposed. METHODS. Topographies (Orbscan II; Bausch & Lomb, Rochester, NY) of 516 normal subjects were used. Methodology for the construction of a corneal atlas consisted of (1) data acquisition from both anterior and posterior corneal surfaces in the format of a 10 1 X 10 1 grid of z elevations evenly spaced (every 0.1 mm) along the x and y axes; (2) spatial normalization of the topographies on a unique average best-fit sphere to reduce the large variability in size and spatial location between corneas; (3) generation of the average 3-D model; and (4) statistics maps including average, median, and SD for each point of the grid. RESULTS. To demonstrate the informative potential of this methodology, examples of atlases were generated. Numerical corneal atlases allow (1) characterization of a population, (2) comparison of two or more populations, (3) comparison of an individual with a reference population, and (4) screening of a population for the detection of specific corneal shape abnormalities, such as keratoconus or previous refractive surgery. CONCLUSIONS. The concept of a 3-D corneal atlas was developed. The proposed technique was meant to be simple, accurate, reliable, and robust and can be extended easily to any type of topographer capable of providing tridimensional corneal maps.

Methods and Results: Eighty patients with HF ages 62.5 +/- 8.4 years presenting mostly with New York Heart Association class II symptoms (class II 57.5%, III 41.3%), and mean left ventricular ejection fraction 27.1 +/- 7.3% were recruited. The patients were randomized to receive candesartan titrated to 32 mg 1 per day versus placebo in double-blind fashion for 6 months. Nt-proBNP, markers of inflammation and oxidative stress, glucose, insulin, and fasting insulin resistance index were analyzed. Candesartan decreased Nt-proBNP (median value = 12.4% versus -20.4%; [candesartan] P = .05), and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) (+5.32% versus -20.3% [candesartan]; P = 0.046), without significantly influencing serum interleukin-6, interleukin-18, adhesion molecules, or markers of oxidative stress. Blood glucose decreased in patients treated with candesartan with a significantly greater effect in patients with higher blood glucose levels (P < .01 for interaction). Conclusions: The addition of candesartan to ACE inhibitor and beta-blocker decreases Nt-proBNP and hsCRP, but does not change the other markers of inflammation or oxidative stress in patients with heart failure. Dual angiotensm-II suppression also decreased blood glucose with a greater impact in patients with higher blood glucose level.

Children who have been exposed to abuse or neglect are more likely to develop numerous psychopathologies, while good parent-infant bonding is associated with improved resiliency to stress. Similar observations have also been reported in non-human primates and rodents, suggesting that at least some neurodevelopmental aspects of parent-offspring interactions are conserved among mammals and could therefore be studied in animals. We present data to suggest that frequency of licking and grooming provided by the dam during a critical period in development plays an important role in modifying neurodevelopment. These findings are examined in the broader context in which exposure to other sensory modalities such as vision or hearing during a specific period in development shapes brain development with functional consequences that persist into adulthood. We also discuss recent rodent work showing that increased frequency of licking and grooming provided by the dam during the first week of life is associated with changes in DNA methylation of promoter elements that control expression of these genes and behavior. The stability of DNA methylation in postmitotic cells provides a possible molecular scaffold by which changes in gene expression and behavioral traits induced by postnatal maternal care are maintained throughout life. Finally, the relevance of findings reported in rodents to those noted in non-human primates and humans are assessed and the research and clinical implications of these observations for future work are explored.

Biochemical and bioimaging markers for risk assessment and diagnosis in major cardiovascular diseases: a road to integration of complementary diagnostic tools	JOURNAL OF INTERNAL MEDICINE			English	Review						acute coronary syndrome; biochemical markers; bioimaging cardiovascular disease; congestive heart failure; stroke	C-REACTIVE PROTEIN; CORONARY-HEART-DISEASE; ACUTE ISCHEMIC-STROKE; MIDDLE-AGED MEN; IMPLANTABLE CARDIOVERTER-DEFIBRILLATOR; DENSITY-LIPOPROTEIN CHOLESTEROL; TISSUE-PLASMINOGEN ACTIVATOR; LEFT-VENTRICULAR DYSFUNCTION; ACUTE MYOCARDIAL-INFARCTION; BRAIN NATRIURETIC PEPTIDE	This report from the first International Course on Integrated Biomarkers, Biochemical and Bioimaging Endpoints in Cardiovascular Diagnosis, Prevention, Therapy and Drug Development provides the basis for optimizing diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic information in four areas of cardiovascular medicine: primary prevention of cardiovascular diseases, acute coronary syndromes, heart failure and stroke. Risk stratification and treatment strategies can be refined and enhanced through integration of bioimaging and biochemical markers to characterize sub-clinical and clinical atherosclerosis. For the integrative approach to be useful, each of the biomarkers must be validated and cost-effective. Clinical decision is the primary level of integration and is based on clinical evaluation and the use of a combination of bioimaging and biochemical markers. The decision to initiate preventive or therapeutic intervention must take into account the factors affecting the levels of expression of the biomarker and the potential input the biomarker has on metabolic processes or modulation of other biomarkers. The optimal approach to intervention must take into consideration the risk-benefit and cost-effectiveness ratios.

However, its overexpression has also been associated with the multidrug resistance phenotype in tumors. Here, we have investigated the regulation of P-gp transport activity by sphingosine kinase 1 (SphK-1) in brain endothelial cells. We first demonstrated that SphK-1 is overexpressed in endothelial cells (EC) isolated from rat brain tumors compared with EC from normal brain. We also provide evidence that the overexpression of SphK-1 in the cerebral EC line RBE4 leads to the up-regulation of P-gp, both at the gene and protein levels, and that this modulation depends on the catalytic activity of SphK-1. Moreover, we determined the effect of sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), the product of SphK-1, on P-gp function. S1P strongly stimulates P-gp transport activity, without modulating its expression. Finally, we found that the S1P-mediated stimulation of P-gp activity is mediated by S1P-1 and S1P-3 receptors at the RBE4 cell surface. Altogether, these results indicate that SphK-1 and its product S1P are involved in the control of P-gp activity in RBE4 cells. Since SphK-1 is overexpressed in EC from brain tumors, these data also suggest that this kinase and its product could contribute to the acquisition and the maintenance of the multidrug resistance phenotype in brain tumor-derived endothelial cells.

A comparison of the glutamate release inhibition and anti-allodynic effects of gabapentin, lamotrigine, and riluzole in a model of neuropathic pain	JOURNAL OF NEUROCHEMISTRY			English	Article						allodynia; CCI; gabapentin; glutamate; neuropathy; nociception; pain	RAT SPINAL-CORD; NERVE-TERMINALS SYNAPTOSOMES; NA+ CHANNEL BLOCKERS; FORMALIN TEST; ANTIEPILEPTIC DRUGS; CALCIUM-CHANNEL; EVOKED RELEASE; GRANULE CELLS; DORSAL-HORN; NOCICEPTION	The effects of treatment with the anti-convulsant agents, lamotrigine and riluzole were compared with gabapentin in a rat experimental model of neuropathic pain. Rats were treated intraperitoneally, with gabapentin (30, 100 and 300 mg/kg), lamotrigine (2, 10 and 50 mg/kg) or riluzole (6 and 12 mg/kg) prior to, and every 12 h for 4 days following chronic constriction injury (CCI) of the sciatic nerve. Mechanical and cold sensitivity were assessed prior to surgery (baseline) and then at 4, 8 and 12 days following CCI. The four-day treatment with each of the agents was effective at producing reductions in the development of mechanical and cold hypersensitivity for periods ranging from the fourth to 12th day. The highest doses of each of the agents were also assessed on formalin-induced nociceptive behaviors and on formalin-induced increases in extracellular glutamate (Glu) and aspartate (Asp) in the spinal cord dorsal horn (SCDH) of awake behaving rats using in vivo microdialysis. Nociceptive scores in formalin test were significantly decreased by gabapentin (300 mg/kg i.p.) and riluzole (12 mg/kg i.p.), but not by lamotrigine (50 mg/kg i.p.). Formalin-induced increases in glutamate levels in SCDH were lowered significantly, as compared with the controls, with all drugs both in the first phase and second phases, with the greatest effects for riluzole and gabapentin. Similar suppressive effects of the drugs were observed on formalin-induced increases in spinal aspartate, except that gabapentin and lamotrigine produced effects only during the second phase. Riluzole produced profound and prolonged reductions in the spinal levels of glutamate and aspartate both for basal and formalin-stimulated release. In conclusion, the results suggest that the anti-convulsant agents gabapentin, lamotrigine and riluzole may reduce the development of hyperalgesia in a rat model of neuropathic pain by reducing the spinal release of glutamate. Riluzole's pronounced suppressive effects on spinal EAA levels is attributed to its established role as a glutamate release inhibitor and an enhancer of glutamate transporter activity.

Most of the antibodies used to identify oligodendrocytes label the myelin sheath as well. Originally described as an inhibitor of axonal outgrowth, Nogo-A is known to be strongly expressed in mature oligodendrocytes in vivo. In the present investigation we analyzed the expression patterns of Nogo-A in adult mouse and human CNS as well as in demyelinating animal models and multiple sclerosis lesions. Nogo-A expression was compared with that of other frequently used oligodendroglial markers such as CC1, CNP, and in situ hybridization for proteolipid protein mRNA. Nogo-A strongly and reliably labeled oligodendrocytes in the adult CNS as well as in demyelinating lesions and thus represents a valuable tool for the identification of oligodendrocytes in human and mouse CNS tissue.

This preattentional process has been studied extensively, yet its cerebral origins have not been determined with sufficient accuracy to allow comparison to established anatomical and functional parcellations. Here we used event-related functional MRI and EEG in a parametric experimental design to determine the cortical areas in individual brains that participate in the detection of acoustic changes. Our results suggest that automatic change processing consists of at least three stages: initial detection in the primary auditory cortex, detailed analysis in the posterior superior temporal gyrus and planum temporale, and judgment of sufficient novelty for the allocation of attentional resources in the mid-ventrolateral prefrontal cortex.

Testing the propriospinal hypothesis. J Neurophysiol 97: 2570-2574, 2007. First published January 10, 2007; doi:10.1152/jn. 00814.2006. Many laboratories have reported the successful regeneration of neurons across damaged portions of the spinal cord. Associated improvements in hindlimb locomotor movements have been attributed to the formation of functional neuronal connections with the locomotor central pattern generator (CPG). However, regenerating axons generally extend no more than 10 mm caudal to the lesion sites, terminating about 20 mm short of the lumbar segments thought to contain the CPG. It has therefore tacitly been assumed that the locomotor improvements arose from activation of propriospinal neurons relaying excitation to the CPG. Here we report a test of this assumption, which we call the propriospinal hypothesis. Intraspinal microstimulation (ISMS) was used to activate the putative propriospinal relay neurons. Approximately 2-3 wk after complete spinal cord transection at T8-T9 in rats, an array of six Pt-Ir microwires was chronically implanted in the intermediate and ventral gray matter of T10-T12 segments. ISMS pulse trains with amplitudes of 0.8-0.9 times threshold for activating axial muscles were delivered during open-field locomotor tests (BBB). ISMS significantly increased BBB scores over control tests, but did not produce limb coordination and weight bearing sufficient for locomotion. These results support the main assumption of the propriospinal hypothesis: that neuronal activity elicited in thoracic spinal segments caudal to a complete spinal cord transection may propagate caudally and activate the locomotor CPG.

Critical evaluation of the colocalization between calcitonin gene-related peptide, substance P, transient receptor potential vanilloid subfamily type 1 immunoreactivities, and isolectin B-4 binding in primary afferent neurons of the rat and mouse	JOURNAL OF PAIN			English	Article						calcitonin gene-related peptide; transient receptor potential vanilloid subfamily type 1; dorsal root ganglia; trigeminal ganglia; isolectin B-4; nociceptor; immunohistochemistry	DORSAL-ROOT GANGLION; PRIMARY SENSORY NEURONS; TRIGEMINAL GANGLION; CONDUCTION-VELOCITY; CAPSAICIN RECEPTOR; ADULT-RAT; IMMUNOCYTOCHEMICAL LOCALIZATION; NEUROPATHIC PAIN; MICE LACKING; DRG NEURONS	Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and/or substance P (SP) immunoreactivity as well as isolectin B-4 (IB4) binding are commonly used to define peptidergic and non-peptidergic nociceptor populations, respectively. Although this demarcation is well supported in the mouse, there is accumulating evidence to suggest it is not so in the rat. Hence, this investigation was undertaken to evaluate and quantify the colocalization of the neuropeptides CGRP and SP with IB4 binding sites and the transient receptor potential vanilloid subfamily type 1 (TRPV1) channel and to compare this colocalization between trigeminal (TG) and dorsal root ganglia (DRG) in adult rats. These findings illustrate that there is a substantial overlap (similar to 45% in the DRG and similar to 30% in the TG) between peptidergic neurons (ie, CGRP- and SP-expressing) and neurons that bind IB4 in rat sensory ganglia. However, there were also significant differences in the colocalization of these markers between the DRG and TG. For instance, in the DRG, significantly more CGRP-immunoreactive neurons also expressed IB4 binding sites (44.5%) compared with the TG (27.5%). In contrast, significantly fewer CGRP-immunoreactive neurons in the DRG colocalized TRPV1 immunoreactivity (49.2%) compared with the TG (70%). Moreover, we directly assessed the colocalization of CGRP and IB4 in the TG of rats and mice using a CGRP antibody that recognizes this peptide in both species. Thus, whereas only an approximately 10% overlap was observed in TG neurons of mouse, significantly greater overlap (similar to 35%) was observed in those of rat. Perspective: These data indicate that in adult rat sensory ganglia, there is not a clear distinction between the peptidergic and non-peptidergic nociceptor subclasses as a function of IB4 binding. Furthermore, there are significant differences between the TG and DRG in the degree to which commonly utilized nociceptive neuronal markers are co-expressed Taken together, the present findings dictate prudence when extrapolating experimental conclusions about the neurochemical classification of neurons between sensory ganglia or between species, including humans.

In the present study, we tested whether decreasing dopamine synthesis, as produced by acute phenylalanine/ tyrosine depletion (APTD), would alter responses to the stimulant drug, d-amphetamine. Methods: On 3 separate days, 14 healthy men received d-amphetamine (0.3 mg/kg, given orally) plus a nutritionally balanced amino acid mixture, the phenylalanine/ tyrosine-deficient mixture or the phenylalanine/ tyrosine-deficient mixture followed by the immediate dopamine precursor, L-DOPA (Sinemet, 2 x 100 mg/25 mg). Responses to these treatments were assessed with visual analog scales, the Profile of Mood States, and a computerized Go/No-Go task. Results: d-Amphetamine elicited its prototypical subjective effects, but these were not altered by APTD. In comparison, APTD significantly increased commission errors on the Go/No-Go task and did so uniquely in conditions where subjects were rewarded for making correct responses; this effect of APTD was prevented by L-DOPA. Conclusions: Together these results support the hypothesis that, in healthy men, dopamine is not closely linked to euphorogenic effects of abused substances but does affect the salience of reward-related cues and the ability to respond to them preferentially.

Four rats received multiple consecutive sessions with both low and high levels of brain stimulation reward (BSR). Rats paused longer and had later start times during sessions when their responses were reinforced with low-magnitude BSR. When estimated by a symmetric Gaussian function, peak times also were earlier; when estimated by a better-fitting asymmetric Gaussian function or by analyzing individual trials, however, these peak-time changes were determined to reflect a mixture of large effects of BSR on start times and no effect on stop times. These results pose a significant dilemma for three major theories of timing (SET, MTS, and BeT), which all predict no effects for chronic manipulations of reinforcer magnitude. We conclude that increased reinforcer magnitude, influences timing in two ways: through larger immediate after-effects that delay responding and through anticipatory effects that elicit earlier responding.

Materials and Methods: Adults with nonneurogenic overactive bladder resistant to behavioral treatments, pelvic floor exercises, medication and neuromodulation were included in the study. The initial evaluation (history, physical examination, 3-day urinary diary, V8 score, flowmetry and post-void residual) was repeated 6 weeks after botulinum toxin A injection. Videourodynamic study was performed 1 hour before injection and 6 weeks later. Botulinum toxin A (200 units) was injected into the detrusor in 10 sites over the bladder base including the trigone. The primary outcome was the presence or absence of vesicoureteral reflux before and 6 weeks after botulinum toxin A injection. The secondary outcomes were clinical and urodynamic parameter changes. Values were compared using the Wilcoxon test. Results: A total of 12 women were enrolled in the study (median age 76 years). The duration of symptoms was 7.5 years. One patient was excluded from analysis because of a urinary tract infection. There were 10 women with no vesicoureteral reflux at baseline and 1 had bilateral vesicoureteral reflux (grade 2 right, grade 1 left). At 6 weeks there was no induced vesicoureteral reflux and the patient with vesicoureteral reflux at baseline showed no change in vesicoureteral reflux grade. No local or systemic side effects related to botulinum toxin A were reported. In terms of efficacy, at direct questioning 6 weeks after treatment 4 of 11 patients reported an improvement that made them ask for another injection. Conclusions: Botulinum toxin A injection into the trigone does not induce de novo vesicoureteral reflux in patients with nonneurogenic overactive bladder. The therapeutic value of this approach remains to be confirmed and compared to other injection designs.

Lateralized readiness potentials reveal motor slowing in the aging brain	JOURNALS OF GERONTOLOGY SERIES B-PSYCHOLOGICAL SCIENCES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES			English	Article							EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; AGE-RELATED-CHANGES; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; MOTION; ONSET; PERCEPTION; MOVEMENT; P300	Older adults consistently show slower reaction times (RTs) to the onset of motion. Both cognitive slowing and motor slowing have been suggested as causes of this effect. The lateralized readiness potential (LRP) of the electroencephalogram can be used to separate perceptual and decision processes from motor programming and execution as causes of RT differences. We used the LRP to discern the origin of slowing in RT to motion onset that occurs in elderly individuals. After the onset of motion in a visual display, we asked participants to identify the direction of that motion (up or down) by pressing a button. Older participants showed significantly slower RTs than did younger participants. The LRP showed that the bulk of slowed response arose from slowed motor processes, rather than perceptual processing. We discuss the differences found in amplitude and onset latency of the LRP in the context of theories of motion processing and inhibition in the aging brain.

Research performed during the past decade has clarified our understanding of MTHFR deficiencies that cause homocystinuria or mild hyperhomocysteinemia. Our cloning of the MTHFR coding sequence was initially followed by the identification of the first deleterious mutations in MTHFR, in patients with homocystinuria and marked hyperhomocysteinemia. Shortly thereafter, we identified the 677C -> T variant and showed that it encoded a thermolabile enzyme with reduced activity. Currently, a total of 41 rare but deleterious mutations in MTHFR, as well as about 60 polymorphisms have been reported. The 677C -> T (Ala222Val) variant has been particularly noteworthy since it has become recognized as the most common genetic cause of hyperhomocysteinemia. The disruption of homocysteine metabolism by this polymorphism influences risk for several complex disorders, including cardiovascular disease, neural tube defects and some cancers. We describe here the complex structure of the MTHFR gene, summarize the current state of knowledge on rare and common mutations in MTHFR and discuss some relevant findings in a mouse model for MTHFR deficiency.

MEMORY & COGNITION			English	Article							FAMILIAR SONGS; MEMORY; MUSIC; TEXT; RECALL; MELODY; INTEGRATION; INFORMATION; WORDS; BRAIN	According to common practice and oral tradition, learning verbal materials through song should facilitate word recall. In the present study, we provide evidence against this belief In Experiment 1, 36 university students, half of them musicians, learned an unfamiliar song in three conditions. In the sung-sung condition, the song to be learned was sung, and the response was sung too. In the sung-spoken condition, the response was spoken. In the divided-spoken condition, the presented lyrics (accompanied by music) and the response were both spoken. Superior word recall in the sung-sung condition was predicted. However, fewer words were recalled when singing than when speaking. Furthermore, the mode of presentation, whether sung or spoken, had no influence on lyric recall, in either short- or long-term recall. In Experiment 2, singing was assessed with and without words. Altogether, the results indicate that the text and the melody of a song have separate representations in memory, making singing a dual task to perform, at least in the first steps of learning. Interestingly, musical training had little impact on performance, suggesting that vocal learning is a basic and widespread skill.

Application to specialised translation in biomedicine	META			French	Article								This paper presents some key researchers and theories that open the way for new types of research in translatology using a cognitive approach: Spinoza in philosophy, Damasio and Edelman in neurosciences, the Gestalt and the work of Lakoff, Talmy and Fauconnier in cognitive semantics. The main concepts will be placed within the cognitive science framework and we will explain why they are important for the practice of translation as well as in research. A few results taken from our work on conceptualisation modes in biomedicine will illustrate the proposed approach.

The genetic architecture of ASDs is complex, requiring large samples to overcome heterogeneity. Here we broaden coverage and sample size relative to other studies of ASDs by using Affymetrix 10K SNP arrays and 1,168 families with at least two affected individuals, performing the largest linkage scan to date while also analyzing copy number variation in these families. Linkage and copy number variation analyses implicate chromosome 11p12-p13 and neurexins, respectively, among other candidate loci. Neurexins team with previously implicated neuroligins for glutamatergic synaptogenesis, highlighting glutamate-related genes as promising candidates for contributing to ASDs.

Reduced GABA(B) receptor subunit expression and paired-pulse depression in a genetic model of absence seizures	NEUROBIOLOGY OF DISEASE			English	Article						absence seizures; GABA(B) receptor; immunofluorescence; paired-pulse depression; real-time PCR; WAG/Rij rats	SPIKE-WAVE DISCHARGES; B RECEPTORS; THALAMOCORTICAL OSCILLATIONS; GABAERGIC INHIBITION; PYRAMIDAL CELLS; SPLICE VARIANTS; RAT HIPPOCAMPUS; GB2 SUBUNITS; EPILEPSY; NEURONS	Neocortical networks play a major role in the genesis of generalized spike-and-wave (SW) discharges associated with absence seizures in humans and in animal models, including genetically predisposed WAG/Rij rats. Here, we tested the hypothesis that alterations in GABA(B) receptors contribute to neocortical hyperexcitability in these animals. By using Real-Time PCR we found that mRNA levels for most GABA(B(1)) subunits are diminished in epileptic WAG/Rij neocortex as compared with age-matched non-epileptic controls (NEC), whereas GABA(B(2)) mRNA is unchanged. Next, we investigated the cellular distribution of GABA(B(1)) and GABA(B(2)) subunits by confocal microscopy and discovered that GABA(B(1)) subunits fail to localize in the distal dendrites of WAG/Rij neocortical pyramidal cells. Intracellular recordings from neocortical cells in an in vitro slice preparation demonstrated reduced paired-pulse depression of pharmacologically isolated excitatory and inhibitory responses in epileptic WAG/Rij rats as compared with NECs; moreover, paired-pulse depression in NEC slices was diminished by a GABAB receptor antagonist to a greater extent than in WAG/Rij rats further suggesting GABAB receptor dysfunction. In conclusion, our data identify changes in GABAB receptor subunit expression and distribution along with decreased paired-pulse depression in epileptic WAG/Rij rat neocortex. We propose that these alterations may contribute to neocortical hyperexcitability and thus to SW generation in absence epilepsy. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Therefore, we used microPETand [C-11]raclopride to map the availability of dopamine D-2/3 receptors in brain of anesthetized rats, first in a baseline condition, and again after challenge with saline or D-amphetamine. Parametric maps of the specific binding (binding potential, pB) were calculated using a reference tissue input from cerebellum, and spatially normalized to a digitized stereotaxic coordinate system for rat brain. In volumes of interest (VOIs), the mean baseline pB (n=6) was 2.05 in dorsal striatum (caudate-putamen), and 1.34 in ventral striatum (nucleus accumbens), and did not significantly differ upon retest 2 h later. The availability of [C-11]raclopride binding sites at baseline was 8% higher in the right striatum. Challenge with amphetamine sulfate (1 mg/kg, i.v., n =4) decreased pB by 19% in both ventral and dorsal striation. We have earlier predicted that blockade of monoamine oxidase (MAO) should potentiate the amphetamine-evoked dopamine release, thus enhancing the displacement of [C-11]raclopride binding in vivo. However, pretreatment of rats with pargyline hydrochloride (4 mg/kg, n = 4; 20 mg/kg, n=4) 1 day prior to PET did not potentiate the amphetamine-evoked reduction in dopamine receptor availability within the extended striatum. We conclude that small animal PET can be used to investigate stimulant-induced dopamine release, but that the spatial resolution is insufficient to detect differences between relative changes in dorsal vs. ventral divisions of the rat striatum. Furthermore, the present results do not reveal potentiation of the amphetamine-evoked release of dopamine in rats with MAO inhibition. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Increasing numbers of macrophages in crushed rat sciatic nerves express NgR1 and NgR2 on the cell surface in the first week after injury. These macrophages show reduced binding to myelin and MAG in vitro, which is reversed by NgR siRNA knockdown and by inhibiting Rho-associated kinase. Fourteen days after sciatic nerve crush, regenerating nerves with newly synthesized myelin have fewer macrophages than cut/ligated nerves that lack axons and myelin. Almost all macrophages in the cut/ligated nerves lie within the Schwann cell basal lamina, while in the crushed regenerating nerves the majority migrate out. Furthermore, crush-injured nerves of NgR1 and MAG-deficient mice and Y-27632-treated rats show impaired macrophage efflux from Schwann cell basal lamina containing myelinated axons. These data have implications for the resolution of inflammation in peripheral nerve and CNS pathologies.

Current- and voltage-clamp recordings were made from somatosensory neurons of neocortex and some thalamocortical neurons in coronal brain slices of rats. We compared effects of pentobarbital, amobarbital, and phenobarbital on inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) mediated by gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), input conductance, and evoked action potential firing. In neocortex, pentobarbital (EC50 = 41 mu M) and amobarbital (EC50 = 103 mu M) increased the decay time constant of GABA(A)ergic IPSCs. At higher concentrations, pentobarbital and amobarbital shunted firing by increasing input conductance through agonism at GABA(A) receptors. At anti-epileptic concentrations, phenobarbital increased the IPSC decay time constant (EC50 = 144 mu M), and shunted firing by agonism at GABA(A) receptors (EC50 = 133 mu M). In thalamocortical neurons, similar concentrations of phenobarbital had negligible effects on GABA(A)ergic IPSCs, conductance, and firing. In contrast to their thalamic actions, barbiturates inhibit neocortical neurons mostly through GABA receptors. Neocortical enhancement of inhibition by pentobarbital and amobarbital, combined with actions on thalamocortical neurons, may contribute to redundant mechanisms of anesthesia. The ability of phenobarbital at anti-epileptic concentrations to inhibit neocortical firing by direct activation and modulation of GABA(A) receptors relates to its specialized therapeutic effects.

As blockade of the serotonin type 2a ( 5- HT2a) receptors is a common property of the newer antipsychotics, the present study compared the effect of haloperidol, clozapine, and M100907 ( a selective 5- HT2a antagonist) and the combined effect of haloperidol and M100907 treatment on brain stimulation reward ( BSR). Experiments were performed on male Sprague - Dawley rats trained to produce an operant response to obtain electrical stimulation in the lateral hypothalamus. Measures of reward threshold were determined in different groups of rats using the curve- shift method using fixed current intensity and variable frequency before and at different times after injection of haloperidol ( 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, and 0.25 mg/ kg), clozapine ( 1, 7.5, 15, and 30 mg/ kg), M100907 ( 0.033, 0.1, and 0.3 mg/ kg), or their vehicle. The effect of M100907 ( 0.3 mg/ kg) on the attenuation of BSR by a sub- and suprathreshold dose of haloperidol was studied in another group of rats. Clozapine produced a dose- orderly increase in reward threshold with a mean maximal increase of 50%; at high doses, clozapine induced cessation of responding in several animals at different time periods. Haloperidol induced a dose- dependent increase in reward threshold, with the mean maximal increase ( 75%) being observed at the highest dose; it also produced a dose- dependent reduction of maximum rates of responding. M100907 failed to alter reward at any of the doses tested and had no effect on the subthreshold dose ( 0.01 mg/ kg) of haloperidol. But when combined with a suprathreshold dose of haloperidol, M100907 reduced the reward- attenuating effect of haloperidol. These results show that 5- HT2a receptors are unlikely to constitute a component of the reward- relevant pathway activated by lateral hypothalamic stimulation. However, blockade of 5- HT2a receptors may account for the relatively lower level of reward attenuation produced by clozapine, and predict that antipsychotic medications that have a high affinity for the 5- HT2a receptor may be less likely to induce dysphoria.

Training-induced brain remapping in chronic aphasia: A pilot study	NEUROREHABILITATION AND NEURAL REPAIR			English	Article						aphasia recovery; speech rehabilitation; fMRI; phonological training; brain reorganization; anomia	LANGUAGE ACTIVATION; POSTSTROKE APHASIA; FRONTAL-CORTEX; RECOVERY; PET; PLASTICITY; STROKE; THERAPY; RETRIEVAL; HEALTHY	Background. The neural correlates of training-induced improvements of cognitive functions after brain damage remain still scarcely understood. In the specific case of aphasia, although several investigations have addressed the issue of the neural substrates of functional recovery, only a few studies have attempted to assess the impact of language training on the damaged brain. Aims. The main goal of this study was to examine the neurobiological correlates of improved picture-naming performance in 2 aphasic patients who received intensive and specific training for a chronic and severe phonological anomia. Methods. In both participants, picture-naming performance was assessed before and after phonological cueing training. Training-induced changes in patients' performance were correlated to brain activity patterns as revealed by pre- and post-training event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging scanning. Results. Training-induced improvement was observed concurrently with changes in the brain activation patterns. Better performance was observed in the patient with the smaller lesion, partially sparing Broca's area, who showed a left perilesional reactivation. Conversely, the patient with complete destruction of Broca's area showed a posttraining activation in the right mirror frontal region. Conclusions. The results show that, even in the chronic stage, phonological strategies may improve impaired naming and induce cerebral reorganization.

We examined neuropsychiatric symptoms among formerly Mn-exposed workers 14 years after cessation of exposure. Materials and methods: A study was conducted in 1990 among workers from a ferro- and silico-Mn plant and unexposed working men referents from the same region in South-West Quebec. At follow-up in 2004, 77 former Mn-workers and 81 referents agreed to participate and responded to a neuropsychiatric symptom checklist, the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI); scores were transformed into T-scores based on a normative population. Cumulated exposure indices (CEI) were computed for each former Mn-worker. Linear and logistic regression analyses were used. Results: Mean T-scores were significantly higher among former Mn-workers than referents on scales of Depression and Anxiety. Mean T-scores of psychological distress increased with the CEI tertiles, with significant associations for the scales Somatization, Depression, Anxiety and Hostility. Former Mn-workers in the two highest tertiles of CEI showed a higher risk for T-scores >= 63 for Hostility (OR, 7.5; 95% CI 1.5-38.9), Depression (OR, 2.6; 95 % CI, 1. 1-8.4) and Anxiety (OR, 3.0; 95 % CI, 1. 1-8.4). Conclusion: These results suggest that past exposure to Mn may have lasting consequences on neuropsychiatric symptoms. (c) 2006 Published by Elsevier Inc.

Although an essential metal, Mn overexposure may cause manganism, a parkinsonian syndrome. The present welder study sought to improve the clinical portrait of manganism and to determine dose-effect relationships. The welders were employed in the construction of the new Bay Bridge (San Francisco) and welded in confined spaces for up to 2 years with minimal protection and poor ventilation. Neurological, neuropsychological, neurophysiological, and pulmonary examinations were given to 49 welders. Clinical cases were selected on the basis of apriori defined criteria pertaining to welding history and neurological/neuropsychological features. Among the 43 eligible welders, I I cases of manganism were identified presenting with the following symptoms: sleep disturbance, mood changes, bradykinesia, headaches, sexual dysfunction, olfaction loss, muscular rigidity, tremors, hallucinations, slurred speech, postural instability, monotonous voice, and facial masking. Significant associations between outcome variables and cumulative exposure index (CEI) or blood Mn (MnB) were obtained with CEI for variables implicating attention and concentration, working and immediate memory, cognitive flexibility, and verbal learning; and with MnB for executive function, cognitive flexibility, visuo-spatial construction ability, and visual contrast sensitivity. This study strongly suggests that neuropsychological features contribute in a dose-effect related way to the portrait of manganism usually characterized by tremor, loss in balance, diminished cognitive performance, and signs and symptoms of parkinsonism.

Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the feasibility of study design, methods, and the measurement of desired outcomes for the development of a larger multicentered study. lo Results: Study findings were used to estimate effect size, determine staff and bedside care organization, evaluate feasibility of data collection measures, and identify issues related to recruitment and follow-up. Results were incorporated in the development of a larger multicentered trial grant proposal. Discussion: Pilot studies can play an important role in the development of a competitive grant proposal and efficient conduct of a research trial. Pilot studies strengthen a proposal by providing essential baseline information. A general overview of the purpose of pilot studies is provided here, along with a description of the process of using findings from a pilot study to inform the development of a larger multisite trial. Findings from this pilot study examining the effects of co-bedding on twins and their parents are used to revise the research protocol for a larger multisite trial. These changes, which lead to improvement to the protocol, and the rational for these changes are highlighted.

Pharmacological management of chronic neuropathic pain - Consensus statement and guidelines from the Canadian Pain Society	PAIN RESEARCH & MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Analgesic agents; Neuropathic pain; Randomized controlled trials		Neuropathic pain (NeP), generated by disorders of the peripheral and central nervous system, can be particularly severe and disabling. Prevalence estimates indicate that 2% to 3% of the population in the developed world suffer from NeP, which suggests that up to one million Canadians have this disabling condition. Evidence-based guidelines for the pharmacological management of NeP are therefore urgently needed. Randomized, controlled trials, systematic reviews and existing guidelines focusing on the pharmacological management of NeP were evaluated at a consensus meeting. Medications are recommended in the guidelines if their analgesic efficacy was supported by at least one methodologically sound, randomized, controlled trial showing significant benefit relative to placebo or another relevant control group. Recommendations for treatment are based on degree of evidence of analgesic efficacy, safety, ease of use and cost-effectiveness. Analgesic agents recommended for first-line treatments are certain antidepressants (tricyclics) and anticonvulsants (gabapentin and pregabalin). Second-line treatments recommended are serotonin noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors and topical lidocaine. Tramadol and controlled-release opioid analgesics are recommended as third-line treatments for moderate to severe pain. Recommended fourth-line treatments include cannabinoids, methadone and anticonvulsants with lesser evidence of efficacy, such as lamotrigine, topiramate and valproic acid. Treatment must be individualized for each patient based on efficacy, side-effect profile and drug accessibility, including cost. Further studies are required to examine head-to-head comparisons among analgesics, combinations of analgesics, long-term outcomes, and treatment of pediatric and central NeP.	[Moulin, D.

In most cases, PNDs involve the peripheral nerves. Treatment of PNDs is likely to use large health care resources. However, little is known about the economic burden of PNDs in Canada. METHOD: The present study was performed using data from a random sample of patients covered by the Regie de l'Assurance Maladie du Quebec drug plan. Subjects with a diagnosis of a peripheral PND were identified. Comorbidities, pain-related medication use and resource utilization were compared between PND patients and control patients without PNDs matched for age and sex in a 1: 1 ratio. RESULTS: A total of 4912 patients with PNDs were identified. A higher level of comorbidities was found in the PND group (Von Korff chronic disease score 3.91 versus 2.54; P<0.001). The proportion of users of pain-related medications was significantly higher in the PND cohort than in the control group (chi(2); P<0.001). The average annual number of physician visits was also significantly higher in the PND group than in the control group (14.7 versus 6.4; P<0.001). From a health ministry perspective, costs of health care resources were significantly higher in the PND group ($4,163 versus $1,846; P<0.001). The proportion of potentially inappropriate medications was 34% among those 65 years of age or older. CONCLUSIONS: PNDs are associated with a higher level of comorbidities, higher medical resources utilization and higher health care costs than non-PND conditions.

A genetic framework using contextual knowledge for segmentation and recognition of handwritten numeral strings	PATTERN RECOGNITION			English	Article						handwritten digit recognition; handwritten numeral string segmentation; handwritten numeral string recognition; genetic algorithm; contextual knowledge	DIGIT RECOGNITION	For the first time, a genetic framework using contextual knowledge is proposed for segmentation and recognition of unconstrained handwritten numeral strings. New algorithms have been developed to locate feature points on the string image, and to generate possible segmentation hypotheses. A genetic representation scheme is utilized to show the space of all segmentation hypotheses (chromosomes). For the evaluation of segmentation hypotheses, a novel evaluation scheme is introduced, in order to improve the outlier resistance of the system. Our genetic algorithm tries to search and evolve the population of segmentation hypotheses, and to find the one with the highest segmentation/recognition confidence. The NIST NSTRING SD19 and CENPARMI databases were used to evaluate the performance of our proposed method. Our experiments showed that proper use of contextual knowledge in segmentation, evaluation and search greatly improves the overall performance of the system. On average, our system was able to obtain correct recognition rates of 95.28% and 96.42% on handwritten numeral strings using neural network and support vector classifiers, respectively. These results compare favorably with the ones reported in the literature. (c) 2006 Pattern Recognition Society. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Thiopental-induced neutropenia in two patients with severe head trauma	PHARMACOTHERAPY			English	Article						thiopental; barbiturates; neutropenia; nuclear factor-kappa B; calcineurin	NF-KAPPA-B; VANCOMYCIN-INDUCED NEUTROPENIA; DRUG-INDUCED AGRANULOCYTOSIS; NUCLEAR-FACTOR; GRANULOCYTE APOPTOSIS; BARBITURATE COMA; INHIBITION; ACTIVATION; SUPPRESSION; RESPONSES	Thiopental has been used for decades in the treatment of refractory intracranial hypertension in patients with traumatic and nontraumatic head injuries. Commonly reported adverse effects include hypotension, hypokalemia, respiratory complications, and hepatic dysfunction. Neutropenia has rarely been reported as an adverse effect of thiopental. We witnessed probable thiopental-induced neutropenia in two patients with traumatic brain injuries who developed increased intracranial hypertension that was refractory to standard therapy. Based on a MEDLINE search of published case reports and literature, we propose two mechanisms by which thiopental-related neutropenia might be explained. The first is inhibition of inflammatory mediator nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B), leading to granulocyte apoptosis. The second mechanism involves inhibition of calcineurin. Although the precise link between these two mechanisms has not been elucidated, calcineurin is known to regulate NF-kappa B activity. Development of neutropenia does not appear to be correlated with time but may correlate with plasma concentrations of thiopental. The optimum management of drug-induced neutropenia is unclear. The decision to discontinue thiopental in patients who develop neutropenia should be made by weighing the risks versus benefits. Broad-spectrum antibiotics may be required in the presence of fever. The role of hematopoietic growth factors such as granulocyte colony-stimulating factor is not yet defined. Given the adverse infectious consequences of neutropenia, it is essential to closely monitor neutrophil counts in patients receiving thiopental.

J	Beauregard, M				Beauregard, Mario			Mind does really matter: Evidence from neuroimaging studies of emotional self-regulation, psychotherapy, and placebo effect	PROGRESS IN NEUROBIOLOGY			English	Review						emotional-self-regulation; psychotherapy; placebo effect; brain; mind; neuroimaging; fMRI; PET; SPECT; Psychoneural Translation Hypothesis	COGNITIVE-BEHAVIORAL THERAPY; ORBITAL FRONTAL-CORTEX; OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE DISORDER; ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; HUMAN PREFRONTAL CORTEX; SPECIAL TOPIC PAPERS; ORBITOFRONTAL CORTEX; PHYSIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE; FUNCTIONAL NEUROANATOMY; VOLUNTARY SUPPRESSION	This article reviews neuroimaging studies of conscious and voluntary regulation of various emotional states (sexual arousal, sadness, negative emotion). The results of these studies show that metacognition and cognitive recontextualization selectively alters the way the brain processes and reacts to emotional stimuli. Neuroimaging studies of the effect of psychotherapy in patients suffering from diverse forms of psychopathology (obsessive-compulsive disorder, panic disorder, unipolar major depressive disorder, social phobia, spider phobia, borderline personality) are also examined. The results of these studies indicate that the mental functions and processes involved in diverse forms of psychotherapy exert a significant influence on brain activity. Neuroimaging investigations of the placebo effect in healthy individuals (placebo analgesia, psychos-timulant expectation) and patients with Parkinson's disease or unipolar major depressive disorder are also reviewed. The results of these investigations demonstrate that beliefs and expectations can markedly modulate neurophysiological and neurochemical activity in brain regions involved in perception, movement, pain, and various aspects of emotion processing. Collectively, the findings of the neuroimaging studies reviewed here strongly support the view that the subjective nature and the intentional content (what they are "about" from a first-person perspective) of mental processes (e.g., thoughts, feelings, beliefs, volition) significantly influence the various levels of brain functioning (e.g., molecular, cellular, neural circuit) and brain plasticity. Furthermore, these findings indicate that mentalistic variables have to be seriously taken into account to reach a correct understanding of the neural bases of behavior in humans. An attempt is made to interpret the results of these neuroimaging studies with a new theoretical framework called the Psychoneural Translation Hypothesis. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Materials and Methods: Institutional review board approval was obtained, informed consent was waived, and data and other information were obtained prior to implementation of HIPAA. A review was performed of 264 patients (mean age, 65 years; 158 men and 106 women) with NSCLC who had undergone imaging studies of the chest and head. Hierarchical logistic regression was used to determine the predicted probability of metastatic disease to the brain as a function of patient age and sex and of size, cell type, peripheral versus central location, and lymph node stage of the primary NSCLC. Results: Ninety-five (36%) patients had evidence of metastatic disease to the brain. Mean diameter of the primary tumors was 4.0 cm +/- 2.2 (standard deviation). Cell types included adenocarcinoma (136 [52%] patients), undifferentiated (68 [26%] patients), and squamous (47 [18%] patients), for which metastatic disease to the brain occurred in 43%, 41%, and 13% (P = .003) of patients, respectively. The predicted probability of metastatic disease to the brain correlated positively with size of the primary tumor (P < .001), cell type (adenocarcinoma and undifferentiated vs squamous, P = .001), and lymph node stage (P < .017) but did not correlate with age, sex, or primary tumor location. For primary adenocarcinoma without lymph node spread, the predicted probabilities of metastatic disease to the brain from 2-and 6-cm primary tumors were .14 (95% confidence interval: .06, .27) and.72 (95% confidence interval: .48, .88), respectively (P < .02). Conclusion: The probability of metastatic disease to the brain from primary NSCLC is correlated with size of the primary tumor, cell type, and intrathoracic lymph node stage. (c) RSNA, 2007.

Electrical stimulation of the epidural space using a catheter with a removable stylet	REGIONAL ANESTHESIA AND PAIN MEDICINE			English	Article						epidural analgesia; epidural stimulation; stylet	NERVE-STIMULATION; PLACEMENT; CONFIRMATION; ANALGESIA; NEEDLE	Background and Objectives: Electrical stimulation can be used to verify the location of epidural catheters. With the traditional technique, the latter must be primed with saline to allow for electrical conduction: any air lock will, thus, hinder the flow of current. Therefore, we set out to explore an alternative mode of stimulation by use of a catheter containing a removable stylet. This study examines the reliability of this new technique. Methods: In 71 patients undergoing surgery, a thoracic epidural catheter was inserted preoperatively. Loss of resistance was used to identify the epidural space. The TheraCath was introduced 5 cm into the space and connected to a neurostimulator via a 2-headed alligator clip. The intensity, pulse width, and level of myotomal contractions were recorded upon stimulation of the epidural space. A bolus of lidocaine was then injected and the patient assessed for sensory block to ice. Results: The failure rate in proper epidural catheter placement was 8.5%. Epidural stimulation yielded a mean threshold of 1.90 +/- 1.80 nanocoulombs. A total of 37 catheters produced a unilateral muscular response; however, block to ice was bilateral. When compared with the ice test, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of epidural stimulation with the TheraCath were 92%, 83%, 98%, and 50%, respectively. Conclusion: We conclude that the TheraCath, because of the removable stylet, provides effective electro-stimulation of the epidural space. its use was simple and devoid of complications. Nonetheless, further studies are required before implementing its routine use in clinical settings.

J	Henderson, A; Korner-Bitensky, N; Levin, M				Henderson, Amy; Korner-Bitensky, Nicol; Levin, Mindy			Virtual reality in stroke rehabilitation: A systematic review of its effectiveness for upper limb motor recovery	TOPICS IN STROKE REHABILITATION			English	Review						rehabilitation; review; stroke; upper limb; virtual reality	CONSTRAINT-INDUCED THERAPY; BRAIN-DAMAGE; ARM; INTENSITY; TASK	Purpose: It is estimated that 50% to 75% of individuals who experience a stroke have persistent impairment of the affected upper limb (UL). There is a need to identify the best training strategies for retraining motor function of the UL. One intervention showing promise is virtual reality (VR), using either immersive or nonimmersive technology. Before recommending VR for use in clinical practice, it is important to understand the evidence regarding its effectiveness. Method: Two questions about the effectiveness of VR for UL rehabilitation in stroke were posed: (1) Is the use of immersive VR more effective than conventional therapy or no therapy in the rehabilitation of the UL in patients with hemiplegia? (2) Is the use of nonimmersive VR more effective than conventional therapy or no therapy in the rehabilitation of the UL in patients with hemiplegia? Results: There is level 1b evidence suggesting an advantage to training in immersive VR environments versus no therapy in UL rehabilitation, and level 5 evidence for training in immersive VR versus conventional therapy. There is level 4 evidence showing conflicting results for training in nonimmersive VR versus no therapy, and level 2b evidence for training in nonimmersive VR versus conventional therapy. Conclusion: The current evidence on the effectiveness of using VR in the rehabilitation of the UL in patients with stroke is limited but sufficiently encouraging to justify additional clinical trials in this population.

Effects of residential distance to hospitals with neonatal surgery care on prenatal management and outcome of pregnancies with severe fetal malformations	ULTRASOUND IN OBSTETRICS & GYNECOLOGY			English	Article						congenital malformation; diaphragmatic hernia; gastroschisis; maternal origin; omphalocele; spina bilida; traveling distance	BIRTH-WEIGHT INFANTS; NEURAL-TUBE DEFECTS; CONGENITAL DIAPHRAGMATIC-HERNIA; DIAGNOSIS; MORTALITY; LEVEL; TERMINATION; PREVALENCE; UNIVERSITY; EUROPE	Objectives To examine the effect of maternal origin and distance between maternal residence and the nearest maternity ward with a neonatal surgical center in the same hospital, on prenatal diagnosis, elective termination of pregnancy, delivery in an adequate place and neonatal mortality for pregnancies with severe malformations requiring neonatal surgery, and to examine the effect of the place of delivery on neonatal mortality. Methods This was a retrospective study, through the France Central-East malformation registry, of 706 fetuses with omphalocele (n = 123), gastroschisis (n = 99), diaphragmatic hernia (n = 222), or spina bifida (n = 262), but without chromosomal anomalies. Maternal origin was classified as Western European and non-Western European. Adequate place for delivery was defined as birth in a Level-III maternity ward with a neonatal surgical center in the same hospital. Results The prenatal diagnosis rate was 67.7% in 1990-1995 and 80.2% in 1996-2001 (odds ratio (OR), 2.07 (95% CI, 1.24-3.45)). On multivariate analysis, the rate was significantly lower for women living 11-50 km (adjusted OR, 0.49 (95% CI, 0.25-0.94)), or > 50 km (adjusted OR, 0.39 (0.20-0.74)) from the closest adequate place of delivery, compared with those living < 11 km from it, but there was no difference for maternal origin. Non-Western European women had fewer elective terminations of pregnancy (adjusted OR, 0.34 (95% CI, 0.14-0.81)) and fewer deliveries in an adequate place (adjusted OR, 0.40 (95% CI, 0.18-0.89)). Neonatal mortality was lower in the case of delivery in an adequate place (adjusted OR, 0.22 (95% CI, 0.07-0.72)) and was not associated with maternal origin and distance from nearest maternity ward with a neonatal surgical center. Conclusion Rate of prenatal diagnosis decreases with increasing distance between parental residence and referral center. Non-Western European women are diagnosed prenatally as often as are Western Europeans, but terminate their pregnancy less often, perhaps for cultural reasons. Non-Western European women with malformed fetuses deliver in adequate centers less often, probably because of the way the perinatal care system is run. Copyright (c) 2007 ISUOG.

The spatial feature underlying the shape-frequency and shape-amplitude after-effects	VISION RESEARCH			English	Article						contour-shape; adaptation; shape-frequency after-effect; shape-amplitude after-effect; curvature; tilt after-effect	TEXTURE DENSITY; VISUAL-CORTEX; AREA V4; HUMAN VISION; CURVATURE DETECTORS; CARTESIAN GRATINGS; DISCRIMINATION; ADAPTATION; PERCEPTION; CONTRAST	The shape-frequency and shape-amplitude after-effects, or SFAE and SAAE, refer respectively to the shifts observed in the perceived shape-frequency and shape-amplitude of a sinusoidal test contour following adaptation to a similar-shaped contour. As with other shape after-effects the shifts are in a direction away from that of the adapting stimulus. Using a variety of procedures we tested whether the spatial feature that was adapted in the SFAE and SAAE was (a) local orientation, (b) average unsigned curvature, (c) periodicity/density, (d) shape-amplitude and (e) local curvature. Our results suggest that the last of these, local curvature, underlies both the SFAE and SAAE, The evidence in favour of local curvature was that the after-effect reached its maximum value when just half-a-cycle of the test contour, in cosine phase, was present. We suggest that the SFAE and SAAE are mediated by intermediate-level mechanisms that encode the shapes of contour fragments with constant sign of curvature. Given the neurophysiological evidence that neurons in area V4 encode parts of shapes with constant sign of curvature, we suggest V4 is the likely neural substrate for both the SFAE and SAAE.

Lithium (Li) has been used for over 40 years now as an effective prophylactic agent. Response to Li treatment seems to be, at least in part, genetically determined. Although we ignore how Li specifically prevents mood episodes, it has previously been suggested that Li exerts an effect on the phosphoinositide pathway, and more recently, it has been proposed that Li may modulate prolyl endopeptidase (PREP). Methods: In this study we carried out an association study looking at the PREP gene, located on ch 6q22. Five intronic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP), three coding SNPs and one SNP in the 5' UTR were investigated for their frequency in a BD sample of 180 excellent Li responders, 69 Li nonresponders and 126 controls. Genotyping was carried out using the SNaPshot reaction from Applied Biosystems, which is a modified fluorescent single base pair extension procedure. Results: Following correction for multiple testing, no significant genotypic, allelic or estimated haplotypic differences were found between responders and nonresponders or between BD patients and controls. Conclusion: PREP is an interesting candidate gene to investigate in genetic studies of BD, but our findings do not support the hypothesis that genetic variation in this gene plays a major role in the etiology of BD or Li response.

Dynamic changes in GABA(A) receptors on basal forebrain cholinergic neurons following sleep deprivation and recovery	BMC NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							NEOCORTICAL SYNAPSES; GABAERGIC SYNAPSES; PARADOXICAL SLEEP; ANESTHETIZED RATS; NUCLEUS BASALIS; C-FOS; ASSOCIATION; EEG; HOMEOSTASIS; BRAIN	Background: The basal forebrain (BF) cholinergic neurons play an important role in cortical activation and arousal and are active in association with cortical activation of waking and inactive in association with cortical slow wave activity of sleep. In view of findings that GABA(A) receptors (Rs) and inhibitory transmission undergo dynamic changes as a function of prior activity, we investigated whether the GABA(A)Rs on cholinergic cells might undergo such changes as a function of their prior activity during waking vs. sleep. Results: In the brains of rats under sleep control (SC), sleep deprivation (SD) or sleep recovery (SR) conditions in the 3 hours prior to sacrifice, we examined immunofluorescent staining for B2-3 subunit GABA(A)Rs on choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) immunopositive (+) cells in the magnocellular BF. In sections also stained for c-Fos, beta 2-3 GABA(A)Rs were present on ChAT+ neurons which expressed c-Fos in the SD group alone and were variable or undetectable on other ChAT+ cells across groups. In dual-immunostained sections, the luminance of beta(2-3) GABA(A)Rs over the membrane of ChAT+ cells was found to vary significantly across conditions and to be significantly higher in SD than SC or SR groups. Conclusion: We conclude that membrane GABAARs increase on cholinergic cells as a result of activity during sustained waking and reciprocally decrease as a result of inactivity during sleep. These changes in membrane GABAARs would be associated with increased GABA-mediated inhibition of cholinergic cells following prolonged waking and diminished inhibition following sleep and could thus reflect a homeostatic process regulating cholinergic cell activity and thereby indirectly cortical activity across the sleep-waking cycle.

Interneuron and pyramidal cell network interactions underlie this activity, but contributions of interneuron voltage-gated membrane conductances remain unclear. We show that interneurons at the CA1 lacunosum-moleculare (LM) and radiatum (RAD) junction (LM/RAD) display voltage-dependent subthreshold membrane potential oscillations (MPOs) generated by voltage-gated tetrodotoxin-sensitive Na+ and 4-aminopyridine (4-AP)-sensitive K+ currents. They also exhibit prominent 4-AP-sensitive A-type K+ currents, with gating properties showing activation at subthreshold membrane potentials. We found that LM/RAD cells are part of specific interneuron subpopulations expressing the K+ channel subunit Kv4.3 and their transfection with Kv4.3 small interfering RNA selectively impaired A-type K+ currents and MPOs. Thus, our findings reveal a novel function of Kv4.3-mediated A-type K+ currents in the generation of intrinsic MPOs in specific subpopulations of interneurons that may participate in hippocampal theta-related rhythmic activity.

Using co-immunoprecipitation approaches, we demonstrated here that NTS1 forms constitutive heterodimers with NTS2 in transfected COS-7 cells. We also showed that co-expression of NTS2 with NTS1 markedly decreases the cell surface density of NTS1 without affecting ERK1/2 MAPK activity or NT-induced NTS1 internalization. However, radioligand-binding studies indicated that upon prolonged NT stimulation, cell surface NTS1 receptors are more resistant to down-regulation in cells co-expressing NTS1 and NTS2 than in cells expressing NTS1 alone. Taken together, these data suggest that NTS1/NTS2 heterodimerization affects the intracellular distribution and trafficking of NTS1 by making it more similar to that of NTS2 as witnessed in cells expressing NTS2 alone. NTS1/NTS2 heterodimerization might therefore represent an additional mechanism in the regulation of NT-triggered responses mediated by NTS1 and NTS2 receptors. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

They can undergo rapid actin-based activity-dependent shape fluctuations, an intriguing biophysical property that is believed to alter synaptic transmission. Yet, because of their small size (similar to 1 mu m or less) and metastable behavior, spines are inaccessible to most physical measurement techniques. Here we employ atomic force microscopy elasticity mapping and novel dynamic indentation methods to probe the biomechanics of dendritic spines in living neurons. We find that spines exhibit 1), a wide range of rigidities, correlated with morphological characteristics, axonal association, and glutamatergic stimulation, 2), a uniquely large viscosity, four to five times that of other cell types, consistent with a high density of solubilized proteins, and 3), weak power-law rheology, described by the soft-glassy model for cellular mechanics. Our findings provide a new perspective on spine functionality and identify key mechanical properties that govern the ability of spines to rapidly remodel and regulate internal protein trafficking but also maintain structural stability.

It has been speculated that idling neurons in the penumbra zone remain viable several years after injury and might be reactivated by enhanced oxygenation. We studied the therapeutic potential of HBO2 therapy in a 54-year-old man who had sustained traumatic brain injuries one year before testing that resulted in permanent neurological symptoms. Methods: Two treatment series separated by a one-year inter-session interval were administered. Treatment series consisted of 20 and 60 daily one-hour exposures to 100% oxygen at 2 ATA. Electrophysiological (event-related potentials), metabolic and behavioral (sensorimotor and neuropsychological) measurements were obtained to evaluate the effects of hyperbaric oxygen therapy on neurocognitive functioning. Results: Following the initial treatment, the patient showed improvements in sensorimotor functions, as well as enhanced P300 amplitude in the damaged hemisphere. Although most of these gains were no longer observed one year after treatment, these were reinstated with an additional series of 60 exposures. Neuropsychological improvements were also observed after the completion of the second series of treatments. Conclusion: The present single-case study provides preliminary evidence of neuropsychological and electrophysiological improvements after series of 20 and 60 treatments, although the first dosage appeared to be insufficient to produce permanent benefits. Longitudinal studies using different treatment parameters should be conducted if we are to systematically investigate long-term improvements resulting from HBO2 therapy. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Recently, a rat model of PD was developed using a synthetic proteasome inhibitor (PSI), (Z-Ile-Glu(OtBu)-Ala-Leu-al). We attempted to transfer this model to mouse studies, where genetics can be more readily investigated due to the availability of genetically modified mice. We treated C57BL/6 (B6) mice with six intraperitoneal injections of 6 mg/kg PSI in 50 mu l of 70% ethanol over a 2-week-period. We found significant decreases in nigrostriatal dopamine in PSI-treated mice compared with saline-treated mice. However, we observed similar decreases in the ethanol-treated vehicle control group. Administration of ethanol alone led to significant long-term alterations in dopamine levels. Ethanol significantly eclipses the effects of PSI in the dopamine system, and therefore is a confounding vehicle for this model. (C) 2007 Movement Disorder Society.

This paper presents a methodology for developing unbiased, high resolution iterative registration templates from a group of 222 subject hemispheres and shows that the resulting template provides better alignment of a separate set of test data than single-subject templates. It demonstrates that between 30 and 50 subjects are required to generate a stable iterative template. It also explores the way in which fold variants in registration templates affect the quality of registration. Finally, it shows that hemisphere-specific group registration templates systematically better register subject hemispheres of the same laterality, underlining the need to develop templates free of hemisphere bias for asymmetry analysis.

Acute prefrontal cortex TMS in healthy volunteers: Effects on brain C-11-alpha Mtrp trapping	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						TMS; PET; serotonin	TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; CEREBRAL-BLOOD-FLOW; POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; SEROTONIN SYNTHESIS RATES; DORSAL RAPHE NUCLEUS; MAJOR DEPRESSION; ELECTROCONVULSIVE-THERAPY; RTMS; TRYPTOPHAN; MOOD	High-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (LDLPFC) is a technique with purported efficacy as a treatment for major depression. Here, we assessed in vivo, in healthy volunteers, the effect of acute rTMS of the LDLPFC, relative to the stimulation of the left occipital cortex (LOC), on brain regional serotonin synthesis capacity, using the [C-11]-alphamethyl-tryptophan (C-11-alpha Mtrp)/PET method. Ten subjects were studied twice, once following rTMS of the LDLPFC and once following rTMS of the LOC in a randomized counterbalanced order. Three blocks of 15 trains of 10 Hz rTMS were delivered 10 min apart. Behavioural and autonomic measures were recorded before and after each rTMS session. Comparisons of TMS-related changes in regional normalized brain uptake and trapping of C-11-alpha Mtrp (K*) values were carried out using SPM99. Statistically significant regional differences were identified on the basis of an extent threshold of 50 voxels, with a peak threshold of p=0.005 uncorrected. Behavioural and autonomic measures were unaffected by rTMS. Relative to LOC stimulation, LDLPFC rTMS was associated with marked changes in normalized K* in limbic areas, with significantly lower values in the left parahippocampal gyrus (BA 28) and the right insula (BA 13), and higher values in the right cingulate gyros (BA 31) and cuneus (BA 18). These findings indicate that acute rTMS of the LDLPFC in healthy volunteers modulates aspects of tryptophan/5-HT metabolism in limbic areas. Such adaptive changes may contribute to the mechanism of action of prefrontal rTMS in major depression. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Identification of CRMP4 as a convergent regulator of axon outgrowth inhibition	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Nogo; CRMP; TUC; glial scar; CNS regeneration; myelin inhibition; Rho GTPase	MYELIN-ASSOCIATED GLYCOPROTEIN; GROWTH CONE COLLAPSE; NEURITE OUTGROWTH; RHO-KINASE; MOTOR-NEURONS; IN-VIVO; NOGO-A; PHOSPHORYLATION; REGENERATION; PROTEIN	Myelin-associated inhibitors (MAIs) and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) contribute to failed regeneration after neuronal injury. MAIs and CSPGs stimulate intracellular signals including the activation of RhoA and Rho kinase to block axonal extension through targeted modifications to the cytoskeleton. RhoA and ROCK are promising targets for therapeutic intervention to promote CNS repair; however, their ubiquitous expression will limit the specificity of drugs targeted to these molecules. We have identified the cytosolic phosphoprotein CRMP4b (collapsin-response mediator protein 4b) as a protein that physically and functionally interacts with RhoA to mediate neurite outgrowth inhibition. Short interfering RNA- mediated knockdown of CRMP4 promotes neurite outgrowth on myelin substrates, indicating a critical role for CRMP4b neurite outgrowth inhibition. Disruption of CRMP4b-RhoA binding with a competitive inhibitor attenuates neurite outgrowth inhibition on myelin and aggrecan substrates. Stimulation of neuronal growth cones with Nogo leads to colocalization of CRMP4b and RhoA at discrete regions within the actin-rich central and peripheral domains of the growth cone, indicative of a potential function in cytoskeletal rearrangements during neurite outgrowth inhibition. Together, these data indicate that a RhoA-CRMP4b complex forms in response to inhibitory challenges in the growth cone environment and regulates cytoskeletal dynamics at distinct sites necessary for axon outgrowth inhibition. Competitive inhibition of CRMP4b-RhoA binding suggests a novel, highly specific therapeutic avenue for promoting regeneration after CNS injury.

Poly(ethylene oxide)-b-poly(epsilon-caprolactone) (PEO-b-PCL) copolymer was synthesized by ring-opening polymerization, and the hydroxyl end group of the PCL block was modified with thioctic acid using dicyclohexyl carbodiimide as the coupling reagent. The PEO-b-PCL-thioctate ester (TE) thus obtained was used in a later step to form monolayer protected gold nanoparticles via the thioctate spacer. Gold nanoparticles stabilized with the PEO-b-PCL block (named Au/Block (x/y), where x/y is the mole feed ratio between HAuCl4 and PEO-b-PCL-TE) were prepared and analyzed. Au/Block (1/1), Au/Block (2/1), and Au/Block (3/1) nanoparticles were found to form stable dispersions in the organic solvents commonly used to dissolve the unlabeled block copolymer. The average diameter of the nanoparticles was determined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and found to be 6 +/- 2 nm. Au/Block (4/1) nanoparticle dispersions in organic solvents, on the other hand, were not stable and produced large gold clusters (50-100 nm). Cluster formation was attributed to the low grafting density of the block copolymer, which facilitates agglomeration. For Au/Block (12/1), along the same trend, only an insoluble product was isolated. Micelles in water were prepared by the slow addition of the dilute Au/Block solution in dimethylformamide into a large excess of water with vigorous stirring. Au/Block (1/1) and Au/Block (2/1) formed nanosized structures of 5-7 nm. TEM images of stained Au/Block (1/1) micelles, made in water, clearly showed the formation of core-shell structures. Au/Block (3/1) micelles, on the other hand, were not stable and large agglomerates a few microns in size were observed. The study focuses on the synthesis, characterization, and aggregation behavior of gold-loaded PEO-b-PCL block copolymer micelles, a potential system for drug delivery in conjunction with tissue and subcellular localization studies.

In close agreement with previous observations, superimposed surface maps indicate that the corpus callosum in Williams syndrome individuals is shorter and less curved. Moreover, we observed significantly thinner callosal regions in Williams syndrome individuals across the posterior surface, where group effects were less pronounced and spatially restricted in brain-size-adjusted data compared with native data. Circumscribed structural alterations in callosal morphology might be candidate anatomic substrates for the unique cognitive and behavioral profile associated with Williams syndrome.

Modulation of respiratory activity by locomotion in lampreys	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						respiratory pattern; rhythm generation; locomotor activity; brainstem	SOMATIC AFFERENT STIMULATION; RETICULOSPINAL NEURONS; LAMPETRA-FLUVIATILIS; NEURAL CONTROL; SPINAL-CORD; EXERCISE; HYPOTHALAMUS; CIRCULATION; PATTERN; COMMAND	In vertebrates, locomotion is associated with changes in respiratory activity, but the neural mechanisms by which this occurs remain unknown. We began examining this in lampreys using a semi-intact preparation of young adult Petromyzon marinus, in which respiratory and locomotor behaviors can be recorded simultaneously with the activity of the underlying neural control systems. Spontaneous fictive respiration was recorded with suction electrodes positioned over the glossopharyngeal or the rostral vagal motor nucleus. In this preparation, locomotor activity, characterized by symmetrical tail movements (electromyogram recordings), was evoked by mechanical stimulation of the skin. During locomotion, the mean respiratory frequency and the mean area of the motor bursts were significantly increased (81.6 +/- 28.6% and 62.8 +/- 25.4%, respectively; P < 0.05). The frequency returned to normal 92 +/- 51 s after the end of locomotion. There were fluctuations in the instantaneous respiratory and locomotor frequencies that were rhythmical but antiphasic for the two rhythmic activities. The changes in respiratory activity were also examined during bouts of locomotion occurring spontaneously, and it was found that a modification in respiratory activity preceded the onset of spontaneous locomotion by 3.5 +/- 2.6 s. This suggests that the early respiratory changes are anticipatory and are not caused by feedback generated by locomotion. The increase in respiratory frequency during locomotion induced by sensory stimulation persisted after removal of the mesencephalon. When both the mesencephalon and spinal cord were removed, resulting in the isolation of the rhombencephalon, changes in the respiratory activity were also present following skin stimulations that would have normally induced locomotion. Altogether, the results suggest that respiratory changes are programmed to adjust ventilation prior to motor activity, and that a central rhombencephalic mechanism is involved. (c) 2006 IBRO.

In the oculomotor system, signals specifying desired eye velocity are thought to be transformed into motor commands by an inverse dynamic model of the eye plant that is shared for all types of eye movements and implemented by a weighted combination of eye velocity and position signals. Neurons in the prepositus hypoglossi and adjacent medial vestibular nuclei (PH-BT neurons) were traditionally thought to encode the "eye position" component of this inverse model. However, not only are PH-BT responses inconsistent with this theoretical role, but compensatory eye movement responses to translation do not show evidence for processing by a common inverse dynamic model. Prompted by these discrepancies between theoretical notions and experimental observations, we reevaluated these concepts using multiple-frequency rotational and translational head movements. Compatible with the notion of acommoninverse model, we show that PH-BT responses are unique among all premotor cell types in bearing a consistent relationship to the motor output during eye movements driven by different sensory stimuli. However, because their responses are dynamically identical to those of motoneurons, PH-BT neurons do not simply represent an internal component of the inverse model, but rather its output. They encode and distribute an estimate of the motor command, a signal critical for accurate motor execution and learning.

Hypo-osmolar stress induces p75NTR expression by activating Sp1-dependent transcription	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						neurotrophin; injury; proNGF; proteosome; promoter; osmolarity	NF-KAPPA-B; NEUROTROPHIN RECEPTOR; SPINAL-CORD; RAT HEPATOCYTES; TRANSGENIC MICE; GENE; SP1; NEURONS; CELLS; MECHANISMS	Injury-induced expression of the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR) in the CNS facilitates neuronal apoptosis and prevents neuronal regrowth, but the mechanisms regulating p75NTR expression are poorly characterized. In this study, we showed that hypo-osmolarity induces p75NTR expression in primary neurons, and, using a comparative genomics approach, we identified conserved elements in the 25 kb upstream sequences of the rat, mouse, and human p75NTR genes. We found that only one of these, a proximal region rich in Sp1 sites, responds to changes in hypo-osmolarity. We then showed that Sp1 DNA binding activity is increased in cells exposed to hypo-osmolarity, established that hypo-osmolarity enhanced Sp1 binding to the endogenous p75NTR promoter, and showed that Sp1 is required for p75NTR expression induced by hypo-osmolarity. We examined how Sp1 is regulated to effect these changes and established that Sp1 turnover is strongly inhibited by hypo-osmolarity. We propose that stress-induced Sp1 accumulation that results from reductions in Sp1 turnover rate contributes to injury-induced gene expression.

Methods: We developed a multiplex real-time reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR assay to quantify SMN transcripts in preclinical blood samples from 42 patients with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) drawn for three time points per patient; most blood samples were shipped to a centralized laboratory. Results: We obtained a sufficient amount (9.7 +/- 5.6 mu g) of good-quality total RNA, and RNAs were stable for up to a 3-year interval. This allowed RNA samples collected during a 9- to 12-month period to be analyzed in a single run, thus minimizing interexperimental variability. SMN expression was stable over time; intersample variability for baseline measures, collected during a 17-month interval, was less than 15% for 38 of 42 SMA patients analyzed. This variability was well below the 1.95-fold increase in full-length SMN (flSMN) transcripts detected in SMA fibroblasts treated with 10 mM valproic acid. Conclusion: Real-time quantification of SMN messenger RNA expression may be a biomarker that is amenable to multicenter SMA clinical trials.

Methylmercury is a potent toxin, bioaccumulated an concentrated through the aquatic food chain, placing at risk people, throughout the globe and across the socioeconomic spectrum, who consume predatory fish or for whom fish is a dietary mainstay. Methylmercury developmental neurotoxicity has constituted the basis for risk assessments and public health policies. Despite gaps in our knowledge on new bioindicators of exposure, factors that influence MeHg uptake and toxicity, toxicokinetics, neurologic and cardiovascular effects in adult populations, and the nutritional benefits and risks from the large number of marine and freshwater fish and fish-eating species, the panel concluded that to preserve human health, all efforts need to be made to reduce and eliminate sources of exposure.

Convergent validity of this test was assessed by comparing GMLT scores to Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT) and Tower of Toronto (TOT) scores. In the full sample, all GMLT measures correlated strongly with both PASAT and TOT scores (r's = 0.53 to 0.73). GMLT measures most sensitive to detecting between-group differences were the Timed Chase Test (TCT), legal errors, and perseverative errors (Cohen's d's = 3.81, 2.40, and 2.40, respectively). Scores on the visuornotor processing speed subtest of the GMLT attenuated the relationship between age group and maze efficiency index scores, but not perseverative and "rule-break" errors. These results suggest that normal aging is associated with impaired performance on a novel computerized measure of spatial leaming efficiency and error monitoring, and that processing speed attenuates the relationship between age and spatial learning efficiency.

Three families with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia with evidence of linkage to chromosome 9p	ARCHIVES OF NEUROLOGY			English	Article							MUTATIONS; PROTEIN; DISEASE; LOCUS; DEATH; GENE; ALS	Background: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) are neurodegenerative disorders with adult onset that generally progress rapidly after the onset of symptoms. The 2 conditions are independent, but they also overlap in a significant proportion of families, including 2 families in which the disorders are reported to be linked to chromosome 9p. A locus was established between the markers D9S2154 and D9S1791 by comparing haplotypes between these families. Objective: To determine whether additional families have ALS and FTD linked to chromosome 9p. Methods: Families were identified in Canada and France, and genotyping was performed using sequence tagged site markers around the ALS-FTD candidate interval. Results: Three new families with mapping to the chromosome 9p ALS-FTD locus were identified. Analysis of the largest family shows a peak 2-point logarithm of odds (LOD) score of 2.81 and a multipoint LOD score of 3.01. The particular candidate interval delineated by this family spans 27.1 centimorgans (cM) between markers D9S157 and D9S1805. This reduces the centromeric boundary of the candidate interval compared with previously reported values, shortening the locus to 8.1 cM (8.0 megabase pairs). A maximum multipoint LOD score of 7.22 is obtained when the 3 families are combined. Conclusions: The identification of new families enables reduction of the ALS-FTD candidate region located on chromosome 9p. The clinical features observed in these families help characterize the profiles of ALS and FTD with linkage to chromosome 9p-linked families.

Strategic subcortical hyperintensities in cholinergic pathways and executive function decline in treated Alzheimer patients	ARCHIVES OF NEUROLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	2nd Congress of the International-Society-for-Vascular-Behavioral-and-Cognitive-Disorders (Vas-Cog 2005)	JUL, 2005	Florence, ITALY	Int Soc Vasc Behav & Cognit Disorders			WHITE-MATTER CHANGES; VASCULAR DEMENTIA; CHOLINESTERASE-INHIBITORS; RISK-FACTORS; RATING-SCALE; DISEASE; LESIONS; BRAIN; EFFICACY; DONEPEZIL	Objective: To investigate changes in cognition, function, and behavior after 1 year in patients with Alzheimer disease being treated with cholinesterase inhibitors, in relation to the presence or absence of subcortical hyperintensities involving the cholinergic pathways. Design: One-year prospective cohort study. Setting: Memory Clinic, Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, University of Toronto. Patients: Ninety patients with possible/probable Alzheimer disease who were being treated with cholinesterase inhibitors at baseline. Interventions: Yearly standardized neuropsychological testing and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The Cholinergic Pathways Hyperintensities Scale (CHIPS) was applied to baseline MRIs to rate the severity of subcortical hyperintensities in cholinergic pathways. The consensus-derived Age-Related White Matter Changes (ARWMC) Rating Scale was used as a general measure of white matter disease burden. Main Outcome Measures: Tests of global cognition, function, and behavior and specific cognitive and functional domains. Results: Patients in the low CHIPS group were equivalent to those in the high CHIPS group with regard to baseline demographic characteristics, cognitive severity, and vascular risk factors. After covarying age and education, no differences were found after 1 year in overall cognition, function, and behavior or on memory, language, and visuo-spatial tasks. Patients in the high CHIPS group showed improvement on executive function and working memory tasks compared with those in the low CHIPS group. For the ARWMC scale, groups with and without white matter abnormalities were equivalent on baseline demographics and in cognitive, functional, and behavioral outcomes. Conclusion: Cerebrovascular compromise of the cholinergic pathways may be a factor that contributes more selectively than does total white matter lesion burden to response to cholinergic therapy in Alzheimer disease, particularly on frontal/executive tasks.

In the recent study intriguing sex differences were observed in the cerebral function associated with the experience of sadness in schizophrenia patients. The aim of the present study was to explore this phenomenon during exposure to aversive stimuli. Method: Fifteen men and 10 women with the DSM-IV diagnosis of schizophrenia underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (WRI) while viewing alternating blocks of negative and neutral pictures. Data were analysed using random-effects model within statistical parametric mapping (SPM99) software. Results: Processing of negative stimuli evoked significantly greater activations in men in the thalamus, cerebellum, temporal, occipital and posterior cingulate cortex, while women exhibited greater activations in the left middle frontal gyrus. Conclusions: The sex differences in the cerebral activations in schizophrenia patients deviate from what has been observed in the general population during exposure and experience of negative affect. As such the present study supports and extends the authors' preliminary observation of the anomalous sexual dimorphism in schizophrenia at the functional neuroanatomical level, suggesting potential masculinization of female subjects and feminization of male subjects with schizophrenia.

OPMD is caused by a small expansion of a short polyalanine tract in the poly (A) binding protein nuclear 1 protein (PABPN1). The mechanism by which the polyalanine expansion mutation in PABPN1 causes disease is unclear. PABPN1 is a nuclear multifunctional protein which is involved in pre-mRNA polyadenylation, transcription regulation, and mRNA nucleocytoplasmic transport. The distinct pathological hallmark of OPMD is the presence of filamentous intranuclear inclusions (INIs) in patient's skeletal muscle cells. The exact relationship between mutant PABPN1 intranuclear aggregates and pathology is not clear. OPMD is a unique disease sharing common pathogenic features with other polyalanine disorders, as well as with polyglutamine and dystrophic disorders. This chapter aims to review the rapidly growing body of knowledge concerning OPMD. First, we outline the background of OPMD. Second, we compare OPMD with other trinucleotide repeat disorders. Third, we discuss the recent advances in the understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying OPMD pathogenesis. Finally, we review recent therapeutic strategies for OPMD. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Results of the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute ALL Consortium Protocol 95-01 for children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia	BLOOD			English	Article							PEDIATRIC-ONCOLOGY-GROUP; MINIMAL RESIDUAL DISEASE; ESCHERICHIA-COLI-ASPARAGINASE; CRANIAL RADIATION-THERAPY; ADVANCED BREAST-CANCER; LONG-TERM SURVIVORS; NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL PERFORMANCE; DOXORUBICIN THERAPY; RISK PATIENTS; CNS RELAPSE	The Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI) Childhood ALL Consortium Protocol 95-01 was designed to minimize therapy-related morbidity for children with newly diagnosed ALL without compromising efficacy. Patients participated in randomized comparisons of (1) doxorubicin given with or without dexrazoxane, a cardioprotectant (high-risk patients), (2) intensive intrathecal chemotherapy and cranial radiation (standard-risk patients), and (3) Erwinia and Escherichia coli asparaginase (all patients). Between 1996 and 2000, 491 patients (aged 0-18 years) were enrolled (272 standard risk and 219 high risk). With a median of 5.7 years of followup, the estimated 5-year event-free survival (EFS) for all patients was 82% +/- 2%. Dexrazoxane did not have a significant impact on the 5-year EFS of high-risk patients (P =.99), and there was no significant difference in outcome of standard-risk patients based on type of central nervous system (CNS) treatment (P =.26). Compared with E coli asparaginase, Erwinia asparaginase was associated with a lower incidence of toxicity (10% versus 24%), but also an inferior 5-year EFS (78% +/- 4% versus 89% +/- 3%, P =.01). We conclude that (1) dexrazoxane does not interfere with the antileukemic effect of doxorubicin, (2) intensive intrathecal chemotherapy is as effective as cranial radiation in preventing CNS relapse in standard-risk patients, and (3) once-weekly Erwinia is less toxic than E coli asparaginase, but also less efficacious.

Molecular characterization of the effects of Y-27632	CELL MOTILITY AND THE CYTOSKELETON			English	Article						Y-27632; rho kinases; actin and microtubule rearrangement; neurite outgrowth	MYOSIN LIGHT-CHAIN; RHO-ASSOCIATED KINASE; VENTRAL BODY-WALL; SMOOTH-MUSCLE; NEURITE OUTGROWTH; PROTEIN-KINASE; INHIBITOR Y-27632; 3T3 FIBROBLASTS; CELL-MIGRATION; ROCK-I	Many key cellular functions, such as cell motility and cellular differentiation are mediated by Rho-associated protein kinases (ROCKs). Numerous studies have been conducted to examine the ROCK signal transduction pathways involved in these motile and contractile events with the aid of pharmacological inhibitors such as Y-27632. However the molecular mechanism of action of Y-27632 has not been fully defined. To assess the relative contribution of these Rho effectors to the effects of Y-27632, we compared the cytoskeletal phenotype, wound healing and neurite outgrowth in cells treated with Y-27632 or subjected to knockdown with ROCK-I, ROCK-II or PRK-2-specific siRNAs. Reduction of ROCK-I enhances the formation of thin actin-rich membrane extensions, a phenotype that closely resembles the effect of Y-27632. Knockdown of ROCK-II or PRK-2, leads to the formation of disc-like extenstions and thick actin bundles, respectively. The effect of ROCK-I knockdown also mimicked the effect of Y-27632 on wound closer rates. ROCK-I knockdown and Y-27632 enhanced wound closure rates, while ROCK-II and PRK-2 were not appreciably different from control cells. In neurite outgrowth assays, knockdown of ROCK-I, ROCK-II or PRK-2 enhances neurite lengths, however no individual knockdown stimulated neurite outgrowth as robustly as Y-27632. We conclude that several kinases contribute to the global effect of Y-27632 on cellular responses.

The simultaneous activation of the olfactory and the trigeminal system leads to an interaction in the brain. Therefore, assessment of the trigeminal impact of odorants may be difficult in subjects with a normal sense of smell. To obtain a deeper insight into both, mechanisms of changes in trigeminal sensitivity in anosmic patients and interactions between the olfactory/trigeminal systems in healthy subjects, 21 patients with isolated congenital anosmia (ICA) were investigated in this series of explorative, hypothesis-generating experiments and compared with 35 healthy controls. Trigeminal sensitivity was measured by psychophysical (lateralization task, intensity ratings) and electrophysiological (trigeminal event-related potential, negative mucosal potential) means. ICA patients were found to have higher peripheral activation than controls. On central levels, however, similar responsiveness to trigeminal stimuli was found in ICA patients when compared with healthy subjects. The results of the study are discussed by proposing a model of mixed sensory adaptation/compensation in the interactions between olfactory and the trigeminal system.

The present study used repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to further examine the functional role of this structure in the successful use of the PSVA. Moreover, we investigated which auditory parameter used in the prosthesis (pitch, intensity, or spatial location) might contribute to this occipital activation. Results revealed that rTMS applied to right dorsal extrastriate cortex in EB subjects interferes with both the PSVA use and the auditory spatial location task but not with pitch and intensity discriminations. By contrast, rTMS targeting the same cortical areas in sighted subjects did not affect performance on any auditory tasks. Early visual deprivation thus leads to functional cerebral cross-modal reorganization in the processing of auditory information and auditory-to-visual sensory substitution. The findings also point to the specific involvement of the dorsal visual stream for auditory spatial processing in blind subjects. Moreover, this suggests that sensory substitution prostheses can be developed using these additional neural resources to perform tasks that partially compensate for the loss of vision.

Neural activity elicited by left- and right-ear stimulation was measured simultaneously in the cochlear nuclei, inferior colliculi (ICs), medial geniculate bodies (MGBs), and auditory cortices (ACs) in 2 functional magnetic resonance imaging experiments. In experiment 1, pulsed noise was presented monaurally to either ear, or binaurally, simulating a moving sound source. In experiment 2, only monaural sounds were presented. The results show a modulation of the neural responses to monaural sounds by the presence of binaural sounds at a time scale of tens of seconds: In the absence of binaural stimulation, the left and right ICs, MGBs, and ACs responded stronger to stimulation of the contralateral ear. When blocks of binaural stimuli were interspersed in the sound sequence, the contralateral preference vanished in those structures in the right hemisphere. The resulting hemispheric asymmetry was similar to the asymmetry demonstrated for spatial sound processing. Taken together, the data demonstrate that functional asymmetries in auditory processing are modulated by context. The observed long time constant suggests that this effect results from a "top-down" mechanism.

Valerie			Quetiapine augmentation of treatment-resistant depression: a comparison with lithium	CURRENT MEDICAL RESEARCH AND OPINION			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	157th Annual Meeting of the American-Psychiatric-Association	MAY 01-06, 2004	New York, NY	Amer Psychiat Assoc		quetiapine; treatment-resistant depression; lithium; augmentation; atypical antipsychotic	INTERNATIONAL NEUROPSYCHIATRIC INTERVIEW; SEROTONIN REUPTAKE INHIBITORS; NEUROTROPHIC FACTOR; CLINICAL-PRACTICE; MAJOR DEPRESSION; MOOD DISORDERS; DSM-IV; BRAIN; DRUGS; ANTIDEPRESSANTS	Objective: The prevalence of and morbidity associated with treatment-resistant depression has motivated the exploration of treatment alternatives. In this study, quetiapine was compared with lithium in the augmentation of treatment-resistant depression. Research design and methods: Open-label, comparative study in 20 patients with major depression who had failed to respond after 4 weeks of treatment with an antidepressant at the maximal recommended dose. Patients were randomised to either lithium or quetiapine in addition to the maximally dosed antidepressant and any other concurrent medications. Lithium was initiated at 600 mg/day; quetiapine was titrated to 400 mg by day 7. Results: Depression, measured by the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D), significantly improved from baseline in both quetiapine (F-1,F-90 = 25.11, p < 0.0001) and lithium (F-1,F-90 = 34.54, p < 0.0001). The difference in improvement between the two groups began at day 14 and was seen at all timepoints thereafter (p < 0.05), with the quetiapine group showing greater improvement than the lithium group. In the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) analysis, the difference between the quetiapine and lithium group was significant from day 28 onwards (p < 0.05), with subjects improving more in the quetiapine group than the lithium group. The treatment by week interaction showed a significant difference overall between the two groups (p < 0.0001). The severity of psychomotor retardation showed a significant decrease in the Widlocher Psychomotor Retardation Scale scores in the quetiapine (p < 0.0001) and lithium (p < 0.0001) groups. Conclusions: In this pilot study, quetiapine was an effective augmenting agent in treatment-resistant depression.

Recent findings High rates of occupational asthma and inhalation accidents were found in workers in crafts and related occupations in the manufacturing industries, and in plant and machine operatives; cleaners and construction workers may also be at risk. Further data support a role for GD4(+) T cells in low-molecular-weight agent-induced asthma, such as with isocyanates, and neurogenic mechanisms may also be involved. The use of noninvasive measures of airway inflammation in the diagnosis and management of occupational asthma such as sputum eosinophils monitoring is promising, although this is less obvious for exhaled nitric oxide. Finally, the persistence of troublesome asthma even after withdrawal from relevant exposure has been re-emphasized and surveillance programs have been proposed. Summary Further data have been gathered on the prevalence of occupational asthma in various working populations, its mechanisms of development; the contribution of noninvasive measures of airway inflammation in the diagnosis and management of this condition, and its management and prevention.

The glycosyltransferase Fringe promotes Delta-Notch signaling between neurons and glia, and is required for subtype-specific glial gene expression	DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Drosophila; glia; neuron; fringe; notch; delta; prospero; axon	CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; DROSOPHILA WING DEVELOPMENT; TRANSMEMBRANE PROTEIN; AXON GUIDANCE; CELL FATE; ASYMMETRIC DIVISIONS; LONGITUDINAL GLIA; UBIQUITIN LIGASE; PROGENITOR CELLS; SERRATE ENCODES	The development, organization and function of central nervous systems depend on interactions between neurons and glial cells. However, the molecular signals that regulate neuron-glial communication remain elusive. In the ventral nerve cord of Drosophila, the close association of the longitudinal glia (LG) with the neuropil provides an excellent opportunity to identify and characterize neuron-glial signals in vivo. We have found that the activity and restricted expression of the glycosyltransferase Fringe (Fng) renders a subset of LG sensitive to activation of signaling through the Notch (N) receptor. This is the first report showing that modulation of N signaling by Fng is important for central nervous system development in any organism. In each hemisegment of the nerve cord the transcription factor Prospero (Pros) is selectively expressed in the six most anterior LG. Pros expression is specifically reduced in fng mutants, and is blocked by antagonism of the N pathway. The N ligand Delta (Dl), which is expressed by a subset of neurons, cooperates with Fng for N signaling in the anterior LG, leading to subtype-specific expression of Pros. Furthermore, ectopic Pros expression in posterior LG can be triggered by Fng, and by Dl derived from neurons but not glia. This effect can be mimicked by direct activation of the N pathway within glia. Our genetic studies suggest that Fng sensitizes N on glia to axon-derived Dl and that enhanced neuron-glial communication through this ligand-receptor pair is required for the proper molecular diversity of glial cell subtypes in the developing nervous system.

J	Dernovici, S; Starc, T; Dent, JA; Ribeiro, P				Dernovici, Serge; Starc, Tanja; Dent, Joseph A.; Ribeiro, Paula			The serotonin receptor SER-1 (5HT2ce) contributes to the regulation of locomotion in Caenorhabditis elegans	DEVELOPMENTAL NEUROBIOLOGY			English	Article						serotonin; SER-1; MOD-1; Caenorhabditis elegans; locomotion; reversals; food-induced slowing	LIM HOMEOBOX GENE; C-ELEGANS; 5-HT7-LIKE RECEPTOR; NERVOUS-SYSTEM; MOTOR-NEURON; BEHAVIOR; EXPRESSION; DOPAMINE; ENVIRONMENT; ACTIVATION	Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine: 5HT) is an important neuroactive substance in the model roundworm, Caenorhabditis elegans. Aside from having effects in feeding and egg-laying, 5HT inhibits motility and also modulates several locomotory behaviors, notably food-induced slowing and foraging. Recent evidence showed that a serotonergic 5HT2-like receptor named SER-1 (also known as 5HT2ce) was responsible for the effect of 5HT on egg-laying. Here we confirm this observation and show that SER-1 also plays an important role in locomotion. A mutant lacking SER-1 was found to be highly resistant to exogenous 5HT in the absence of food and this resistant phenotype was rescued by reintroducing the SER-1 gene in a mutant background. Pharmacological studies showed that the same antagonists that blocked the activity of recombinant SER-1 in vitro also inhibited the effect of 5HT on motility, suggesting the same receptor was responsible for both effects. When tested for locomotory behaviors, the SER-1 mutant was found to be moderately defective in food-induced slowing. In addition, the mutant changed direction more frequently than the wildtype when searching for food, suggesting that SER-1 may play a role in navigational control during foraging. Both these effects required the presence of MOD-1, a 5HT gated chloride channel, and the results indicate that SER-1 and MOD-1 modulate these behaviors through a common pathway. On the basis of expression analysis of a ser-1::GFP translational fusion, SER-1 is prominently located in central, integrating neurons of the head ganglia (RIA and RIC) but not the body wall musculature. The evidence suggests that SER-1 controls locomotion through indirect modulation of neuromuscular circuits and has effects both on speed and direction of movement. (c) 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

LTM is an established technique in use both in a hospital setting and, increasingly, in an ambulatory and more recently in a community-based setting. There has been sufficient evidence to substantiate the claim that LTM is of crucial importance in documenting electroclinical correlations both in epilepsy and in paroxysmally occurring behavioral changes often mistaken for epilepsy. Internationally recognized neurophysiological equipment standards, data acquisition and data transfer protocols and widely accepted safety standards have made widespread access to LTM facilities in epilepsy possible. Recommendations on efficient and effective use of resources as well as regarding training and competencies for personnel involved in LTM in epilepsy have been formulated. The DMC Neurophysiology Subcommittee of the ILAE recommends use of hospital-based LTM in the documentation of seizures including its application for assessing seizure type and frequency, in the evaluation of status epilepticus, in noninvasive and invasive video/EEG investigations for epilepsy surgery and for the differential diagnosis between epilepsy and paroxysmally occurring nonepileptic conditions, in children and in adults. Ambulatory outpatient and community-based LTM may be used as a substitute for inpatient LTM in cases where the latter is not cost-effective or feasible or when activation procedures aimed at increasing seizure yield are not indicated. However, outpatient ambulatory monitoring may be less informative than is inpatient monitoring in some cases because: (1) reduction of medication to provoke seizures may not be safe as an outpatient; (2) faulty electrode contacts cannot quickly be noticed and repaired; (3) the patient may move out of video surveillance; and (4) duration of ambulatory monitoring can be limited by technical constraints.

Neuropsychological and neuroimaging studies suggest that the retrosplenial and hippocampal brain regions are involved in topographical orientation. We combined functional magnetic resonance imaging with a virtual-reality paradigm to investigate the functional interaction of the hippocampus and retrosplenial cortex during the formation and utilization of cognitive maps by human subjects. We found that the anterior hippocampus is involved during the formation of the cognitive map, while the posterior hippocampus is involved when using it. In conjunction with the hippocampus, the retrosplenial cortex was active during both the formation and the use of the cognitive map. In accordance with earlier studies in non-human animals, these findings suggest that, while navigating within the environment, the retrosplenial cortex complements the hippocampal contribution to topographical orientation by updating the individual's location as the frame of reference changes.

In this study we explored whether AT2R is expressed and functionally active on peripheral resistance arteries of hypertensive diabetic patients treated for 1 year with either the angiotensin receptor blocker valsartan or the beta-blocker atenolol. Twenty-six hypertensive type 2 diabetic patients treated with oral hypoglycemic and antihypertensive agents (not receiving angiotensin receptor blockers or beta-blockers) were randomly assigned to double-blind treatment for 1 year with valsartan or atenolol once daily added to their previous therapy in a clinical trial that we reported recently and compared with 10 normal subjects. Resistance arteries dissected from gluteal subcutaneous tissues were assessed on a pressurized myograph. Vasomotor response curves to angiotensin II (1 nmol/L to 1 mu mol/L) were performed on norepinephrine precontracted vessels in the presence of valsartan (10 mu mol/L) with or without the AT(2)R inhibitor PD123319 (1 mu mol/ L). AT(2)R expression was evaluated by confocal microscopy. After 1 year of treatment, systolic and diastolic blood pressure was controlled and comparable in the valsartan and atenolol groups. Angiotensin II evoked a significant vasodilatory response only on resistance arteries from patients treated with valsartan, effect blocked by PD123319. AT(2)R expression was 4-fold higher in small arteries of valsartan-treated patients. In conclusion, AT(2)Rs are upregulated and contribute to angiotensin II-induced vasodilation in resistance arteries of hypertensive diabetic patients treated with angiotensin type 1 receptor blockers and may mediate, in part, vascular actions of these drugs in high cardiovascular risk patients.

Design: Meta-analysis. Setting: A search of the National Library of Medicine of the United States PUBMED from 1966 up to June 11, 2005, with the following key words: "carotid surgery or endarterectomy and regional anesthesia." Measurements and Main Results: Forty-eight studies (14 prospective and 34 retrospective) were analyzed. The optimal information size was achieved only when all studies were analyzed together (prospective and retrospective). Regional anesthesia reduced the rate of any new neurologic impairment (odds ratio = 0.60; 95% confidence interval, 0.48-0.75; p < 0.00001), stroke (0.54 [0.43-0.681, p < 0.00001), stroke and/or death (0.62 [0.49-0.781, p < 0.0001), death (0.65 [0.48-0.87], p = 0.004), and myocardial infarction (0.50 [0.360.701, to < 0.0001). Conclusion: The number of patients included in randomized controlled trials or even in prospective studies is too low to allow any conclusions on the differences in outcome between the 2 anesthetic techniques. Better outcomes are suggested when results from retrospective studies are added. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The difficulty of assesing the contribution of the mPFC to encoding based on previous neuroimaging studies partly arises from the use of several types of stimuli, such as emotional or social ones. These different types of stimulus content could differently modulate mPFC activity during memory formation and thus partly explain the variable contribution of this region to encoding. Using emotional/neutral and social/nonsocial pictures, we conducted an event-related functional magnetic resonance image study using a subsequent memory paradigm as the main analytical strategy. We observed that the brain activity in the dorsal and orbital mPFC is significantly and specifically predictive of the successful encoding of emotional compared with neutral pictures. The modulation of the mPFC by social information in a memory encoding context could be associated with the iniation of self-referential processes whose contribution is to enhance memory formation.

As the NH2 domain on its own is not antiapoptotic, it has been postulated that both domains of R1 or part(s) of them could be necessary for this function. Here, N- and C-terminal deletions were introduced in HSV-2 R1 to map the domain(s) involved in its antiapoptotic potential. The results showed that, whereas most of the NH2 domain including part of the recently described putative a-crystallin domain is dispensable for antiapoptotic activity, it is the integrity of the structured RR domain that is required for protection. As the alpha-crystallin domain appears to play an important role in protein folding and oligomerization, the N-terminal boundary of the antiapoptotic domain could not be defined precisely. In addition, this study provided evidence that overexpression of HSV-2 R2 at levels up to 30-fold more than HSV-2 R1 did not decrease protection from tumour necrosis factor alpha, indicating that the R1 surface where R2 binds is not involved in antiapoptotic activity. Importantly, this result suggests that the co-expression of both RR subunits during the lytic cycle should not affect protection from this cytokine.

The attempt to resolve these discrepancies led to the formulation of the Critical Period Hypothesis which holds that oestrogen has maximal protective benefits on cognition in women when it is initiated closely in time to a natural or surgical menopause but not when treatment is begun decades after the menopause. This article reviews the evidence from basic neuroendocrinology, from animal behavioural studies and from human studies that supports the critical period hypothesis. In view of the promise of this hypothesis and its considerable clinical implications, a direct test of its validity is warranted.

Visual-vestibular interaction hypothesis for the control of orienting gaze shifts by brain stem omnipause neurons	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article							PONTINE RETICULAR-FORMATION; EYE-HEAD COORDINATION; INHIBITORY BURST NEURONS; MONKEY SUPERIOR COLLICULUS; SYSTEM-IDENTIFICATION TECHNIQUES; VESTIBULOOCULAR REFLEX; PAUSE NEURONS; ALERT CAT; ELECTRICAL-STIMULATION; MOVEMENT DYNAMICS	Models of combined eye-head gaze shifts all aim to realistically simulate behaviorally observed movement dynamics. One of the most problematic features of such models is their inability to determine when a saccadic gaze shift should be initiated and when it should be ended. This is commonly referred to as the switching mechanism mediated by omni-directional pause neurons ( OPNs) in the brain stem. Proposed switching strategies implemented in existing gaze control models all rely on a sensory error between instantaneous gaze position and the spatial target. Accordingly, gaze saccades are initiated after presentation of an eccentric visual target and subsequently terminated when an internal estimate of gaze position becomes nearly equal to that of the target. Based on behavioral observations, we demonstrate that such a switching mechanism is insufficient and is unable to explain certain types of movements. We propose an improved hypothesis for how the OPNs control gaze shifts based on a visual-vestibular interaction of signals known to be carried on anatomical projections to the OPN area. The approach is justified by the analysis of recorded gaze shifts interrupted by a head brake in animal subjects and is demonstrated by implementing the switching mechanism in an anatomically based gaze control model. Simulated performance reveals that a weighted sum of three signals: gaze motor error, head velocity, and eye velocity, hypothesized as inputs to OPNs, successfully reproduces diverse behaviorally observed eye-head movements that no other existing model can account for.

The onset of left- or rightward motion in an otherwise continuous sound was found to elicit a large response, which appeared to arise from higher-level nonprimary auditory areas. This motion onset response was strongly lateralized to the hemisphere contralateral to the direction of motion. The response latencies suggest that the ipsilateral response to the leftward motion was produced by indirect callosal projections from the opposite hemisphere, whereas the ipsilateral response to the rightward motion seemed to receive contributions from direct thalamocortical projections. These results suggest an asymmetry in the reliance on inter-hemispheric projections between the left and right auditory cortices for auditory spatial processing.

To test this claim, we asked occasional singers (n=62) to sing a well-known song in both the laboratory and in a natural setting (experiment 1). Sung performances were judged by peers for proficiency, analyzed for pitch and time accuracy with an acoustic-based method, and compared to professional singing. The peer ratings for the proficiency of occasional singers were normally distributed. Only a minority of the occasional singers made numerous pitch errors. The variance in singing proficiency was largely due to tempo differences. Occasional singers tended to sing at a faster tempo and with more pitch and time errors relative to professional singers. In experiment 2 15 nonmusicians from experiment 1 sang the same song at a slow tempo. In this condition, most of the occasional singers sang as accurately as the professional singers. Thus, singing appears to be a universal human trait. However, two of the occasional singers maintained a high rate of pitch errors at the slower tempo. This poor performance was not due to impaired pitch perception, thus suggesting the existence of a purely vocal form of tone deafness. (c) 2007 Acoustical Society of America.

HTLV-2 is highly related to HTLV-1 at the genetic level and shares a high degree of sequence homology, but infection with HTLV-2 is relatively nonpathogenic compared to HTLV-1. Although the pathogenesis of HAM/TSP remains to be fully elucidated, previous evidence suggests that elevated levels of the proinflammatory cytokines in the CNS are associated with neuropathogenesis. We demonstrate that HTLV-1 infection in astrogliomas results in a robust induction of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), IL-1 alpha, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha), TNF-beta, and IL-6 expression. HTLV encodes for a viral transcriptional transactivator protein named Tax that also induces the transcription of cellular genes. To investigate and compare the effects of Tax1 and Tax2 expression on the dysregulation of proinflammatory cytokines, lentivirus vectors were used to transduce primary human astrocytomas and oligodendrogliomas. The expression of Tax1 in primary human astrocytomas and oligodendrogliomas resulted in significantly higher levels of proinflammatory cytokine gene expression compared to Tax2. Notably, Tax1 expression uniquely sensitized primary human astrocytomas to apoptosis. A Tax2/Tax1 chimera encoding the C-terminal 53 amino acids of the Tax1 fused to the Tax2 gene (Tax(221)) demonstrated a phenotype that resembled Tax1, with respect to proinflammatory cytokine gene expression and sensitization to apoptosis. The patterns of differential cytokine induction and sensitization to apoptosis displayed by Tax1 and Tax2 may reflect differences relating to the heightened neuropathogenicity associated with HTLV-1 infection and the development of HAM/TSP.

Behavioral studies hove yielded a large amount of data addressing this issue. Generally speaking, these data show that there are some interactions between the semantic processing of pictures and words. However, behavioral methods can provide only limited insight into certain findings. Fortunately, Event-Related Potential (ERP) provides on-line cues about the temporal nature of cognitive processes and contributes to the exploration of their neural substrates. ERPs have been used in order to better understand semantic processing of words and pictures. The main objective of this article is to offer an overview of the electrophysiologic bases of semantic processing of words and pictures. Studies presented in this article showed that the processing of words is associated with an N400 component, whereas pictures elicited both N300 and N400 components. Topographical analysis of the N400 distribution over the scalp is compatible with the idea that both image-mediated concrete words and pictures access an amodal semantic system. However, given the distinctive N300 patterns, observed only during picture processing, it appears that picture and word processing rely upon distinct neuronal networks, even if they end up activating more or less similar semantic representations.

Lysine acetylation has been shown to modulate MEF2 function, but it is not so clear which deacetylase(s) is involved. We report here that treatment of HEK293 cells with trichostatin A or nicotinamide upregulated MEF2D acetylation, suggesting that different deacetylases catalyze the deacetylation. Related to the trichostatin A sensitivity, histone deacetylase 4 (HDAC4) and HDAC5, two known partners of MEF2, exhibited little deacetylase activity towards MEF2D. In contrast, HDAC3 efficiently deacetylated MEF2D in vitro and in vivo. This was specific, since HDAC1, HDAC2, and HDAC8 failed to do so. While HDAC4, HDAC5, HDAC7, and HDAC9 are known to recognize primarily the MEF2-specific domain, we found that HDAC3 interacts directly with the MADS box. In addition, HDAC3 associated with the acetyltransferases p300 and p300/CBP-associated factor (PCAF) to reverse autoacetylation. Furthermore, the nuclear receptor corepressor SMRT (silencing mediator of retinoid acid and thyroid hormone receptor) stimulated the deacetylase activity of HDAC3 towards MEF2 and PCAF. Supporting the physical interaction and deacetylase activity, HDAC3 repressed MEF2-dependent transcription and inhibited myogenesis. These results reveal an unexpected role for HDAC3 and suggest a novel pathway through which MEF2 activity is controlled in vivo.

Disorders affecting methylcobalamin metabolism cause megaloblastic anemia, which may be accompanied by leukopenia and thrombocytopenia, and a variety of neurological problems. Disorders affecting adenosylcobalamin cause metbylmalonic acidemia and metabolic acidosis. Previous studies have shown that cobalamin binds to two enzymes in humans: methylmalonyl-CoA mutase in mitochondria and methionine synthase in the cytosol. In this study, cobalamin binding patterns were analyzed in crude mitochondrial fractions obtained from both control and patient fibroblasts that had been incubated with [Co-57]cyanocobalamin. Crude mitochondrial fractions from control fibroblasts confirmed that the majority of [Co-57]Cbl eluted with methylmalonyl-CoA mutase. However, in six of the nine disorders, at least one previously unidentified mitochondrial cobalamin binding protein was observed to bind [Co-57]Cbl. The proportion of [Co-57] Cbl that binds, is increased compared to controls when a deficiency in either adenosylcobalamin synthesis or utilization prevents binding to methylmalonyl-CoA mutase. Furthermore, unique cobalamin binding profiles emerged demonstrating how known mutations in these patients affect cobalamin binding to as yet unidentified proteins. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Neuroimaging research reports individual differences in age-related activation, thereby educing speculation that some degree of plasticity may remain throughout life. We conducted a randomized longitudinal dual-task training study to investigate if performance improvements (a) change the magnitude or pattern of fMRI activation, thereby suggesting some plasticity retention in old age and (b) result in a reduction in asymmetry and an increase in age differences in fMRI activation as a compensatory model of performance-related activation predicts. Performance improvements were correlated with an increase in hemispheric asymmetry and a reduction in age differences in ventral and dorsal prefrontal activation. These results provide evidence for plasticity in old age and are discussed in relation to an alternative argument for the role of reduced asymmetry in performance improvements. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

In order to determine how translation initiation is regulated during neuroplasticity we engineered mutant C57Bl/6J mice that lack the translation repressor eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein 2 (4E-BP2) and have previously demonstrated that 4E-BP2 plays a critical role in hippocampus-dependent synaptic plasticity and memory. Herein, we examined the 4E-BP2 knockout mice in a battery of paradigms to address motor activity and motor skill learning, anxiety and social dominance behaviors, working memory and conditioned taste aversion. We found that the 4E-BP2 knockout mice demonstrated altered activity in the rotating rod test, light/dark exploration test, spontaneous alternation T-maze and conditioned taste aversion test. The information gained from these studies builds a solid foundation for future studies on the specific role of 4E-BP2 in various types of behavior, and for a broader, more detailed examination of the mechanisms of translational control in the brain.

A careful study of the molecules operating at the synapse indicates that their roles are more multifarious than once imagined.

The ototoxicity associated with H2O2 has been controversial. STUDY DESIGN: We designed an experiment to test if H2O2 damages the cochlear hair cells using a Chinchilla laniger animal model. METHODS: Nine chinchillas (18 ears) were included in this study. Each animal was used as its own control. Following the insertion of ventilation tubes in both ears and baseline recordings of the auditory brain stem responses (ABR), we instilled 2 ml of 3 percent H2O2 into their right external auditory canals (experimental ears). H2O2 was left in the external auditory canal for a total of 5 minutes and then was drained. We instilled a normal saline control solution in their left ears (control ears) in a similar fashion. ABR recordings were performed 1 day after the last instillation of H2O2 and 5 days later. RESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference in the ABR thresholds of the experimental and control ears. CONCLUSION: H2O2 did not appear to cause ototoxicity in chinchilla ears with tympanostomy tubes exposed to H2O2 instillation using a standard clinical protocol.

Pain is an unpleasant and intrusive sensation, warning of actual or potential tissue damage. Over the last fifteen years, functional cerebral imaging research has demonstrated the involvement of many cerebral structures in the experience of pain. Background. Intimately linked to the notion of suffering, the affective dimension of pain relies on neurophysiological systems partly distinct anatomically from those involved more specifically in its sensory dimension. Some pathways convey nociceptive information to the somatosensory cortex and the insula, contributing to the sensory aspects of pain (e.g.: sensory intensity)-, and secondarily, to its affective dimension. Other pathways project directly to the anterior cingulate cortex, the insula, the amygdala and to the prefrontal cortices, which are structures involved in the affective dimension of pain (unpleasantness of pain and regulation of autonomic and behavioral responses). Interestingly, these latter regions are an integral part of the cerebral emotional networks. Perspectives and conclusion. This close anatomical relationship between pain and emotions circuits could explain the powerful emotional impact of pain as well as the reciprocal modulatory effect of emotions on pain observed in clinical and experimental studies. More specifically, this modulatory effect might reflect interactions between emotional and nociceptive systems in the prefrontal and cingulate cortices, ventral striatum, amygdala and hippocampal regions. Taken together, these observations further attest to the emotional nature of pain experience.

NKG2D ligands have been detected on many tumor cell types and can be induced on nontransformed cells by environmental signals including DNA damage and inflammation. We investigated the contribution of NKG2D-NKG2D ligand interaction on CNS-directed immune responses. We observed that primary cultures of human adult oligodendrocytes and fetal astrocytes expressed ligands for NKG2D in vitro whereas neurons, microglia, and adult astrocytes did not. Disruption of the NKG2D-NKG2D ligand interaction using blocking antibodies significantly inhibited killing of primary human oligodendrocytes mediated by activated human NK cells, gamma/delta T cells, and allo-reactive CD8(+) T cells. NKG2D ligands [major histocompatibility complex class I chain-related molecules A and B (MICA/B)] were detected in groups of cells and colocalized with an oligodendrocyte marker (adenomatous polyposis coli) in white matter sections obtained from multiple sclerosis lesions but not in normal control samples. CD8(+) T cells could be detected in close proximity to MICA/B+ cells within multiple sclerosis lesions, supporting an in vivo interaction between these immune effectors and stressed MICA/B- expressing oligodendrocytes. These results imply that NKG2D-NKG2D ligand interaction can potentially contribute to cytotoxic responses mediated by activated immune effector cells in the inflamed CNS, as observed in multiple sclerosis.

Using energy from an air-driven piston to turn a wheel, the device advances a conveyor belt with a pre-determined sequence of stimuli that differ in their spatial features into the tunnel of the MRI. The positioning of one or several stimulus objects in a window near the subject's hand is controlled by a photoelectric device that detects periodic openings in the conveyor belt. Using this electric signal to position each presentation avoids cumulative positioning errors and provides a signal related to the progression of the experiment. We used a series of shapes that differed in their spatial features but the device could carry stimuli with a diversity of shapes and textures. This flexibility allows the experimenter to design a wide variety of psychophysical experiments in the haptic world and possibly to compare and contrast these stimuli with the cognitive treatment of similar stimuli delivered to the other senses. Appropriate experimental design allows separation of motor, sensory and memory storage phases of mental processes. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Our previous work has proven that: (1) pain stimulation enhances PVN synthesis and secretion of AVP; (2) AVP in periaqueductal gray (PAG) plays a role in antinociception; (3) pain stimulation increases AVP concentration in PAG tissue. The present study was to investigate AVP source in PAG during pain modulation of the rat. The results showed that: (1) pain stimulation elevated AVP concentration in both PVN and PAG perfusion liquid, in which the peak of AVP concentration in PVN perfusion liquid occurred earlier than that in PAG perfusion liquid; (2) PVN cauterization weakened pain stimulation-induced PAG releasing AVP, in which the inhibitive effect of bilateral PVN cauterization showed stronger than that of unilateral PVN cauterization; (3) microinjection of L-glutamate sodium into PVN, which excited local neurons, increased AVP concentration in PAG perfusion liquid in a dose-dependent manner. The data suggest that AVP in PAG, which relates with pain modulation, comes from PVN. (c) 2006 Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Since fish is also a rich source of n - 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, this study was conducted to examine the effects of dietary fats on MeHg-induced acute toxicity in rats. Weanling male Sprague Dawley rats were administered semi-purified casein-based isocaloric diet containing soy oil, seal oil, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), fish oil, or lard for 28 days. Rats were then gavaged with 0, 1, or 3 mg MeHg/kg body weight (BW) per day and fed the same diet for 14 consecutive days. On 43rd day of the experiment, rats were sacrificed and blood samples were collected and analyzed for hematology. Liver and spleen were removed, fixed, and examined for pathological changes. Blood, feces, liver, and brain were analyzed for total mercury and/or MeHg contents. Serum samples were analyzed for clinical markers of hepatic injury and immunoglobulin. Total mercury contents in all tissues measured increased with dose. Mercury excretion in feces increased with dose and duration of MeHg treatment. Both diets and MeHg showed significant effects and interacted significantly on many of the toxicological endpoints measured. Many of the effects of MeHg were diet-dependent. For example, in the rats fed the lard diet, 3 mg MeHg/kg BW significantly increased relative liver and spleen weight as compared with vehicle control; whereas in rats fed the fish oil, soy oil, seal oil, or DHA, this effect of MeHg was less obvious or absent, suggesting a protective effect of these diets. MeHg at 3 mg/kg BW significantly decreased serum albumin level in all except DHA dietary groups, implying a protection by the DHA diet on this parameter. Only in the lard dietary group, did 3 mg MeHg/kg BW significantly increase serum bilirubin level, indicating an enhancing effect of this diet on MeHg toxicity. MeHg suppressed the adaptive immune system and stimulated the innate immune system in rats in a diet-dependent fashion. The seal oil diet provided more resistance, while the fish oil diet rendered greater sensitivity to these effects of MeHg on the immune system. These results imply significant modulating effects of dietary fats on MeHg toxicity which may translate into more severe or protective clinical outcomes. Therefore, dietary fats are important factors to be considered in the risk assessment of MeHg exposure. Crown Copyright (c) 2006 Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Unequal segregation of mammalian Numb has also been observed, but the factors involved are unknown. Here, we identify in vivo phosphorylation sites of mammalian Numb and show that both mammalian and Drosophila Numb interact with, and are substrates for aPKC in vitro. A form of mammalian Numb lacking two protein kinase C (PKC) phosphorylation sites (Numb2A) accumulates at the cell membrane and is refractory to PKC activation. In epithelial cells, mammalian Numb localizes to the basolateral membrane and is excluded from the apical domain, which accumulates aPKC. In contrast, Numb2A is distributed uniformly around the cell cortex. Mutational analysis of conserved aPKC phosphorylation sites in Drosophila Numb suggests that phosphorylation contributes to asymmetric localization of Numb, opposite to aPKC in dividing sensory organ precursor cells. These results suggest a model in which phosphorylation of Numb by aPKC regulates its polarized distribution in epithelial cells as well as during asymmetric cell divisions.

Vestibular afferents are particularly well suited to study this issue because they are classified as either regular or irregular based on resting discharge variability as well as morphology. Here, we compared the responses of each afferent class to sinusoidal and random head rotations using both information theoretic and gain measures. Information theoretic measures demonstrated that regular afferents transmitted, on average, two times more information than irregular afferents, despite having significantly lower gains. Moreover, consistent with information theoretic measures, regular afferents had angular velocity detection thresholds that were 50% lower than those of irregular afferents (similar to 4 vs 8 degrees/s). Finally, to quantify the information carried by spike times, we added spike-timing jitter to the spike trains of both regular and irregular afferents. Our results showed that this significantly reduced information transmitted by regular afferents whereas it had little effect on irregular afferents. Thus, information is carried in the spike times of regular but not irregular afferents. Using a simple leaky integrate and fire model with a dynamic threshold, we show that differential levels of intrinsic noise can explain differences in the resting discharge, the responses to sensory stimuli, as well as the information carried by action potential timings of each afferent class. Our experimental and modeling results provide new insights as to how neural variability influences the strategy used by two different classes of sensory neurons to encode behaviorally relevant stimuli.

Restricted access to food, but not sucrose, saccharine, or salt, synchronizes the expression of period2 protein in the limbic forebrain	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						clock genes; oval nucleus of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis; central nucleus of the amygdala; basolateral amygdala; dentate gyrus; rat	MPER2 MESSENGER-RNA; STRIA TERMINALIS; SUPRACHIASMATIC NUCLEUS; BED NUCLEUS; ANTICIPATORY ACTIVITY; CONSTANT LIGHT; BASOLATERAL AMYGDALA; CLOCK PROTEIN; CIRCADIAN OSCILLATORS; APPETITIVE BEHAVIOR	Restricted feeding schedules (RF) in which daily access to food is limited to a few hours each day can entrain the rhythms of expression of circadian clock genes in the brain and periphery in rodents. The critical factors mediating the effect of RF on rhythms of clock gene expression are unknown. Previously, we demonstrated that daytime RF shifts the phase of expression of the clock protein, Period2 (PER2) in the oval nucleus of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis in rats kept on a 12-h light/dark cycle, and restored the rhythm of PER2 expression in rats housed in constant light. We now report that RF also modifies the rhythms of PER2 expression in the central and basolateral nuclei of the amygdala and in the dentate gyrus, such that all three areas become synchronized, peaking 12 h after the time of food presentation. Daily limited access to sucrose or saccharine in freely fed rats or scheduled access to saline in sodium-deprived rats had no effect on these PER2 rhythms. Thus, it would appear that the rhythms of PER2 in limbic forebrain structures are sensitive to signals that arise from the alleviation of a negative metabolic state associated with scheduled feeding and that access to rewarding substances in the absence of food deprivation or metabolic challenges, per se, is not sufficient to alter the rhythms of PER2 expression in these regions.

Chemotherapy-evoked painful peripheral neuropathy: analgesic effects of gabapentin and effects on expression of the alpha-2-delta type-1 calcium channel subunit	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						allodynia; hyperalgesia; paclitaxel; neuropathic pain; vincristine	UP-REGULATION; ALPHA(2)DELTA SUBUNIT; MECHANICAL ALLODYNIA; DIABETIC-NEUROPATHY; INJURED RATS; MODELS; PACLITAXEL; DRUGS; AMITRIPTYLINE; PREGABALIN	Chemotherapeutics in the taxane and vinca-alka-loid classes sometimes produce a painful peripheral neuropathy for which there is no validated treatment. Experiments with rat models of paclitaxel- and vincristine-evoked pain suggest that these conditions may not respond to all of the analgesics that have efficacy in other models of painful peripheral neuropathy. We tested gabapentin as a potential analgesic for paclitaxel- and vincristine-evoked pain. We used a repeated dosing paradigm because there are precedents showing that repeated drug exposure may be necessary to demonstrate analgesia in neuropathic pain models. Gabapentin is believed to work via binding to voltage-gated calcium channels that contain the alpha-2-delta type-1 (alpha(2)delta-1) subunit, and the expression of this subunit is known to be increased in some painful peripheral neuropathy models. Thus we also examined whether the paclitaxel-evoked pain syndrome was accompanied by an alpha(2)delta-1 increase, and whether gabapentin had any effect on subunit expression. We found that the paclitaxel- and vincristine-evoked mechano-allodynia and mechano-hyperalgesia were significantly reduced by gabapentin, but only with repeated dosing. Paclitaxel-evoked painful peripheral neuropathy was associated with an increased expression of the alpha(2)delta-1 subunit in the spinal dorsal horn, but not in the dorsal root ganglia. The spinal cord increase was normalized by repeated gabapentin injections. Together, these findings suggest that repeated dosing with gabapentin may be beneficial in patients with chemotherapy-evoked painful peripheral neuropathy and that gabapentin's mechanisms of action may include normalization of the nerve injury-evoked increase in calcium channel alpha(2)delta-1 subunit expression.

At present, little is known about the distinct functions of these factors in optic vesicle growth and on the nature of the main neuroepithelial (NE) progenitor population present in this organ. We have characterized a multipotent cell population present in the mouse optic vesicle that shows extensive proliferation potential and which expresses NE progenitor and retinal markers in vitro. In Pax6 mutant embryos, which form an optic vesicle, we found that the number of resident NE progenitors was greater than normal. In vitro, Pax6-null NE progenitors overproliferate and display reduced P16(Ink alpha), p19(Arf), p27(kip1), p57(kip2), and p21(cip1) expression. Pax6 overexpression repressed cellular proliferation and secondary colonies formation, supporting the hypothesis that Pax6 acts cell-autonomously on NE progenitors cell cycle. Notably, these in vitro data correlated with aberrant numbers of mitosis observed in the optic vesicle of early stage Pax6 mutants, with Pax6 association with the chromatin upstream of p27(kip1) promoter region, and with reduced expression levels of p27(kip1), p57(kip2), and p21(cip1) in the primitive forebrain of Pax6 mutants. Taken together, our results suggest that, prior to retinal progenitor cell identity and neurogenesis, Pax6 is required to regulate the proliferation rate of NE progenitors present in the mouse optic vesicle.

Simvastatin regulates oligodendroglial process dynamics and survival	GLIA			English	Article						multiple sclerosis; myelin repair; myelin; oligodendrocyte; cytoskeleton; RhoA GTPase	HMG-COA REDUCTASE; COENZYME-A REDUCTASE; MULTIPLE-SCLEROSIS; LIPID RAFTS; PC12 CELLS; CLINICAL PHARMACOKINETICS; AUTOIMMUNE-DISEASE; PROGENITOR CELLS; GENE-EXPRESSION; DOWN-REGULATION	Simvastatin, a lipophilic statin that crosses the blood-brain barrier, is being evaluated as a potential therapy for multiple sclerosis (MS) due to its anti-inflammatory properties. We assessed the effects of simvastatin on cultures of rat newborn and human fetal oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) and human adult mature oligodendrocytes (OLGs) with respect to cellular events pertaining to myelin maintenance and repair. Short-term simvastatin treatment of OPCs (I day) induced robust process extension, enhanced differentiation to a mature phenotype, and decreased spontaneous migration. These effects were reversed by isoprenoid products and mimicked with an inhibitor of Rho kinase (ROCK), the downstream effector of the isoprenylated protein RhoA GTPase. Prolonged treatment (2 days) caused process retraction that was rescued by cholesterol, and increased cell death (4 days) partially rescued by either cholesterol or isoprenoid co-treatment. In comparison, simvastatin treatment of human mature OLGs required a longer initial time course (2 days) to induce significant process outgrowth, mimicked by inhibiting ROCK. Prolonged treatment of mature OLGs was associated with process retraction (6 days) and increased cell death (8 days). Human-derived OPCs and mature OLGs demonstrated an increased sensitivity to simvastatin relative to the rodent cells, responding to nanomolar versus micromolar concentrations. Our findings indicate the importance of considering the short- and long-term effects of systemic immunomodulatory therapies on neural cells affected by the MS disease process.

Hippocampal volume is as variable in young as in older adults: Implications for the notion of hippocampal atrophy in humans	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						hippocampus; aging; psychiatry; magnetic resonance imaging	MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; DENTATE GYRUS; HUMAN BRAIN; ENRICHED ENVIRONMENT; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; ENTORHINAL CORTEX; TEMPORAL-LOBE; STRESS; NEUROGENESIS; AGE	Previous studies in humans have shown the presence of an age-related reduction of hippocampal (HC) volume, as well as the presence of reduced HC volume in psychiatric populations suffering from schizophrenia, depression or post-traumatic stress disorder. Altogether, these data suggested that aging or psychiatric disease can have neurotoxic effects on the hippocampus, and lead to HC atrophy. However, these two sets of findings imply that HC volume in young healthy adults should present less variability than HC volume in older adults and psychiatric populations. In the present study, we assessed HC volume in 177 healthy men and women aged from 18 to 85 years of age. We show that the dispersion around the mean of HC volume is not different in young and older adults, so that 25% of young healthy adults present HC volume as small as the average participants aged 60 to 75 years. This shows that HC volume is as variable in young as in older adults and suggests that smaller HC volume attributed to the aging process in previous studies could in fact represent HC volume determined early in life. We also report that within similar age groups, the percentage of difference in HC volume between the individuals with the smallest HC volume (smallest quartile) and the group average is greater than the percentage of difference reported to exist between psychiatric populations and normal control in recent meta-analyses. Taken together, these results confront the notion of hippocampal atrophy in humans and raise the possibility that pre-determined inter-individual differences in HC volume in humans may determine the vulnerability for age-related cognitive impairments or psychopathology throughout the lifetime.

Focal cortical atrophy in multiple sclerosis: Relation to lesion load and disability	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							BRAIN ATROPHY; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; WHITE-MATTER; GRAY-MATTER; MRI DATA; THICKNESS; IMAGES; DEMYELINATION; ADOLESCENTS; MORPHOMETRY	Multiple sclerosis (MS) is thought to predominantly affect white matter (WM). Recently, however, loss of cortical gray matter has also been described. Little is known about the cause of cortical atrophy in MS, whether it occurs early in the disease course, and whether it affects all cortical regions equally or if there is a preferential pattern of focal cortical atrophy. An automated method was used to compute the thickness at every vertex of the cortical surface of the brains of 425 early relapsing-remitting MS patients. We correlated cortical thickness with the WM lesion load and the Expanded Disability Status Scale score. Mean cortical thickness correlated with WM lesion load and disability. The correlations of cortical thickness with total lesion load and disability were most significant in cingulate gyrus, insula, and associative cortical regions. Conversely, primary sensory, visual, and motor areas showed a less significant relationship. The highest amount of atrophy per lesion volume or disability scale unit was in the anterior cingulate cortex. This study confirms the relation between cortical atrophy, WM lesion load, and disability in MS, and suggests that cortical atrophy occurs even in MS patients with only mild disability. Most interestingly, we show a specific regional pattern of focal atrophy in MS that is distinctively different from the one in normal aging. The predilection of the atrophic process for areas that are heavily interconnected with other brain regions suggests that interruption of WM tracts by MS plaques contributes, at least in part, to the development of cortical atrophy.

Participants were recorded in a sleep laboratory for twos consecutive nights after which selective and sustained attention performance was tested. In both groups, of participants, Spearman's rho statistics revealed a negative correlation between reaction time on the selective attention task and sleep spindle density. Only control participants showed a negative correlation between reaction time and duration of stage 2 sleep and a positive correlation between reaction time and duration of stage 1 ("light") sleep. Only persons with schizophrenia showed: a negative correlation between reaction time and duration of stage 4 ("deep") sleep. In the sustained attention task, we found! no correlation between reaction time and sleep for control participants while persons with schizophrenia showed a negative correlation between reaction time and duration of stage 4 sleep. It is proposed that EEG sleep spindle activity is associated with automatic attentional processing, while stage 2 sleep continuity in healthy individuals and percentage of stage 4 in patients with schizophrenia are associated with voluntary processes. These results support the existence of a relationship between non-rapid-eye-movement sleep and cognitive performance in healthy individuals as well as in persons with schizophrenia.

A hydrophobic patch in a charged alpha-helix is sufficient to target proteins to dense core secretory granules	JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							SECONDARY STRUCTURE PREDICTION; CARBOXYPEPTIDASE-E; SORTING RECEPTOR; ATT-20 CELLS; HYDROPHILIC BALANCE; CPE(FAT) MICE; PATHWAY; PEPTIDES; BINDING; PROSOMATOSTATIN	Many endocrine and neuroendocrine cells contain specialized secretory organelles called dense core secretory granules. These organelles are the repository of proteins and peptides that are secreted in a regulated manner when the cell receives a physiological stimulus. The targeting of proteins to these secretory granules is crucial for the generation of certain peptide hormones, including insulin and ACTH. Although previous work has demonstrated that proteins destined to a variety of cellular locations, including secretory granules, contain targeting sequences, no single consensus sequence for secretory granulesorting signals has emerged. We have shown previously that alpha-helical domains in the C-terminal tail of the prohormone convertase PC1/3 play an important role in the ability of this region of the protein to direct secretory granule targeting (Jutras, I. Seidah, N.G., and Reudelhuber, T. L. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 40337-40343). In this study, we show that a variety of alpha-helical domains are capable of directing a heterologous secretory protein to granules. By testing a series of synthetic alpha-helices, we also demonstrate that the presence of charged (either positive or negative) amino acids spatially segregated from a hydrophobic patch in the alpha-helices of secretory proteins likely plays a critical role in the ability of these structures to direct secretory granule sorting.

Odour quantification by a sensor array: An application to landfill gas odours from two different municipal waste treatment works	SENSORS AND ACTUATORS B-CHEMICAL			English	Article						odour quantification; electronic nose; sensor array; landfill gas; artificial neural networks	SEWAGE-TREATMENT WORKS; ELECTRONIC NOSE	The possibility of quantifying the landfill gas (LFG) odour in terms of odour-units per cubic meter (ou/m(3)) using a tin oxide sensor array is investigated. The objective is to determine the most appropriate neural machines (MLP networks, RBF networks) model to perform the odour concentration approximation and evaluate the influence of multiple biogas sources modelling on the approximation quality. The structural risk minimization principle is used instead of the usual empirical risk minimization principle in the training algorithm of the neural machines. Multilayer perceptrons (MLP) networks prove to minimize best the error on the prediction of odour concentration of unknown data. The data is constituted of LFG odour samples from two municipal waste treatment works presenting different concentrations of odorous compounds. It is shown that the quality of the LFG odour approximation is in the present case influenced directly by the size of the training data set. The use of data coming from two different sources is not detrimental to the quality of the approximation. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Rapid conduction and the evolution of giant axons and myelinated fibers	CURRENT BIOLOGY			English	Review							PERIPHERAL-NERVE MYELIN; PROTEIN ZERO; PROTEOLIPID PROTEIN; IMPULSE CONDUCTION; GENE FAMILY; ORGANIZATION; SHEATHS; NEUREXIN; DOMAIN; NODES	Nervous systems have evolved two basic mechanisms for increasing the conduction speed of the electrical impulse. The first is through axon gigantism: using axons several times larger in diameter than the norm for other large axons, as for example in the well-known case of the squid giant axon. The second is through encasing axons in helical or concentrically wrapped multilamellar sheets of insulating plasma membrane - the myelin sheath. Each mechanism, alone or in combination, is employed in nervous systems of many taxa, both vertebrate and invertebrate. Myelin is a unique way to increase conduction speeds along axons of relatively small caliber. It seems to have arisen independently in evolution several times in vertebrates, annelids and crustacea. Myelinated nerves, regardless of their source, have in common a multilamellar membrane wrapping, and long myelinated segments interspersed with 'nodal' loci where the myelin terminates and the nerve impulse propagates along the axon by 'saltatory' conduction. For all of the differences in detail among the morphologies and bio-chemistries of the sheath in the different myelinated animal classes, the function is remarkably universal.

It is unclear whether diabetes treatment should aim at restoring beta-cell performance/mass or at inducing "beta-cell rest" to prevent further deterioration. The transcription factor Foxo1 protects beta-cells against oxidative stress induced by hyperglycemia and prevents beta-cell replication in insulin-resistant states. Here we show that these combined effects are associated with a concerted repression of genes involved in glycolysis, nitric-oxide synthesis, G protein-coupled receptor signaling, and ion transport. Conversely, Foxo1 increases expression of several neurotransmitter receptors and fails to regulate target genes predicted from Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila studies. Functional analyses show decreased glucose utilization and insulin secretion in beta-cells overexpressing Foxo1. We propose the definition of "metabolic diapause" for the changes induced by Foxo1 to protect beta-cells against oxidative stress. The data provide genetic underpinning for the concept of beta-cell rest as a treatment goal in diabetes.

Morphine priming in rats with chronic inflammation reveals a dichotomy between antihyperalgesic and antinociceptive properties of deltorphin	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						delta opioid receptor; deltorphin; chronic inflammation; antihyperalgesia; antinociception; tolerance	DELTA-OPIOID-RECEPTOR; CERVICAL-SPINAL-CORD; DORSAL-ROOT GANGLIA; NEUROPATHIC PAIN; SUPERFICIAL LAYERS; SUPRASPINAL MU; LOCALIZED PAIN; TRAFFICKING; MODEL; HYPERALGESIA	We previously showed that prolonged morphine treatment and chronic inflammation both enhanced delta opioid receptor (delta OR) cell surface density in lumbar spinal cord neurons. Here, we sought to determine whether administration of morphine to rats with chronic inflammation would further increase the bio-availability of delta OR, and thereby the analgesic properties of the delta OR agonist deltorphin, over that produced by inflammation alone. We found that chronic inflammation produced by injection of complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) into the hind paw resulted in a bilateral increase in the binding and internalization of fluorescent deltorphin in neurons of the lumbar spinal cord as did prolonged morphine treatment [Morinville A, Cahill CM, Aibak H, Rymar VV, Pradhan A, Hoffert C, Mennicken F, Stroh T, Sadikot AF, O'Donnell D, Clarke PB, Collier B, Henry JL, Vincent JP, Beaudet A (2004a) Morphine-induced changes in delta opioid receptor trafficking are linked to somatosensory processing in the rat spinal cord. J Neurosci 24:5549-5559]. This effect was accompanied by an increase in the antinociceptive efficacy of intrathecal deltorphin as measured using the tail-flick test. Treatment of CFA-injected rats with morphine decreased the cell surface availability of delta OR in neurons of the dorsal horn of the lumbar spinal cord as compared with treatment with CFA alone. Behaviorally, it significantly enhanced the antihy-peralgesic effects of deltorphin (plantar test; % maximum possible antihyperalgesic effect (MPAHE)=113.5% +/- 32.4% versus 26.1% +/- 11.6% in rats injected with CFA alone) but 'strongly reduced the antinociceptive efficacy of the drug (tail-flick test; % maximum possible antinociceptive effect (MPE)=29.6% +/- 3.6% versus 66.6% +/- 6.3% in rats injected with CFA alone) suggesting that the latter, but not the former, is linked to the delta OR trafficking events observed neuroanatomically. These results demonstrate that in chronic inflammation, the antihyperalgesic effects of delta OR agonists may be enhanced by morphine pre-treatment. They also reveal a dichotomy between mechanisms underlying antihyperalgesic and antinociceptive effects of delta OR agonists. (c) 2006 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The design features a mixed-signal part that handles neural signal conditioning, digitization, and time-division multiplexing, and a digital part that provides control, threshold detection, isolation of spikes, and serial communications towards a host interface. The detection and isolation strategy preserve the entire neuronal spikes waveshapes by means of synchronized internal data buffering. This bandwidth reduction scheme prompts for better postprocessing results and improved performance in prosthetics applications. Both parts of the presented neural interface were fabricated separately in a CMOS 0.18-mu m process. The whole neural interface features 16 channels for validation; besides, the proposed approach is scalable to larger channel counts. In fact, it is suitable for implementation of implantable microsystems including several hundreds of recording channels. The performance of the implemented multi-channel interface was validated in vitro with real neural waveforms.

On long time scales, cell health in response to depolarization and/or hyperpolarization would be able to be quantified. If the reporter has sufficient time resolution, action potentials may be resolved, thus allowing for optical recordings from ensembles of neurons without growing cultures on multielectrode arrays. However, the creation of such probes is extremely challenging. Here we present preliminary results for two genetically-en coded systems: one based upon fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between nanoparticles and an engineered channel, and the second based upon fluorescence complementation (FC). The results suggest that chronic monitoring of neuronal potential is possible with these probes, at least on the scale of hundreds of milliseconds.	[Nadeau, Jay L.; Hollmann, C.

When used with the optical probes, it enables monitoring of the position of the fibers with respect to the anatomy and provides an image of the sensitivity matrix on the anatomical substrate. Given this structural information, we can determine and localize almost exactly the region we want to probe and then position the optical sensors at the right place on the subject's head. We apply these techniques to the measurement of activation during a finger tapping task, in particular the negative BOLD signal observed in fMRI is revisited within the optical framework.

Tuch, reconstructs the diffusion orientation distribution function (ODF) of the underlying fiber population of a biological tissue. An analytical solution for QBI was recently proposed by several independent groups, using a spherical harmonic (SH) representation of the input signal. The methods differ primarily in the way SH are estimated. In this paper we validate these methods and compare them against Tuch's numerical QBI on synthetic data, on a biological phantom and on a human brain dataset. We show that analytical QBI results in a speed-up factor of 15 over Tuch's QBI, while providing results that are in strong agreement. We also show that at the cost of slightly reducing angular resolution, QBI with Laplace-Beltrami regularization provides the strongest robustness to noise and the most accurate detection of fiber crossings.

Based on the classical Duhem model described by a differential equation, we explore the explicit solution to the equation and construct a new hysteretic model with a linear model in series with a piecewise continuous nonlinear function. A NN-based dynamic pre-inversion compensator is designed to cancel the effect of the hysteresis. With the incorporation of-the pre-inversion compensator, an adaptive control scheme is proposed to make the position of the piezoelectric actuator track the desired trajectory. The paper has three distinct features. First, it applies NN to approximate complicate piecewise continuous unknown nonlinear functions in the explicit solution to Dubem model. Second, no off-line training is required for the NN. Third, the stability of overall controlled piezoelectric actuator is guaranteed. Simulation results for a practical system illustrate the validation and effectiveness of the proposed method in this paper.

Automatic detection of individual BS events has a clinical and practical importance for brain function monitoring in the neurological ICUs (NICUs) using Continuous EEG (CEEG). In this paper, we present a novel method to automatically detect burst suppression events. The method is based on segmentation and detection of the suppression component of the BS event using integrated EEG signal across the channels of interest. Decisional rules are then applied to the suppression segments to identify the actual BS events. Additionally, algorithms were developed to identify EEG containing loose electrodes as well as those with EMG and large amplitude contaminations. The overall BS event detection sensitivity is greater than 92% with a specificity of 83% on data from 4 ICU recordings.

Consequently, VOR measurements are often restricted to either conjugate recordings or to single eye recordings. During binocular recordings of the angular VOR in the dark, we observed a significant vergence component even in normal subjects. More interestingly, the measured vergence component modulated with head velocity. The modulation of vergence during the VOR in the dark could imply a vestibular contribution to vergence. These observations suggest a shared central controller for both version and vergence.

Nondirectional surface morphometry has' been previously used to detect regions of cortical atrophy using brain MRI data. However evaluating directional changes on surfaces requires computing gradients to obtain a full metric tensor. Non-directionally, reduces the sensitivity of deformation-based morphometry to area-preserving, deformations. By proposing a method to compute directional derivatives, this paper enables analysis of directional deformations,on surfaces. Moreover, Me proposed method exhibits improved numerical accuracy when evaluating mean curvature, compared to the so-called cotangent formula. The directional deformation. of folding patterns was measured. in two groups of surfaces and the proposed methodology allowed to detect morphological differences that were not detected using previous non-directional morphometry. The methodology uses a closed-form analytic formalism rather than numerical approximation and is readily generalizable to any application involving surface deformation.

Examples include white matter fibre tracts, textures, fur and hair We develop a differential geometric characterization of such structures by considering the local behaviour of the associated 3D frame field, leading to the associated tangential, normal and bi-normal curvature functions. Using results from the theory of generalized minimal surfaces we adopt a generalized helicoid model as an osculating object and develop the connection between its parameters and these curvature functions. These developments allow for the construction of parametrized 3D vector fields (sampled osculating objects) to locally approximate these patterns. We apply these results to the analysis of diffusion MRI data via a type of 3D streamline flow. Experimental results on data from a human brain demonstrate the advantages of incorporating the full differential geometry.

None of the participants found a correct solution within 30 minutes without help of demonstrations or instructions. In this paper, we model human performance on this task using a biologically plausible computational model based on reinforcement learning. We use a SARSA-based Softmax learning algorithm where the reward function is learned using cascade-correlation neural networks. First, we find that the task can be learned by reinforcement alone with substantial training. Second, we study the number of alternative actions available to Softmax and find that 5 works well for this problem which is compatible with estimates of human working memory size. Third, we find that simulations are less accurate than humans given equivalent amount of training. We suggest that humans use means-ends analysis to self-generate rewards in non-terminal states. Implementing such self-generated rewards might improve model accuracy. Finally, we pretrain models to prefer simple actions, like humans. We partially capture a simplicity bias, and find that it had little impact on accuracy.

The source-detector part is composed of a multi-wavelength LED and a silicon photodetector that are directly placed on the scalp of the subject. The dimensions of the proposed device are small, as it has to be mounted on the head of an adult person. Acquired data are transmitted in real-time to a laptop for post processing using Matlab. Time-multiplexed fight is used to achieve a higher SNR while keeping the device safe for long-term wearing. Preliminary evaluation on adults gave the expected accuracy and compare well with fNIRS characteristics found in literature, that are collected from bulky equipment. With a noise figure of -47dB and a sampling rate of 23Hz, the presented device is appropriate to isolate hemodynamic variations, which are strongly related to local cerebral activity.

A multivalued phonological feature set defined by King and Taylor is used along with a time delay neural network implementation of phonological feature detectors to produce eight independent phonological feature streams [1]. Hidden Markov models (HMMs) defined over these phonological feature streams are combined with HMMs defined over spectral energy based mel frequency cepstrum coefficient (MFCC) acoustic features through a lattice re-scoring procedure. It is shown that significant improvements in phone recognition accuracy are obtained for this combined system relative to phone accuracy obtained for MFCC based HMMs alone.

The nonlinear system is subject to state and sensor uncertainties and disturbances. A recurrent nonlinear-in-parameters neural network (NLPNN) is employed to identify the general unknown fault. The neural network weights are updated based on a modified backpropagation scheme. Unlike many previous methods, the proposed fault detection and isolation scheme does not rely on the availability of all state measurements. The stability of the overall fault detection approach in the presence of unknown faults as well as plant and sensor uncertainties is shown using Lyapunov's direct method. Stability analysis presented here imposes no restrictive assumptions on the system and/or the FDI algorithm.

Unlike most existing fault diagnosis techniques, the proposed solution provides an integrated framework to simultaneously detect, isolate, and estimate the severity of faults in system components. The proposed solution consists of a bank of adaptive Neural Parameter Estimators (NPE) where each NPE in the bank is designed based on a separate parameterized fault model. Each NPE in the bank estimates its corresponding unknown Fault Parameter (FP) that is farther used for fault detection and estimation purposes. Fast convergence and simple isolation policy are among the characteristic features of our proposed solution. Static neural network architecture and simple weight adaptation laws also make the proposed technique appropriate for real-time implementations. Simulation results reveal the effectiveness of the developed scheme in detecting, isolating and estimating faults in components of reaction wheel actuators of a 3-axis stabilized satellite even in presence of satellite disturbances.

Non-visual feedback can aid the continuous motion control tasks that such applications frequently entail. An architecture is introduced for enabling interaction with a system that furnishes a number of gestural affordances with assistive feedback. The approach combines machine learning techniques for understanding a user's gestures with a method for the display of salient features of the underlying inference process in real time. Methods used include a particle filter to track multiple hypotheses about a user's input as the latter is unfolding, together with models of the nonlinear dynamics intrinsic to the movements of interest. Non-visual feedback in this system is based on a presentation of error features derived from an estimate of the sampled time varying probability that the user's gesture corresponds to the various tracked state trajectories in the different dynamical systems. We describe applications to interactive systems for human gait analysis and rehabilitation, a domain of considerable current interest in the movement sciences and health care.

A first pre-processing step involves an offline planning generating a large dataset of multi-objective trajectories, covering mostly the robot workspace. The optimized criteria are travelling time, consumed energy, and singularity avoidance. The offline planning is initialized through a cycloidal minimum time parameterized trajectory in joint space. This trajectory is then optimized using an augmented Lagrangian technique. The outcomes of this pre-processing step allow building a Tsukamoto neuro-fuzzy inference system to learn and capture the robot multi-objective dynamic behavior. Once this system is trained and optimized, it is used in a generalization phase to achieve online planning. Simulation results showing the effectiveness of the proposal are presented and discussed.

Two indicators are considered for monitoring on-line the effect of learning: the separation property, which has already been studied in previous works, and an incremental version of the statistical complexity measure that is introduced expressly for our needs. It is found that while separation increases, a neuron's average statistical complexity decreases when a learning rule is applied. This means that neurons become more predictable and their behavior is simplified as an effect of learning. A key feature of this work is to provide a quantification of this phenomenon.

Face recognition in video using a what-and-where fusion neural network	2007 IEEE INTERNATIONAL JOINT CONFERENCE ON NEURAL NETWORKS, VOLS 1-6	IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)		English	Proceedings Paper	International Joint Conference on Neural Networks	AUG 12-17, 2007	Orlando, FL	IEEE			CLASSIFICATION; TRACKING	A What-and-Where fusion neural network is applied to the recognition of human faces from video sequences. ne spatio-temporal information contained in successive video frames allows to effectively accumulate a classifier's predictions for each person being tracked in an environment. In a particular realization of this network, a fuzzy ARTMAP neural network is used to classify faces detected in each frame, while a bank of Kalman filters; is used to track blobs that contain the extracted faces moving in the environment. Performance of the What-and-Where fusion neural network is compared to that of the fuzzy ARTMAP and k-Nearest-Neighbor (k-NN) classifiers in terms of classification rate, convergence time and compression. In this paper, the impact on performance of setting different region of interest (ROI), of optimizing fuzzy ARTMAP parameters, and of selecting different training subset sizes, is assessed. Simulation results on real-world video sequences indicate that this network can achieve a classification rate that is significantly higher (by approximately 50% in some cases) than that of fuzzy ARTMAP alone, and than that of the k-NN.

To achieve this objective, three neural networks are developed for modeling the dynamics of a reaction wheel on all the three axes separately. A recurrent neural network with backpropagation training algorithm is considered for representing the highly nonlinear dynamics of the actuator. The capabilities and potential of the proposed neural network-based fault detection and isolation (FDI) methodology is investigated and a comparative study is conducted with the performance of a generalized Luenberger observer-based scheme. Simulation results demonstrate clearly the advantages of our proposed neural network scheme studied in this paper.	[Li, Z.

This modeling approach is proposed on a mixed-signal (analog/digital) CMOS 0.18 mu m circuit dedicated to neural signal recording. This ICEM allows coarse and fast studies of the electromagnetic compatibility of CMOS devices especially in characterizing the coupling phenomena that occurs at each building block inside the whole chip. ICEM simulations of power and ground bounces are more than 500 times faster than complete SPICE ones with a correct accuracy for first electromagnetic compatibility investigations. This quick modeling method allows for checking many different design or simulation configurations. For example, some simulation results show that substrate interactions and power/ground crosstalk increase the noise level of the low-noise amplifier, in particular in its low frequency domain.

It is dedicated to demonstrate the efficiency of bilateral sacral roots stimulation during chronic experiments in small animals (rats). The complete BSN implant has been highly miniaturized. It is powered and controlled by an inductive RF link and includes two channels. Even though they are meant for simultaneous operation, the channels outputs are synchronized to avoid drawing high stimulation currents at the same time. In addition, an alternating monophasic stimulation is used to reduce charge injection while keeping the advantage of charge balancing of the biphasic stimulation. The BSN prototype has been assembled on two circular printed circuit boards of 2-cm diameter each. With a total rms power consumption of less than 15mW, the BSN can provide a stimulation current up to 2mA, with maximum pulse width of 210 mu s and a maximum frequency of 2kHz.

B	Nerguizian, C; Nerguizian, V			IEEE	Nerguizian, Chahe; Nerguizian, Vahe			Indoor fingerprinting geolocation using wavelet-based features extracted from the channel impulse response in conjunction with an artificial neural network	2007 IEEE INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONICS, PROCEEDINGS, VOLS 1-8			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics	JUN 04-07, 2007	Vigo, SPAIN	IEEE				This paper proposes a method to localize a mobile station in an indoor environment using wavelet-based features (WBF) extracted from the channel impulse response (CIR) in conjunction with an artificial neural network (ANN). The proposed localization system makes use of the fingerprinting technique and employs CIR information as the signature and an artificial neural network as the pattern matching algorithm. For the considered indoor environment, the obtained CIR information can not be applied directly to the input of the ANN due to the high number of the CIR samples since an ANN with a high number of inputs requires a high number of learning patterns during its training. Consequently, relevant features reflecting the CIR signature have to be extracted and then applied to the ANN. The relevant features may be some physical channel parameters or a compressed version of the CIR signature. In this paper, the extraction of the CIR features is done using a wavelet-based compression. The particularity of the method is in the representation of the CIR signature in a judicious way facilitating the design of the ANN. Moreover, when the extracted features correspond to the CIR signature, the localization system tends to give mobile location with a high precision. Simulation of measured CIR in an indoor environment, showed a precision of 2 meters for 91% and 70% of trained and untrained data, respectively.

The carotid body regulates ventilation via the release of neurotransmitters detected by the brain. Clinical studies to determine the age-dependent release of AT? stimulated at the rat carotid body are presented for potassium depolarization, hypoxic (low O-2), and hypercapnic (high CO2) conditions. Laterally resolved release of ATP was measured at the carotid body using a miniaturized dual-enzyme biosensor based on the co-immobilization of the enzymes glucose oxidase and hexokinase at various stimuli for establishing the dose-response of the carotid body from rat pups. Thereby, quantification of extracellular ATP released by the carotid body was achieved at various physiological conditions.

In particular, we are interested in studying single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) as genetic markers as predictors of a dichotomous disease outcome. The problem we are investigating is that of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions as determinants of the expression of complex diseases. This study builds on our previous work for a single gene testing procedure developed and presented earlier [1]. As for single SNPs pre-selection [1], we rely on ANN sensitivity analysis algorithms to detect potential pairs of interacting SNPs associated with the disease outcome. The statistical test for SNP interaction is computed using a bootstrap technique and is based on the measure of the predictive significance of two SNPs from the change in the ANN error function (SVM regression error) when these two SNPs are removed from the ANN or SVM genotype-phenotype models. To investigate the power to detect and test gene-gene interactions we simulated genotypes including two interacting loci with low marginal effects, incomplete penetrance and phenocopies according to three different models of interaction.

In this work, we propose a chaotic synchronization-based representation of semantic entities (objects, events) in surveillance scenes using MPEG-7 low low-level Ds, MPEG-7 visual Descriptors(Ds) are used to extract low-level features of video objects. The chaotic synchronization is used to perform feature binding (i.e, group semantically relevant feature elements) from these Ds. The objective is to search for unique numeric description (based on low-level features) to identify semantic entitles. The idea of a semantic space is introduced to explain feature binding from multiple features spaces. Subjective evaluation (based on classification) shows the existence of such numeric description for related semantic entitles (e.g, male, female. automobile, multiple persons, enter, appear, move).

These algorithms allow clinical researchers to generate quantitative data analyses with consistently accurate results. With the increasingly large data sets being used in brain mapping, there has been a significant rise in the need for methods to accelerate these algorithms, as their computation time can consume many hours. This paper presents the results from a recent study on implementing such quantitative analysis algorithms on High-Performance Reconfigurable Computers (HPRCs). A brain tissue classification algorithm for MRI, the Partial Volume Estimation (PVE), is implemented on an SGI RASC RC100 system using the Mitrion-C High-Level Language (HLL). The CPU-based PVE algorithm is profiled and computationally intensive floating-point functions are implemented on FPGA-accelerators. The images resulting from the FPGA-based algorithm are compared to those generated by the CPU-based algorithm for verification. The Similarity Indexes (SI) for pure tissues are calculated to measure the accuracy of the images resulting from the FPGA-based implementation. The portion of the PVE algorithm that was implemented on hardware achieved a 11 x performance improvement over the CPU-based implementation. The overall performance improvement of the FPGA-accelerated PVE algorithm was 3.5 x with four FPGAs.

It is implemented using standard TSMC 0.18um CMOS process and is characterized by SpectreS simulator under the Cadence environment.

When a person has neurological deficits, this ability is usually impaired. Moreover, recent evidence supports a relationship between executive function deficits and dual task performance. Most of the studies that examine the effect of dual tasking on motor and cognitive aspects simultaneously have not been performed in ecological environments and have not examined the effect of different types of perturbations on performance. The purpose of this paper is to present the feasibility of using advanced technology of virtual reality (VR) to identify the neurophysiological mechanisms that underlie dual task performance within a functional virtual environment in people who have executive function deficits. The participants will be tested for their balance, gait and arm functions as they walk in a virtual supermarket, performing tasks at different levels of complexity which require the use of executive functions. The results will increase our knowledge of human performance during multiple task accomplishment in ecologically valid environments.

Hippocampal volumes and diffusion-weighted image findings in children with prolonged febrile seizures	ACTA NEUROLOGICA SCANDINAVICA			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	International Symposium on Status Epilepticus in Infants and Young Children	APR 29-30, 2006	Osaka, JAPAN	Infantile Seizure Soc Japan		magnetic resonance image; diffusion-weighted; image; hippocampus; volume; febrile seizure; status epilepticus	PARTIAL STATUS EPILEPTICUS; TEMPORAL-LOBE EPILEPSY; FOLLOW-UP; MRI; ABNORMALITIES; PERFUSION; NUCLEI	Objectives - To assess hippocampal volumes (HV) and signal changes on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) within 5 days of prolonged febrile seizures (PFS) and compare them with the PFS duration and EEG. Methods - We studied 12 children (mean age: 32 21 months, range 10 months-5 years) within 5 days of a first episode of PFS (a seizure or series of seizures lasting for 30 min or longer, without return of consciousness between the seizures). The HV measurements were carried out using high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging and signal intensity abnormalities were evaluated visually on DWI. HV in patients were compared with those of 13 neurologically normal controls (mean age 31 +/- 16 months, range 15 months-5 years). HV abnormalities correlated with PFS duration. HV and DWI abnormalities were compared with EEG abnormalities. Results - Seizure duration ranged from 40 to 95 min. In seven out of twelve patients, seizures were refractory and lasted for 60 min or longer despite intravenous infusion of diazepam. In the patients with PFS for 60 min or longer, HV were significantly larger than that of controls. In all patients, there was a positive correlation between HV and seizure duration. DWI showed hyperintensity in unilateral hippocampus in three patients with intractable seizures, ipsilateral thalamus in two, and cingulate in one. EEG showed abnormalities in temporal areas ipsilateral to the DWI abnormalities in these patients. Conclusions - Large HV and hippocampal hyperintensity on DWI were seen in patients with refractory PFS. Our results suggest that medically refractory PFS lasting for 60 min or longer may cause structural changes in limbic structures that could promote later epileptogenesis.

It is not clear how the brain processes uncertain visual information. We have tested electrophysiological activity of the visual cortex (area V4), which is responsible for shape classifications. We formulate a theory in which different visual stimuli are described through their attributes and placed into a decision table, together with the neural responses to them, which are treated as decision attributes. We assume that the brain interprets sensory input as bottom-up information which is related to hypotheses, while top-down information is related to predictions. We have divided neuronal responses into three categories: (a) Category 0 - cell response is below 20 spikes/s, which indicates that the hypothesis is rejected, (b) Category 1 - cell activity is higher than 20 spikes/s, which implies that the hypothesis is accepted, 3. Category 2 - cell response is above 40 spikes/s, which means that the hypothesis and prediction are valid. By comparing responses of different cells we have found equivalent concept classes. However, many different cells show inconsistency between their decision rules, which may suggest that parallel different decision logics may be implemented in the brain.

Based on composite control method, NNs arc used to approximate the complicate nonlinear functions in both fast and slow control components so that the developed NN controllers make the link position of the robot follow the desired trajectory. By using Lyapunov theorem extension, the stability of the whole system has been proved and the output of the system is guaranteed to converge to the desired trajectory with bounded errors. The simulation results arc presented to show the effectiveness of the approach.

The advantages of such an approach are that the robustness can be reached without modifying the recognition system, and that neither assumption nor estimation of the noise are required. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, an extensive set of continuous speech recognition experiments are carried out by using the NTIMIT telephone speech database.

This discussion is devoted to supervised classification and therefore the essential framework is the family of feedforward nets. Ciampi and Lechevallier have studied two- and three-hidden-layer feedforward neural nets that are equivalent to trees, characterized by neurons with "hard" thresholds. Softening the thresholds has led to more general models. Also, neural nets that realize additive models have been studied, as well as networks of networks that represent a "mixed" classifier (predictor) consisting of a tree component and an additive component. Various "dependent" variables have been studied, including the case of censored survival times. A new development has recently been proposed: the soft tree. A soft tree can be represented as a particular type of hierarchy of experts. This representation can be shown to be equivalent to that of Ciampi and Lechevallier. However, it leads to an appealing interpretation, to other possible generalizations and to a new approach to training. Soft trees for classification and prediction of a continuous variable will be presented. Comparisons between conventional trees (trees with hard thresholds) and soft trees will be discussed and it will be shown that the soft trees achieve better predictions than the hard tree.

While hypnosis-like phenomena have a documented history going back thousands of years, accounts of placebo effects span several centuries. With the rise of biological psychiatry and the "pharmacological revolution," drug trials have taken a central place in clinical research. These clinical trials increasingly incorporate placebo-controlled conditions as part of their paradigms and may even involve an element of deception. In contrast, the therapeutic effects of hypnosis do not require deception. As researchers begin to identify genetic and neural correlates of hypnotizability, these findings may further elucidate placebo phenomena. Whereas identifying highly hypnotizable individuals may be of limited interest, identifying good placebo responders may revolutionize both basic research and clinical science, offer insights into transcultural psychiatry and elucidate individual differences.

Selective biasing of a specific bistable-figure percept involves fMRI signal changes in frontostriatal circuits: A step toward unlocking the neural correlates of top-down control and self-regulation	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF CLINICAL HYPNOSIS			English	Article						Top-down effect; cognitive control; cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical (CSTC) circuits; attention; expectation; hypnosis; self-regulation; impulse control		Attention, suggestion, context and expectation can all exert top-down influence on bottom-up processes (e.g., stimulus-driven mechanisms). Identifying the functional neuroanatomy that subserves top-down influences on sensory information processing can unlock the neural substrates of how suggestion can modulate behavior. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we scanned 10 healthy participants (five men) viewing five bistable figures. Participants received a directional cue to perceive a particular spatial orientation a few seconds before the bistable figure appeared. After presentation, participants pressed a button to indicate their locking into the one desired orientation of the two possible interpretations. Participants additionally performed tests of impulse control and sustained attention. Our findings reveal the role of specific frontostriatal structures in selecting a particular orientation for bistable figures, including dorsolateral prefrontal regions and the putamen. Additional contrasts further bolstered the role of the frontostriatal system in the top-down processing of competing visual perceptions. Separate correlations of behavioral variables with fMRI activations support the idea that the frontostriatal system may mediate attentional control when selecting among competing visual perceptions. These results may generalize to other psychological functions. With special relevance to clinical neuroscience and applications involving attention, expectation and suggestion (e.g., hypnosis), our results address the importance of frontostriatal circuitry in behavioral modulation.

Different notions of specificity exist (e.g., clinical, biological, and behavioral). Behavioral specificity takes on new meaning in light of recent neuroimaging and genetic findings. Drawing on the metaphor of pharmacological specificity, we provide converging data suggesting that, at least for certain individuals, specific behavioral interventions can influence focal brain activations. Interpretation of these data paves the road to a more scientific strategy for studying the neural basis of suggestion and placebo response, and holds promise for the optimal matching of patient and treatment.

However, drug treatments for TS involve side effects and are potentially toxic to the central nervous system. Moreover, current pharmacological treatments are largely ineffective and at best only provide a modest symptom reduction. In this paper, we describe how non-pharmacological treatments such as focused attention can modulate, reduce, or indeed entirely eliminate the symptoms of TS as well as elucidate the underlying neural mechanisms. Showing that the symptoms of TS are susceptible to self-regulatory interventions such as hypnosis, we propose that attentional training could be used to both treat the disorder and better understand it.

Mutations in the KIAA0196 gene at the SPG8 locus cause hereditary spastic paraplegia	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF HUMAN GENETICS			English	Article							CYTOSKELETAL PROTEIN; SPECTRIN REPEAT; ZEBRAFISH; ATAXIAS; MAPS; PREVALENCE; EXPRESSION; DROSOPHILA; SEQUENCE; 8Q	Hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) is a progressive upper-motor neurodegenerative disease. The eighth HSP locus, SPG8, is on chromosome 8p24.13. The three families previously linked to the SPG8 locus present with relatively severe, pure spastic paraplegia. We have identified three mutations in the KIAA0196 gene in six families that map to the SPG8 locus. One mutation, V626F, segregated in three large North American families with European ancestry and in one British family. An L619F mutation was found in a Brazilian family. The third mutation, N471D, was identified in a smaller family of European origin and lies in a spectrin domain. None of these mutations were identified in 500 control individuals. Both the L619 and V626 residues are strictly conserved across species and likely have a notable effect on the structure of the protein product strumpellin. Rescue studies with human mRNA injected in zebrafish treated with morpholino oligonucleotides to knock down the endogenous protein showed that mutations at these two residues impaired the normal function of the KIAA0196 gene. However, the function of the 1,159-aa strumpellin protein is relatively unknown. The identification and characterization of the KIAA0196 gene will enable further insight into the pathogenesis of HSP.

The aim of this study was to examine the validity of the CES-D for depression in a workplace. Methods The CES-D was administered to 2,219 workers (84.2% men; age 21-68 years) at a manufacturing company in Japan. Concomitantly all workers had an interview with the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) as a gold standard for diagnosing major depressive disorder (MDD). The validity was evaluated by a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Results The area under the ROC curve of the CES-D was 0.96 [95% Confidence Interval (CI): 0.94-0.991. The optimal cut-off score of MDD was 19 for screening. Conclusions The validity of CES-D is confirmed and it is a valid instrument for detecting MDD in working populations in Japan.

Preemptive, but not reactive, spinal cord stimulation mitigates transient ischemia-induced myocardial infarction via cardiac adrenergic neurons	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY-HEART AND CIRCULATORY PHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						alpha(1)-adrenoceptor; beta-adrenoceptor; ventricular infarction; neuromodulation	ANGINA-PECTORIS; RABBIT; NOREPINEPHRINE; CATECHOLAMINES; ACTIVATION; PROTECTION; ADENOSINE; OCCLUSION; RELEASE; TRIALS	Our objective was to determine whether electrical neuromodulation using spinal cord stimulation ( SCS) mitigates transient ischemia-induced ventricular infarction and, if so, whether adrenergic neurons are involved in such cardioprotection. The hearts of anesthetized rabbits, subjected to 30 min of left anterior descending coronary arterial occlusion ( CAO) followed by 3 h of reperfusion ( control), were compared with those with preemptive SCS ( starting 15 min before and continuing throughout the 30-min CAO) or reactive SCS ( started at 1 or 28 min of CAO). For SCS, the dorsal C8-T2 segments of the spinal cord were stimulated electrically ( 50 Hz, 0.2 ms, 90% of motor threshold). For preemptive SCS, separate groups of animals were pretreated 15 min before SCS onset with 1) vehicle, 2) prazosin ( alpha(1)- adrenoceptor blockade), or 3) timolol ( beta- adrenoceptor blockade). Infarct size ( IS), measured with tetrazolium, was expressed as a percentage of risk zone. In controls exposed to 30 min of CAO, IS was 36.4 +/- 9.5% ( SD). Preemptive SCS reduced IS to 21.8 +/- 6.8% ( P < 0.001). Preemptive SCS- mediated infarct reduction was eliminated by prazosin ( 36.6 +/- 8.8%) and blunted by timolol ( 29.4 +/- 7.5%). Reactive SCS did not reduce IS. SCS increased phosphorylation of cardiac PKC. SCS did not alter blood pressure or heart rate. We conclude that preemptive SCS reduces the size of infarcts induced by transient CAO; such cardioprotection involves cardiac adrenergic neurons.

Here we describe recent advances toward understanding the molecular mechanisms that underlie adhesive binding, specificity, and diversity for several well-characterized families of adhesion molecules in the nervous system. Although many families of adhesion proteins, including cadherins and immunoglobulin superfamily members, are utilized in neural and nonneural contexts, nervous system-specific diversification mechanisms, such as precisely regulated alternative splicing, provide an important means to enable their function in the complex context of the nervous system.

Among all tested compounds, potent inhibitory activities were recorded for chalcones 1, 4, 5, and 6 and to a lesser extent for 2 and 3. Semi- synthetic derivatives 7-9 displayed low (< 30%) MMP- 2 secretion inhibitory activity at concentrations ranging from 0.025 to 250 mu M. Chalcones 1, 4, 5, and 6 were found to be more active in comparison to the documented MMP secretion inhibitors chlorogenic acid (CHL) and epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCg). Hydrogenation of 1 and acid-catalyzed cyclization of 3 were performed, thus generating three semi-synthetic derivatives (7- 9). The newly synthesized flavanone 7 (cycloglabrol) and its chalcone analog 8 (isocycloglabrol) exhibited low MMP- 2 secretion inhibitory activity with 30% inhibition at 250 mu M. The activity of Dorstenia barteri crude extracts could be attributable to the high concentration of prenylated chalcones and more specifically to stipulin 5. Altogether, the structure-activity relationships established indicated that the hydroxyl, 2,3-double bond, the prenyl group, and its positioning could account for their role in inhibiting MMP-2 secretion, a process involved in extracellular matrix degradation and brain tumor progression.

Systemic Lupus Int Collaborating C	Neuropsychiatric events at the time of diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus - An international inception cohort study	ARTHRITIS AND RHEUMATISM			English	Article							OF-RHEUMATOLOGY CRITERIA; NERVOUS-SYSTEM; COGNITIVE DYSFUNCTION; NATURAL-HISTORY; CLINICAL-COURSE; DISEASE; PREVALENCE; PROGNOSIS; MANIFESTATIONS; DEFINITIONS	Objective. To describe the prevalence, characteristics, attribution, and clinical significance of neuropsychiatric (NP) events in an international inception cohort of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients. Methods. The study was conducted by the Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics (SLICC). Patients were enrolled within 15 months of fulfilling the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) SLE classification criteria. All NP events within a predefined enrollment window were identified using the ACR case definitions of 19 NP syndromes. Decision rules were derived to determine the proportion of NP disease attributable to SLE. Clinical significance was determined using the Short Form 36 (SF-36) Health Survey and the SLICC/ACR Damage Index (SDI). Results. A total of 572 patients (88% female) were recruited, with a mean +/- SD age of 35 +/- 14 years. The mean +/- SD disease duration was 5.2 +/- 4.2 months. Within the enrollment window, 158 of 572 patients (28%) had at least 1 NP event. In total, there were 242 NP events that encompassed 15 of 19 NP syndromes. The proportion of NP events attributed to SLE varied from 19% to 38% using alternate attribution models and occurred in 6.1-11.7% of patients. Those with NP events, regardless of attribution, had lower scores on the SF-36 and higher SDI scores compared with patients with no NP events. Conclusion. Twenty-eight percent of SLE patients experienced at least 1 NP event around the time of diagnosis of SLE, of which only a minority were attributed to SLE. Regardless of attribution, the occurrence of NP events was associated with reduced quality of life and increased organ damage.

OA pain is caused by aberrant functioning of a pathologically altered nervous system with key mechanistic drivers from peripheral nerves and central pain pathways. This review focuses on symptomatic pain therapy exemplified by molecular targets that alter sensitization and hyperexcitability of the nervous system, for example, opioids and cannabinoids. We highlight opportunities for targeting inflammatory mediators and their key receptors (for example, prostanoids, kinins, cytokines and chemokines), ion channels (for example, NaV1.8, NaV1.7 and CaV2.2) and neurotrophins (for example, nerve growth factor), noting evidence that relates to their participation in OA etiology and treatment. Future neurological treatments of pain appear optimistic but will require the systematic evaluation of emerging opportunities.

We propose a modified saliency map mechanism that uses a simple top-down task-dependent cue to allow attention to stay mainly on one object in the scene each time for the first few shifts. Such a method allows the learning of invariant object representations across attention shifts in a multiple-object scene. In this paper, we construct a neural network that can learn position and viewpoint invariant representations for objects across attention shifts in a temporal sequence.

Netrins and their receptors	AXON GROWTH AND GUIDANCE	ADVANCES IN EXPERIMENTAL MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY		English	Article							GROWTH CONE GUIDANCE; UBIQUITIN-PROTEASOME PATHWAY; PIONEER AXON MIGRATIONS; ADENOSINE A2B RECEPTOR; CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; EMBRYONIC SPINAL-CORD; DCC MESSENGER-RNA; C-ELEGANS; COLORECTAL-CANCER; COMMISSURAL AXONS	Netrins are a family of proteins that direct cell and axon migration during development. Three secreted netrins (netrin-1, -3 and -4) have been identified in mammals, in addition to two GPI-anchored membrane proteins, netrin-G1 and G2. Orthologues of netrin-1 play a highly conserved role as guidance cues at the midline of the developing CNS of vertebrates and some bilaterally symmetric invertebrates. In vertebrates, floor plate cells at the ventral midline of the embryonic neural tube secrete netrin-1, generating a circumferential gradient of netrin protein in the neuroepithelium. This protein gradient is bifunctional, attracting some axons to the midline and repelling others. Receptors for the secreted netrins include DCC (deleted in colorectal cancer) and the UNC5 homologues: UNC5A, B, C and D in mammals. DCC mediates chemoattraction, while repulsion requires an UNC5 homologue and, in some cases, DCC. The netrin-G proteins bind NGLs (netrin G ligands), single pass transmembrane proteins unrelated to either DCC or the UNC5 homologues. Netrin function is not limited to the developing CNS midline. Various netrins direct cell and axon migration throughout the embryonic CNS, and in some cases continue to be expressed in the mature nervous system. Furthermore, although initially identified for their ability to guide axons, functional roles for netrins have now been identified outside the nervous system where they influence tissue morphogenesis by directing cell migration and regulating cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion.

However, the pathogenesis of these neurodegenerative states is not yet well understood. Thus, to evaluate the molecular mechanisms leading to those diseases, suitable research tools such as synthetic polyglutamine peptides are required. The synthesis and purification of such peptides are usually difficult because of poor solubility, which leads to low coupling andlor deblocking reactivity. After exploring many synthesis, solubilization and purification approaches, a protocol allowing the production of polyglutamines in good yield and high purity was developed. With this protocol, peptides of 10-30 glutamine residues were synthesized using a linear solid-phase strategy combined with a maximal side-chain protection scheme using fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl (Fmoc) chemistry. After cleavage of the peptide from the polymeric support, the crude material was treated with glacial acetic acid and lyophilized. This treatment Significantly improved the solubility of the polyglutamine peptides thus allowing their dissolution in aqueous conditions and purification through reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography. These solubilization and purification conditions led to the formation of N-pyroglutamyl peptide derivatives that were easily isolated.

Methods and procedures: Ten people with moderate or severe TBI were compared to 10 healthy subjects for neuropsychological measures in the clinic, as well as locomotor patterns and reading time in the laboratory for adapted Stroop tasks ( Bar and Word) during unobstructed and obstructed walking. Main outcomes and results: As previously found [ 1] ( Vallee M, McFadyen BJ, Swaine B, Doyon J, Cantin JF, Dumas D. Effects of environmental demands on locomotion after traumatic brain injury. Archives of Physical Medicine Rehabilitation 2006; 87: 806 - 813) during the locomotor activities, subjects with TBI walked slower, had higher clearance margins and took longer to read during the Stroop tasks than healthy subjects. In general, subjects with TBI also showed deficits in executive functions and attention. Significant relationships were specifically observed between scores on Trail Making B and clearance margins for subjects with TBI, but not for healthy subjects. Alternatively, significant relationships between clinical scores on Stroop and dual task Stroop reading times were obtained for healthy subjects but not for subjects with TBI. Conclusions: These results suggest that measures of executive functioning and attention may be associated to locomotor behaviour in complex environments following a moderate to severe TBI.

J	De Beaumont, L; Brisson, B; Lassonde, M; Jolicoeur, P				De Beaumont, Louis; Brisson, Benoit; Lassonde, Maryse; Jolicoeur, Pierre			Long-term electrophysiological changes in athletes with a history of multiple concussions	BRAIN INJURY			English	Article						sports concussion; Event-Related Potentials (ERPs); P3; visual-spatial attention; N2pc	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; TRAUMATIC BRAIN-INJURY; CLOSED-HEAD-INJURY; VISUAL-SPATIAL ATTENTION; P300 LATENCY; PROCESSING DEFICITS; RESOURCE-ALLOCATION; CEREBRAL CONCUSSION; FOOTBALL PLAYERS; TASK	Primary objective: This event-related potentials study investigated the long- term effects associated with a history of one or multiple concussions on the N2pc and P3 components using a visual search oddball paradigm. Methods and procedure: A total of 47 university football players were assigned to three experimental groups based on prior concussion history: Athletes with a history of one concussion (single-concussion group); Athletes with two or more concussions (multi-concussion group); non-concussed athletic controls. The average post-concussion period was 31 months for athletes in the multi-concussion group and 59 months for the single-concussion group. Results: This study found significantly suppressed P3 amplitude in the multi-concussed athletes group compared to the single-concussion and non-concussed athletes even when using the time since the latest concussion as a covariate. Conclusion: This finding suggests that the multi- concussed athletes group showed long-lasting P3 amplitude suppression when compared with single- concussion or non-concussed athletes despite equivalent neuropsychological test scores and post-concussion symptoms self-reports. This pattern of results is important because it shows that 'old' concussions do not cause general or ubiquitous electrophysiological suppression. The specificity of the long-term effects of previous concussions to the P3, along with an intact N2pc response, suggests that further work may allow one to pinpoint the cognitive system that is specifically affected by multiple concussions.

In the vast majority of cases, this X-linked disorder is due to a CGG expansion in the 5' untranslated region of the fmr-1 gene and the resulting decreased expression of its associated protein, FMRP. FXS is characterized by a number of cognitive, behavioral, anatomical, and biological abnormalities. FXS provides a unique opportunity to study the consequence of mutation in a single gene on the development and proper functioning of the CNS. The current focus on the role of FMRP in neuronal maturation makes it timely to assemble the extant information on how reduced expression of the fmr-1 gene leads to neuronal dysmorphology. The purpose of this review is to summarize recent genetic, neuro anatomical, and behavioral studies of fragile X syndrome and to offer potential mechanisms to account for the pleiotropic phenotype of this disorder.

Source: A PubMed search of relevant article for the period 1985-2005 was undertaken, and bibliographies were scanned for additional sources. Principal findings: There is no substitute for objective neuromuscular monitoring; for research purposes, mechanomyography (MMG) is the gold standard; however, the most versatile method in the clinical setting is acceleromyography since it can be applied at various muscles and has a long track record of clinical utility. Kinemyography is valid to monitor recovery of neuromuscular transmission at the adductor pollicis muscle (AP), whereas phonomyography is easy to apply to various muscles and shows promising agreement with MMG. Monitoring of the corrugator supercilii muscle (CS) may be used to determine the earliest time for tracheal intubation as it reflects laryngeal relaxation better than monitoring at the AP Recovery of neuromuscular transmission is best monitored at the AP since it is the last muscle to recover from neuromuscular blockade (NMB). If train-of-four (TOF) stimulation is used, a TOF-ratio > 0.9 should be the target before awakening the patient. If surgery or the type of anesthesia necessitates NMB of a certain degree, e.g., TOF-ratio = 0.25, monitoring of muscles which best reflect the degree of NMB at the surgical site is preferable. Conclusion: Objective methods should be used to monitor neuromuscular function in clinical anesthesia. Acceleromyography offers the best compromise with respect to ease of use, practicality, versatility, precision and applicability at various muscles. The CS is the optimal muscle to determine the earliest time for intubation, e.g., for rapid sequence induction.

It presents in many different guises and circumstances in which therapy needs to be individualized. The Canadian Cardiovascular Society published a comprehensive set of recommendations in January 2006 on the diagnosis and management of heart failure, and the present update builds on those core recommendations. Based on feedback obtained through a national program of heart failure workshops during 2006, several topics were identified as priorities because of the challenges they pose to health care professionals. New evidence-based recommendations were developed using the structured approach for the review and assessment of evidence adopted and previously described by the Society. Specific recommendations and practical tips were written for the prevention of heart failure, the management of heart failure during intercurrent illness, the treatment Of acute heart failure, and the current and future roles of biomarkers in heart failure care. Specific clinical questions that are addressed include: which patients should be identified as being at high risk of developing heart failure and which interventions should be used? What complications can occur in heart failure patients during an intercurrent illness, how should these patients be monitored and which medications may require a close adjustment or discontinuation? What are the best therapeutic, both drug and nondrug, strategies for patients with acute heart failure? How can new biomarkers help in the treatment of heart failure, and when and how Should BNP be measured in heart failure patients? The goals of the present update are to translate best evidence into practice, to apply clinical wisdom where evidence for specific strategies is weaker, and to aid physicians and other health care providers to optimally treat heart failure patients to result in a measurable impact on patient health and clinical Outcomes in Canada.

Insights into the change in brain natriuretic peptide after ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI): why should it be better than baseline?	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY AND PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						natriuretic peptides; myocardial infarction; clinical trial	LEFT-VENTRICULAR FUNCTION; PROGNOSIS; EXTENT; ANGIOPLASTY; PREDICTORS; MORTALITY; EFFICACY; THERAPY; MARKERS; TRIAL	While baseline N-terminal brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) is useful in the prognosis of acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), it is unclear whether a relationship exists between serial NT-proBNP, reperfusion success, and prognosis. We prospectively defined a NT-proBNP analysis in the WEST (Which Early ST-elevation myocardial infarction Therapy) trial that enrolled 304 acute STEMI patients. NT-proBNP (pg/mL) was measured at baseline prior to treatment (n = 258) and 72 to 96 It (n = 247) and 30 days (n = 221) after treatment (ANT-proBNP = 72 h value - the baseline NT-proBNP). Reperfusion success was measured by ST-segment resolution at 180 min, infarct size by peak creatine kinase (CK) during the first 24 h, and QRS score at discharge (QRSd). The primary endpoint was a 30 day clinical composite. The ability of either baseline NT-proBNP or ANT-proBNP to predict the primary endpoint was compared using single-variable logistic regression and the c-statistic. Median (interquartile range) NT-proBNP in pg/mL was 87 (39-316) at baseline, 864 (338-1857) at 72 h, and 585 (264-1212) at 30 days. ST resolution was inversely correlated with Delta NT-proBNP (r = -0.23, p = 0.002) and 30 day NT-proBNP (30 day NT-proBNP. 1016, 828, and 397 for < 30%, 30%-70%, >= 70% STR, respectively, p < 0.001). Infarct size was correlated with Delta NT-proBNP by CK (r = 0.41, p < 0.001) and QRSd (r = 0.31, p < 0.001); the 30 day NT-proBNP relationship was similar for CK (r = 0.48, p < 0.001) and QRSd (p = 0.003). The baseline NT-proBNP was associated with an increased 30-day composite endpoint (Q1, 19%; Q2, 20%; Q3, 15%; Q4, 38%; p = 0.03 for trend) as was Delta NT-proBNP (Q1, 16%; Q2, 18%; Q3, 19%; Q4, 37%; p = 0.009 for trend). The c-statistic for baseline, 72 to 96 h, and Delta NT-proBNP was 0.59, 0.61, and 0.62 for the 30-day composite and 0.64, 0.62, and 0.62 for the 90-day composite, respectively. Delta NT-proBNP clearly predicts short-term adverse cardiac events and is superior to baseline NT-proBNP, but similar to the 72 to 96 h NT-proBNP in predicting clinical events after STEMI. This likely reflects the variability in NT-proBNP at presentation and the ability to integrate subsequent important physiologic sequelae of STEMI such as reperfusion and infarct size.

We sought to characterize the presence of the CXCR4/CXCL12 axis in five uveal melanoma (UM) cell lines in vitro. The ability of TN14003, a synthetic peptide inhibitor that targets the CXCR4 receptor complex, to inhibit this axis was also assessed. Methods: Immunocytochemistry was performed against CXCR4 to confirm expression of this chemokine receptor in all five UM cell lines. Flow cytometry was preformed to evaluate CXCR4 cell surface expression on all five UM cell lines. A proliferation assay was also used to test effects TN14003 would have on cellular proliferation. Inhibition of cellular migration by specifically inhibiting the CXCR4/CXCL12 axis with TN14003 was also investigated. The binding efficacy of TN14003 to the CXCR4 receptor was assessed through flow cytometric methods. Results: The CXCR4 receptor was present on all five UM cell lines. All five cell lines expressed different relative levels of surface CXCR4. TN14003 did not affect the proliferation of the five cell lines (p > 0.05). All cell lines migrated towards the chemokine CXCL12 at a level greater than the negative control (p < 0.05). All 5 cell lines pre-incubated with TN14003 prevented cellular migration towards chemokine CXCL12 (p < 0.01). TN14003 preferentially binds CXCR4 to native ligand CXCL12. Conclusion: Interfering with the CXCR4/CXCL12 axis, using TN14003 was shown to effectively down regulate UM cell migration in vitro. Knowing that UM expresses the CXCR4 receptor, these CXCR4+ cells may be less likely to colonize distant organs that secrete the CXCL12 ligand, if treated with an inhibitor that binds CXCR4. Further studies should be pursued in order to test TN14003 efficacy in vivo.

Although initially beneficial, excess fibrosis gradually results in alteration of left ventricular properties and cardiac dysfunction. Transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta(1)) is thought to be a primary mediator of fibrosis within the heart after injury. Currently, angiotensin II blockade is used to inhibit the actions of TGF-beta(1). However, recent studies indicate that angiotensin II blockade alone may not be sufficient to prevent TGF-beta(1)-induced fibrosis. Thus far, both in vivo and in vitro models have shown that direct TGF-beta(1) inhibition, NAPDH oxidase inhibitors, growth factors and hormonal treatment regimens targeting TGF-beta(1) may significantly reduce cardiac fibrosis after injury. This study attempts to underline these alternatives to angiotensin II blockade in combating TGF-beta(1)-induced cardiac dysfunction. Copyright (c) 2007 S.

This microcapsule system, consisting of an alginate core with a covalently cross-linked chitosan membrane, was formed via ionotropic gelation between calcium ions and alginate, followed by chitosan coating by polyelectrolyte complexation and covalent cross-linking of chitosan by naturally derived genipin. Results showed that, using this design concept and the three-step procedure, spherical GCAC microcapsules with improved membrane strength, suppressed capsular swelling, and suitable permeability can be prepared. The suitability of this novel membrane formulation for live cell encapsulation was evaluated, using bacterial Lactobacillus plantarum 80 (pCBH1) (LP80) and mammalian HepG2 as model cells. Results showed that capsular integrity and bacterial cell viability were sustained 6 mo postencapsulation, suggesting the feasibility of using this microcapsule formulation for live bacterial cell encapsulation. The metabolic activity of the encapsulated HepG2 was also investigated.

Pathogen recognition, mediated through an elaborate 'microbial sensing' system comprising the Toll-like and Nod-like receptor families results in the activation of caspase-1, which is a prerequisite for pathogen clearance. Tight regulation of caspase-1 is necessary to control the magnitude of the innate immune response and protect the organism from possible damaging effects such as sepsis. Recent findings from population studies and animal models of infectious diseases and sepsis have uncovered a role for full-length caspase-12 in blocking the inflammatory response initiated by caspase-1, thus predisposing the organism to severe sepsis and sepsis-related lethality. In this review, we re-examine the relationship among the Group I caspases, their known substrates and their proposed role in apoptosis. We further discuss their function in inflammation and bacterial clearance, with an emphasis on their regulatory mechanisms during the innate immune response.

As a class, opiates share a common profile of unwanted effects but there are also significant differences in ligand liability for producing these actions. A growing number of studies show that GPCRs may exist in multiple active states that differ in their signalling and regulatory properties and which may distinctively bind different agonists. In this review we summarize evidence supporting the existence of multiple active conformations for MORs and DORs, analyze information favouring the existence of ligand-specific receptor states and assess how ligand-selective efficacy may contribute to the production of longer lasting, better tolerated opiate analgesics.

The present study analyzed 63 babies' and children's (27 days to 5.5 years) cerebral responses to a pattern-reversal visual stimulation using high-density (128 electrodes) electrophysiological recordings. Developmental data were further compared with those of young adults (n = 16). Tremendous changes in pattern visual evoked potentials (pVEPs) morphology were observed between 7 and 24 months characterized by the emergence of negative components labeled "N70" and "N145" and the reduction of the P100 amplitude. The adult pattern of response appears from 24 months onward. Spectral density values show an increase of higher frequencies with age. Coherence values show a reduction between 3 and 23 months of age as well as a further increase toward adulthood between areas implicated in visual processing. These results are discussed in light of developmental features such as synaptogenesis, myelination, and neuronal networks refinement.

In this study, we examined training-related changes in cortical activity during a dual task requiring executive control. Two functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) sessions, one before training and one after training, were performed on both a control group and a training group. Using a region-of-interest analysis, we examined Time x Group and Time x Group x Condition interactions to isolate training-dependent changes in activation. We found that most regions involved in dual-task processing before training showed reductions in activation after training. Many of the decreases in activation were correlated with improved performance on the task. We also found an area in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex that showed an increase in activation for the training group for the dual-task condition, which was also correlated with improved performance. These results are discussed in relation to the efficacy of training protocols for modulating attention and executive functions, dual-task processing, and fMRI correlates of plasticity.

Furthermore, regional patterns of aromatase activity were correlated to a number of environmental factors such as exposure to environmental contaminants and parasitism. While aromatase activity was not detectable in the gonads of male and female fish with the assay used, fish of both genders revealed relatively great brain enzyme activities. As for most of the endocrine and reproductive parameters, with the exception of plasma testosterone (T), aromatase activities were significantly less in fish from a river stretch characterized by elevated exposures to organic contaminants and metals. Brain aromatase activity was positively and significantly correlated with plasma estradiol (E2) and MS in females, and showed a similar trend with plasma 11-ketotestosterone (11KT) and STI in males. No comparable trend occurred for T. This decrease of the reproductively relevant hormones 11KT and E2 may be indicative of a disruption of the last step in sex hormone synthesis, a hypothesis that was supported for E2 by the strong (R-2 = 0.78, p < 0.05) linear regression between aromatase activity and E2 in female bream. It is also hypothesized that the effects on brain aromatase activity were likely to be related to the disruption of other reproductive parameters including sexual maturity and expression of secondary sex characteristics. Although a number of factors such as exposure to pollutants and prevalence of the tapeworm Ligula intestinalis correlated with the suppression of aromatase activity, the exact causes for the regional decrease in brain aromatase activity remain unclear due to inconsistencies of these correlations between sampling events or gender.

Recent evidence demonstrating rhythmic clock gene expression in non-SCN tissues suggests that functional clocks exist outside the central circadian pacemaker of the brain. In this investigation, the nature of an oscillator in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) is evaluated by assessing clock gene expression throughout both a typical sleep/wake cycle (LD) and during a constant routine (CR). Six healthy men and women aged (mean +/- SEM) 23.7 +/- 1.6 yrs participated in this five-day investigation in temporal isolation. Core body temperature and plasma melatonin concentration were measured as markers of the central circadian pacemaker. The expression of HPER1, HPER2, and HBMAL1 was quantified in PBMCs sampled throughout an uninterrupted 72 h period. The core body temperature minimum and the midpoint of melatonin concentration measured during the CR occurred 2:17 +/- 0:20 and 3:24 +/- 0:09 h before habitual awakening, respectively, and were well aligned to the sleep/wake cycle. HPER1 and HPER2 expression in PBMCs demonstrated significant circadian rhythmicity that peaked early after wake-time and was comparable under LD and CR conditions. HBMAL1 expression was more variable, and peaked in the middle of the wake period under LD conditions and during the habitual sleep period under CR conditions. For the first time, bi-hourly sampling over three consecutive days is used to compare clock gene expression in a human peripheral oscillator under different sleep/wake conditions.

Reversal, or type 1, leprosy reactions (T1Rs) are acute immune episodes that occur in skin and/or nerves and are the leading cause of neurological impairment in patients with leprosy. T1Rs occur mainly in patients with borderline or multibacillary leprosy, but little is known about additional risk factors. Methods. We enrolled 337 Vietnamese patients with leprosy in our study, including 169 subjects who presented with T1Rs and 168 subjects with no history of T1Rs. A multivariate analysis was used to determine risk factors for T1R occurrence, time to T1R onset after leprosy diagnosis, and T1R sequelae after treatment. Results. Prevalence of T1Rs was estimated to be 29.1%. Multivariate analysis identified 3 clinical features of leprosy associated with T1R occurrence. Borderline leprosy subtype (odds ratio, 6.3[95% confidence interval, 2.9-13.7] vs. polar subtypes) was the major risk factor; 2 other risk factors were positive bacillary index and presence of 15 skin lesions. In addition, age at leprosy diagnosis was a strong independent risk factor for T1Rs ( odds ratio, 2.4[95% confidence interval, 1.3-4.4] for patients aged >= 15 years old vs. < 15 years old). We observed that T1Rs with neuritis occurred significantly earlier than pure skin-related T1Rs. Sequelae were present in 45.1% of patients who experienced T1Rs after treatment. The presence of a motor or sensory deficit at T1R onset was an independent risk factor for sequelae, as was the age at diagnosis of leprosy (odds ratio, 4.4[95% confidence interval, 1.7-11.6] for patients >= 20 years old vs. < 20 years old). Conclusion. In addition to specific clinical features of leprosy, age is an important risk factor for both T1R occurrence and sequelae after treatment for T1Rs.

Jaime			Meta-analysis of longitudinal studies	CLINICAL TRIALS			English	Article							CLINICAL-TRIALS; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; SUBTHALAMIC NUCLEUS; REGRESSION; STIMULATION	Background Longitudinal studies typically report estimates of the effect of a treatment or exposure at various times during the course of follow-up. Meta-analyses of these studies must account for correlations between effect estimates from the same study. Purpose To describe and contrast alternative approaches to handling correlations inherent to longitudinal effect estimates in meta-analyses. Methods. Linear mixed-effects models can account for correlations in a number of ways. We considered three alternatives: including study-specific random-effects, correlated time-specific random-effects or a general multivariate specification that also allows correlated within-study residuals. Data from a review of studies of the effect of deep-brain stimulation (DBS) in patients with Parkinson's disease are used to illustrate the application of these models. Results are contrasted with those from a naive meta-analysis in which the correlations are ignored. Results The data included 46 studies that yielded 82 estimates of the effect of DBS measured at 3, 6, 12 months or later after implantation of the stimulator. Models that accounted for correlations, particularly the full multivariate specification, provided better fit (lower AIC) and yielded slightly more precise effect estimates. This was in part due to a relatively extreme observation from a study that provided similar estimates at other times, which in the naive approach exerts greater influence since it is treated as an independent observation. Limitations Since the true values of the parameters are not known, it is impossible to confirm that estimates from the multivariate approach are necessarily more accurate. Conclusion Standard meta-analytic models can be readily extended to account for correlations between effects in longitudinal studies. These models may provide better fit and possibly more precise summary effect estimates.

Inhaled nitric oxide for respiratory failure in preterm infants	COCHRANE DATABASE OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS			English	Review						administration, inhalation; bronchopulmonary dysplasia [mortality; prevention & control]; cerebral hemorrhage [epidemiology]; incidence; infant, newborn; infant, premature; infant, premature, diseases [therapy]; nitric oxide [administration & dosage]; randomized controlled trials; respiratory insufficiency [therapy]; vasodilator agents [administration & dosage]; humans	RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIAL; DISTRESS-SYNDROME; PREMATURE-INFANTS; NEURODEVELOPMENTAL OUTCOMES; PULMONARY VASOCONSTRICTION; PLATELET-AGGREGATION; INHALATION; DISEASE; BIRTH; HYPERTENSION	Background Inhaled nitric oxide ( iNO) has been proven to be effective in term infants with hypoxic respiratory failure. The pathophysiology of respiratory failure, and the potential risks, differ substantially in preterm infants. Therefore, analysis of the efficacy and toxicities of iNO in infants born before 35 weeks is necessary. Objective To determine the effect of treatment with iNO on the rates of death, bronchopulmonary dysplasia ( BPD), intraventricular haemorrhage ( IVH), or neurodevelopmental disability in preterm newborn infants (< 35 weeks gestation) with respiratory disease. Search strategy Standard methods of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group were used. MEDLINE, EMBASE, Healthstar and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials ( CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library) were searched, using the following keywords: nitric oxide, clinical trial, and newborn covering the years from 1985 to 2006. In addition, the abstracts of the Pediatric Academic Societies were also searched. Selection criteria Randomised and quasi- randomised studies in preterm infants with respiratory disease that compared the effects of administration of iNO gas compared to control, with or without placebo are included in this review. Data collection and analysis Data regarding clinical outcomes including death, BPD ( defined as oxygen dependence at 36 weeks postmenstrual age), IVH, periventricular leukomalacia ( PVL), long term neurodevelopmental outcome and short term effects on oxygenation were excerpted from the trial reports by the investigators. Standard methods of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group were used. Two investigators extracted, assessed and coded separately all data for each study. Any disagreement was resolved by discussion. Main results Eleven randomised controlled trials of inhaled nitric oxide therapy in preterm infants were found. The trials have been grouped post hoc into three categories depending on the entry criteria; entry in the first three days of life based on oxygenation criteria ( Kinsella 1999; Hascoet 2004; INNOVO 2005; Van Meurs 2004; Mercier 1999; Dani 2006), routine use in intubated preterm babies ( Schreiber 2003; Kinsella 2006) and later enrolment based on an increased risk of BPD ( Subhedar 1997; Ballard 2006). The usefulness of the overall analyses was considered limited by the differing characteristics of the studies, and only subgroup analyses were performed. Trials of early rescue treatment of infants based on oxygenation criteria demonstrated no significant effect of iNO on mortality or BPD. The subgroup of studies with routine use of iNO in intubated preterm infants demonstrated a marginally significant reduction in the combined outcome of death or BPD [ typical RR 0.91 ( 95% CI 0.84, 0.99); typical RD - 0.06 ( 95% CI - 0.12, - 0.01)]. Later treatment with iNO based on the risk of BPD demonstrated no significant benefit for this outcome in our analysis. Studies of early rescue treatment with iNO demonstrated a trend toward increased risk of severe IVH, whereas the subgroup of studies with routine use in intubated preterm infants seems to show a reduction in the risk of having either a severe IVH or PVL [ typical RR 0.70 ( 95% CI 0.53, 0.91); typical RD - 0.07 ( 95% CI - 0.12, - 0.02)]. Later iNO treatment of infants at risk of BPD is given after the major risk period for IVH, and does not appear to lead to progression of old lesions. Two studies ( Schreiber 2003; INNOVO 2005) presented data on long term neurodevelopmental outcome. The early routine treatment study ( Schreiber 2003) showed an improved outcome at two years corrected age, while the rescue treatment study ( INNOVO 2005) showed no effect of iNO. Authors' conclusions iNO as rescue therapy for the very ill ventilated preterm infant does not appear to be effective and may increase the risk of severe IVH. Later use of iNO to prevent BPD also does not appear to be effective. Early routine use of iNO in mildly sick preterm infants may decrease serious brain injury and may improve survival without BPD. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings, to define groups most likely to benefit, and to describe long term outcomes.

Aldose reductase inhibitors for the treatment of diabetic polyneuropathy	COCHRANE DATABASE OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS			English	Review							PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHY; NERVE FUNCTION; CONTROLLED TRIAL; SORBINIL TREATMENT; MULTICENTER TRIAL; TOLRESTAT; PONALRESTAT; PLACEBO; COMPLICATIONS; METAANALYSIS	Background Polyneuropathy, a common complication of diabetes mellitus, causes pain and sensory and motor deficits in the limbs, and is also an important independent predictor of foot ulceration. Inhibiting the metabolism of glucose by the polyol pathway using aldose reductase inhibitors is a potential mechanism to slow or reverse the neuropathy's progression. Objectives To assess the effects of aldose reductase inhibitors on the progression of symptoms, signs or functional disability in diabetic polyneuropathy. Search strategy We searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Trials Register, MEDLINE (from January 1966 to May 2007), EMBASE (from January 1980 toMay 2007) and LILACS (from 1982 toMay 2007). We reviewed bibliographies of randomized trials identified, and contacted authors and experts in the field. Selection criteria We included randomized controlled trials comparing an aldose reductase inhibitor with control, and lasting at least six months. The primary outcome measure was change in neurological function, measured in various ways, including strength testing, sensory examination, and composite scores of neurological examination. Secondary outcome measures were nerve conduction studies, neuropathic symptoms, quality of life, occurrence of foot ulcers and adverse effects. Data collection and analysis Trials included in the review were selected and assessed independently by at least two of us. Methodological criteria and study results were recorded on data extraction forms. Main results Thirty-two randomized controlled trials meeting the inclusion criteria were identified. Many had significant methodological flaws. Change in neurological function, our primary outcome measure, was assessed in 29 trials, but sufficient data for meta-analysis were only available in 13 studies, involving 879 treated participants and 909 controls. There was no overall significant difference between the treated and control groups (SMD -0.25, 95% CI -0.56 to 0.05), although one subgroup analysis (four trials using tolrestat) favored treatment. A benefit for neuropathic symptoms was suggested by a group of trials using a dichotomized endpoint (improvement or not), but this was contradicted by another group of trials which measured symptoms on a continuous scale. There was no overall benefit on nerve conduction parameters (27 studies) or foot ulceration (one study). Quality of life was not assessed in any of the studies. While most adverse events were infrequent and minor, three compounds had dose limiting adverse events that lead to their withdrawal from human use: severe hypersensitivity reactions with sorbinil, elevation of creatinine with zenarestat, and alteration of liver function with tolrestat. Authors' conclusions We found no statistically significant difference between aldose reductase inhibitors and placebo in the treatment of diabetic polyneuropathy. Any future clinical trials of aldose reductase inhibitors should be restricted to compounds proven to have substantial biological or preclinical advantages over previously tested agents.

R. - a brain-damaged patient exhibiting severe amusia - processes implicitly musical structures. The task consisted in identifying one of two phonemes ( Experiment 1) or timbres ( Experiment 2) on the last chord of eight-chord sequences (i. e., target). The targets were harmonically related or less related to the prior chords. I. R. displayed harmonic priming effects: Phoneme and timbre identification was faster for related than for less related targets ( Experiments 1 and 2). However, I. R.'s explicit judgements of completion for the same sequences did not differ between related and less related contexts ( Experiment 3). Her impaired performance in explicit judgements was not due to general difficulties with task demands since she performed like controls for completion judgements on spoken sentences ( Experiment 4). The findings indicate that implicit knowledge of musical structures might remain intact and accessible, even when explicit judgements and overt recognition have been lost.

Most of these models, however, are based on experimental techniques that use simplified inputs of either single synaptic events or brief current injections. In this study, we used a more complex time-varying input to mimic the continuous barrage of synaptic input that neurons are likely to receive in vivo. Using dual whole-cell recordings of CA1 pyramidal neurons, we injected long-duration white-noise current into the dendrites. The amplitude variance of this stimulus was adjusted to produce either low subthreshold or high suprathreshold fluctuations of the somatic membrane potential. Somatic action potentials were produced in the high variance input condition. Applying a rigorous system-identification approach, we discovered that the neuronal input/output function was extremely well described by a model containing a linear bandpass filter followed by a nonlinear static-gain. Using computer models, we found that a range of voltage-dependent channel properties can readily account for the experimentally observed filtering in the neuronal input/output function. In addition, the bandpass signal processing of the neuronal input/output function was determined by the time-dependence of the channels. A simple active channel, however, could not account for the experimentally observed change in gain. These results suggest that nonlinear voltage- and time-dependent channels contribute to the linear filtering of the neuronal input/output function and that channel kinetics shape temporal signal processing in dendrites.

The force of gravity provides an allocentric frame of reference that defines one's motion relative to inertial (i.e., world-centered) space. However, movement in this environment also introduces particular motion detection problems as our internal linear accelerometers, the otolith organs, respond identically to either translational motion or changes in head orientation relative to gravity. According to physical principles, there exists an ideal solution to the problem of distinguishing between the two as long as the brain also has access to accurate internal estimates of angular velocity. Here, we illustrate how a nonlinear integrative neural network that receives sensory signals from the vestibular organs could be used to implement the required computations for inertial motion detection. The model predicts several distinct cell populations that are comparable with experimentally identified cell types and accounts for a number of previously unexplained characteristics of their responses. A key model prediction is the existence of cell populations that transform head-referenced rotational signals from the semicircular canals into spatially referenced estimates of head reorientation relative to gravity. This chapter provides an overview of how addressing the problem of inertial motion estimation from a computational standpoint has contributed to identifying the actual neuronal populations responsible for solving the tilt-translation ambiguity and has facilitated the interpretation of neural response properties.

We first discuss the known properties of the neural mechanisms controlling locomotion, with a focus on mammalian systems. The rhythm-generating properties of central pattern generators (CPGs) are discussed in light of results indicating that cycle characteristics may be preset by tonic drive to spinal interneuronal networks. We then describe neuromechanical simulations that have revealed some basic rules of interaction between CPGs, sensory-mediated switching mechanisms and the biomechanics of locomotor movements. We posit that the spinal CPG timer and the sensory-mediated switch operate in parallel, the former being driven primarily by descending inputs and the latter by the kinematics. The CPG timer produces extensor and flexor phase durations, which covary along specific lines in a plot of phase-versus cycle-duration. We coined the term "phase-duration characteristics" to describe such plots. Descending input from higher centers adjusts the operating points on the phase-duration characteristics according to anticipated biomechanical requirements. In well-predicted movements, CPG-generated phase durations closely match those required by the kinematics, minimizing the corrections in phase duration required of the sensory switching mechanism. We propose the term "neuromechanical tuning" to describe this process of matching the CPG to the kinematics.

In an attempt to clarify the answer, we review data showing that motor actions emerge from central resetting of the threshold position of appropriate body segments, i.e. the virtual position at which muscles are silent but deviations from it will elicit activity and resistive forces (threshold position control). The difference between the centrally-set threshold position and the sensory-signaled actual position is responsible for the activation of neuromuscular elements and interactions between them and the environment. These elements tend to diminish the evoked activity and interactions by minimizing the gap between the actual position and the threshold position (the principle of minimal interaction). Threshold control per se does not solve the redundancy problem: it only limits the set of possible actions. The principle of minimal interaction implies that the system relies on the natural capacity of neuromuscular elements to interact between themselves and with the environment to reduce this already restricted set to a unique action, thus solving the redundancy problem in motor control. This theoretical framework appears to be helpful in the explanation of the control and production of a variety of actions (reaching movements, specification of different hand configurations, grip force generation, and whole-body movements such as sit-to-stand or walking). Experimental tests of this theory are provided. The prediction that several types of neurons specify referent control variables for motor actions may be tested in future studies. The theory may also be advanced by applying the notion of threshold control to perception and cognition.

We suggest here a modular network architecture with attractor dynamics that can compute the time-varying signals that are presumably required to control arm movements. The architecture is composed of several linked modules and implements the joint torque control of a planar biomechanical model of the arm, in the presence of external dynamic perturbations. The meta-network is robust to noise and to the unreliable availability of some signals and can provide feedback correction for unexpected external perturbations.	[Krouchev, N. I.; Kalaska, J.

Here, an alternative framework is described, which focuses on interactive behavior and treats it as a continuous competition between representations of currently available potential actions. This suggests a neural organization consisting of two parallel systems: a system for action specification, which uses sensory information to represent currently available potential actions, and a system for action selection, which involves attentional and decisional mechanisms which determine the action that will be performed. It is proposed that neural processing occurs through two waves of activation: an early wave which specifies several potential actions and a later wave of biasing influences which selects one action for execution. A computational model of decision making is described within the context of this proposal, and simulations of neural and behavioral phenomena are presented.

This chapter focuses on what is required for the learning of complex behaviors. We believe it involves the learning of highly varying functions, in a mathematical sense. We bring forward two types of arguments which convey the message that many currently popular machine learning approaches to learning flexible functions have fundamental limitations that render them inappropriate for learning highly varying functions. The first issue concerns the representation of such functions with what we call shallow model architectures. We discuss limitations of shallow architectures, such as so-called kernel machines, boosting algorithms, and one-hidden-layer artificial neural networks. The second issue is more focused and concerns kernel machines with a local kernel (the type used most often in practice) that act like a collection of template-matching units. We present mathematical results on such computational architectures showing that they have a limitation similar to those already proved for older non-parametric methods, and connected to the so-called curse of dimensionality. Though it has long been believed that efficient learning in deep architectures is difficult, recently proposed computational principles for learning in deep architectures may offer a breakthrough.

This paper employs a novel technique, known as locally linear embedding (LLE), for solving the face detection problem. The LLE method performs dimensionality reduction on data for learning and classification purposes. Proposed by Roweis and Saul, the intent of LLE is to determine a locally linear fit so that each data point can be represented by a linear combination of its closest neighbors. The first objective of this research is to apply the LLE algorithm to 2D facial images to obtain their representation in a sub-space under the specific conditions stated above. The low-dimensional data are then used to train support vector machine (SVM) classifiers to label windows in images as being either face or non-face. Six different databases of cropped facial images, corresponding to variations in head rotation, illumination, facial expression, occlusion and aging, were used to train and test the classifiers. The second objective was to evaluate the feasibility of using the combined efficacy of the six SVM classifiers in a two-stage face detection approach. Experimental results obtained demonstrated that the performance of the proposed method was similar and sometimes better when compared to other face detection methods, thus indicating a viable and accurate technique.

A systematic comparison of flat and standard cascade-correlation using a student-teacher network approximation task	CONNECTION SCIENCE			English	Article						neural network architectures; cascade; correlation; network depth; connectivity; function approximation	LEARNING ALGORITHMS; NEURAL NETWORKS; PERFORMANCE; ARCHITECTURE; KNOWLEDGE	Cascade-correlation (cascor) networks grow by recruiting hidden units to adjust their computational power to the task being learned. The standard cascor algorithm recruits each hidden unit on a new layer, creating deep networks. In contrast, the flat cascor variant adds all recruited hidden units on a single hidden layer. Student-teacher network approximation tasks were used to investigate the ability of flat and standard cascor networks to learn the input-output mapping of other, randomly initialized flat and standard cascor networks. For low-complexity approximation tasks, there was no significant performance difference between flat and standard student networks. Contrary to the common belief that standard cascor does not generalize well due to cascading weights creating deep networks, we found that both standard and flat cascor generalized well on problems of varying complexity. On high-complexity tasks, flat cascor networks had fewer connection weights and learned with less computational cost than standard networks did.

The two fACEs of the tissue renin-angiotensin systems: Implication in cardiovascular diseases	CURRENT PHARMACEUTICAL DESIGN			English	Review							CONVERTING ENZYME ACE; SPONTANEOUSLY HYPERTENSIVE-RATS; LEFT-VENTRICULAR HYPERTROPHY; ACUTE-RESPIRATORY-SYNDROME; FAILING HUMAN HEART; MESSENGER-RNA EXPRESSION; ELEVATED BLOOD-PRESSURE; SARS-COV RECEPTOR; CARDIAC-HYPERTROPHY; MYOCARDIAL-INFARCTION	The implication of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in the regulation of the cardiovascular system has been well known for many years. Accordingly, many pharmaceutical inhibitors have been developed to treat several pathologies, like hypertension and heart failure, and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) became one of the major target in the treatment of these cardiovascular diseases. In the last decade however, it has become apparent that the classical view of the RAS was not quite accurate. For instance, ACE has been shown to work not only by generating angiotensin-II but also by interacting with receptors outside the renin-angiotensin system. Moreover, it has been shown that many local RAS are present in different tissues, such as the heart, brain, kidney and vasculature. However, in the past, it was impossible to determine the role of these local systems as they were pharmacologically indistinguishable from the systemic RAS. Hence, in recent years, the development of transgenic animals has allowed us to determine that these local systems are implicated in the roles that had been originally attributed exclusively to the systemic action of the RAS. However, with almost 30% of the medicated hypertensive patients harboring an uncontrolled blood pressure, a need for new drugs and new targets appears necessary. With the new century came the discovery of a new homolog of ACE, called ACE2, and early studies suggest that it may play a pivotal role in the RAS by controlling the balance between the vasoconstrictor effects of angiotensin-II and the valsodilatory properties of the angiotensin(1-7) peptide. Like ACE, ACE2 appears to hydrolyze peptides not related with the RAS and the enzyme has also been identified as a receptor for the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus. Although the tissue localization of ACE2 was originally though to be very restricted, new studies have emerged showing a more widespread distribution. Therefore, the whole dynamics of the RAS has to be re-evaluated in light of this new information. In this review, we will compare the structures, distributions and properties of ACE and its new homologue in the context of cardiovascular function, focusing on the autocrine/paracrine cardiac and brain renin-angiotensin systems and we will present recent data from the literature and our laboratory offering a new perspective on this potential target for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases.

Mechanism of psychoactive drug action in the brain: Simulation modeling of GABA(A) receptor interactions at non-equilibrium conditions	CURRENT PHARMACEUTICAL DESIGN			English	Review							NEOCORTICAL PYRAMIDAL NEURONS; MINIATURE GABAERGIC CURRENTS; RAT HIPPOCAMPAL SLICE; SYNAPTIC-TRANSMISSION; CEREBELLAR SYNAPSE; TRANSMITTER CONCENTRATION; A RECEPTORS; IN-VIVO; OSCILLATIONS; NOISE	Synaptic transmission requires that. the binding of the transmitter to the receptor to occur under rapidly changing transmitter levels. and this binding interaction is unlikely to be at equilibrium. We have sought to numerically solve for binding kinetics using ordinary differential equations and simultaneous difference equations for use in stochastic conditions. The reaction scheme of GABA interacting with the ligand-gated ion-channel demonstrates numerical stiffness. Implicit methods (Backward Euler, ode23s) performed orders of magnitude better than explicit methods (Forward Euler, odc23, RK4, odc45) in terms of step size required tor stability. number of'steps and cpu time. Interestingly, upon solving the system of 8 ordinary differential equations for the GABA reaction scheme we observed the existence of low dimensional invariant manifolds that may have important consequences for information processing in synapses. We also describe a mathematical approach that models complex receptor interactions in which the timing and amplitude of transmitter release are noisy. Exact solutions for simple bimolecular interactions that include stoichiometric interactions and receptor transitions can be used to model complex reaction schemes. We used the difference method to investigate the information processing capabilities of GABA(A) receptors and to predict how pharmacological agents may modify these properties. Initial simulations using a model for licterosynaptic regulation shows that signal to noise ratios can be decreased in the presence of background presynaptic activity both in the presence and absence of chlorpromazine. These types of simulations provide a platform for investigating the effect of psycho-active drugs on complex responses of transmitter-receptor interactions in noisy cellular environments such as the synapse. Understanding this process of transinitter-receptor interactions may be useful in the development of more specific and highly targeted modes of action.

Methods: The protocol was an open-label study of 30 AD subjects ( mean age 74 years; education 11 years; Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) 23 of 30) beginning a 6-month course of treatment with donepezil. Global response to treatment was determined using a combination algorithm based on changes over 6 months in the ADAS-cog, MMSE and CIBIC. In addition, a set of neuropsychological and experimental cognitive tests designed to test five domains of cognition were administered before beginning therapy in order to determine which domain of testing would be predictive to response to treatment. The tests examined attention, short-term and working memory, learning and memory, visuo-spatial motor skills, and lexical-semantic knowledge. Results: Eighteen of the thirty subjects were rated as having responded ( stable or improved scores on the combination algorithm) to the therapy. Responders were significantly less impaired prior to treatment on the following tests: the Clock Drawing Test, a Visual-Spatial Motor Tracking Test, and the Boston Picture Naming Test. No significant initial group differences were noted on the other neuropsychological or experimental cognitive measures. Conclusion: The tests that most reliably predicted response to donepezil in AD subjects were in the domains of visual-spatial motor abilities and lexical-semantic functioning. Copyright (c) 2007 S.

Gross anatomy of the corpus callosum in Alzheimer's disease: regions of degeneration and their neuropsychological correlates	DEMENTIA AND GERIATRIC COGNITIVE DISORDERS			English	Article						Alzheimer's disease; corpus callosum; neuropsychology; white matter; morphology	MENTAL DETERIORATION; SEX-DIFFERENCES; NORMATIVE DATA; ATROPHY; NEUROPATHOLOGY; SEGMENTATION; MORPHOMETRY; PROGRESSION; MRI	Background/Aims: Differences in the gross shape of the corpus callosum (CC) and its subregional areas were investigated on brain MRI of patients with probable Alzheimer's disease (AD) and age- and gender-matched healthy normal control subjects. The AD patients differed from the normal control subjects in terms of a more convex shape and a reduced area of the CC. Methods: As for the comparisons of the subregional areas of the CC, we adapted a splitting method which takes into account the modification of the global shape of the CC, and we implemented it by normalizing the CC, to avoid the bias introduced by the observed callosal shape variability. Results: The application of this method unveiled that the regional CC reductions were located in the anterior and posterior third of the CC, i.e. where small myelinated fibers are more frequent. None of the neuropsychological scores collected at the time of the MRI investigation of AD could predict a regional and/or overall callosal area reduction. The only measure that correlated with area of the isthmus of the CC was the MMSE that was administered to all participants. Conclusions: This latter result may be used as an in vivo indicator of the progress of neocortical disintegration in AD. Copyright (C) 2007 S. Karger AG, Basel.

In this study, we aimed to provide further evidence for the construct validity of the frontal behavioural inventory ( FBI) and assess its utility in differentiating FTLD patients from other groups using data from the Canadian Collaborative Cohort of Related Dementias ( ACCORD) study. Method: Baseline scores on the FBI and neuropsychiatric inventory (NPI) were compared among several clinical groups (n = 177). Results: The FBI discriminated a higher percentage of FTLD patients ( > 75% correct classification) from Alzheimer's disease and other groups compared to the NPI (54.2%). Conclusion: This study provides good evidence for convergent validity between the FBI and NPI (r = 0.72), indicating that both measures capture similar psychopathology in this nationwide cohort.

The hypothesis that bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) promote ganglionation by regulating neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) polysialylation was tested. Transcripts encoding the sialyltransferases, ST8Sia IV (PST) and ST8Sia 11 (STX), which polysialylate NCAM, were detectable in fetal rat gut by E12 but were downregulated postnatally. PSA-NCAM-immunoreactive neuron numbers, but not those of NCAM, were developmentally regulated similarly. Circular smooth muscle was transiently (E16-20) PSA-NCAM-immunoreactive when it is traversed by migrating precursors of submucosal neurons. Neurons developing in vitro from crest-derived cells immunoselected at E12 with antibodies to p75(NTR) expressed NCAM and PSA-NCAM. BMP-4 promoted neuronal NCAM polysialylation and clustering. N-butanoylmannosamine, which blocks NCAM polysialylation, but not N-propanoylmannosamine, which does not, interfered with BMP-4-induced neuronal clustering. Observations suggest that BMP signaling enhances NCAM polysialylation, which allows precursors to migrate and form ganglionic aggregates during the remodeling of the developing ENS.

Management of different types of pain (acute, postoperative, inflammatory, neuropathic or cancer) is the most frequent issue encountered by clinicians and pharmacological therapy is the first line of approach for the treatment of pain. This review presents and discusses recent clinical advances regarding both the improvements in delivery of analgesic drugs and improvements in the design of analgesic molecules. The new modalities of administration of analgesics used in the clinic are reviewed, including skin patches, oral and mucosal sprays, transdermal delivery systems and intranasal administration. New insights are then presented on standard drugs used to relieve pain, such as opioids (including tramadol), NSAIDs including selective cyclo-oxygenase-2 inhibitors, paracetamol (acetaminophen), local anaesthetics and adjuvant analgesics such as antidepressants, anticonvulsants (gabapentin and pregabalin), cannabinoids, ketamine and others (e.g. nefopam). Although the understanding of pain mechanisms has improved significantly recently, much more is yet to be discovered and awaited. Broadening of our knowledge is needed to improve basic and clinical research in this field in order to better alleviate pain in millions of people.

J	Hanna, AM; Ural, D; Saygili, G				Hanna, Adel M.; Ural, Derin; Saygili, Gokhan			Evaluation of liquefaction potential of soil deposits using artificial neural networks	ENGINEERING COMPUTATIONS			English	Article						phase transformations; regression analysis; neural networks; earthquakes; soil testing	CONE PENETRATION TEST; RESISTANCE; CPT	Purpose - In the literature, several empirical methods can be found to predict the occurrence of nonlinear soil liquefaction in soil layers. These methods are limited to the seismic conditions and the parameters used in developing the model. This paper seeks to present General Regression Neural Network (GRNN) model that addresses the collective knowledge built in simplified procedure. Design/methodology/approach - The GRNN model incorporates the soil and seismic parameters of the region. It was developed in four phases; identification, collection, implementation, and verification. The data used consisted of 3,895 case records, mostly from the cone penetration test (CPT) results produced from the two major earthquakes that took place in Turkey and Taiwan in 1999. The case records were divided randomly into training, testing and validation datasets. Soil liquefaction decision in terms of seismic demand and seismic capacity is determined by the stress-based method and strain-based method, and further tested with the well-known Chinese criteria. Findings - The results produced by the proposed GRNN model explore effectively the complex relationship between the soil and seismic input parameters and further forecast the liquefaction potential with an overall success ratio of 94 percent. Liquefaction decisions were further validated by the SPT, confirming the viability of the SPT-to-CPT data conversion, which is the main limitation of most of the simplified methods.

We undertook a pilot study in a community in Quebec (Canada) where naturally occurring high Mn levels were present in the public water system. Our objective was to test the hypothesis that greater exposure to Mn via drinking water would be reflected in higher Mn content in hair which, in turn, would be associated with increased level of hyperactive behaviors. METHODS: Forty-six children participated in the study, 24 boys and 22 girls, 6-15 years of age (median, 11 years). Their homes received water from one of two wells M with different Mn concentrations: W1: mean 6 10 mu g/L; W2: mean 160 mu g/L. The Revised Conners' Rating Scale for parents (CPRS-R) and for teachers (CTRS-R) were administered, providing T-scores on the following subscales: Oppositional, Hyperactivity, Cognitive Problems/Inattention, and ADHD Index. RESULTS: Children whose houses were supplied by W1 had higher hair Mn (MnH) than those supplied by W2 (mean 6.2 +/- 4.7 mu g/g vs. 3.3 +/- 3.0 mu g/g, p = 0.025). MnH was significantly associated with T-scores on the CTRS-R Oppositional (p = 0.020) and Hyperactivity (p = 0.002) subscales, after adjustment for age, sex, and income. All children with Oppositional and Hyperactivity T-scores >= 65 had MnH > 3.0 mu g/g. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this pilot study are sufficiently compelling to warrant more extensive investigations into the risks of Mn exposure in drinking water.

Activity-dependent gene expression correlates with interictal spiking in human neocortical epilepsy	EPILEPSIA			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	8th Workshop on Neurobiology of Epilepsy	AUG 24-26, 2005	Villiers le Mahieu, FRANCE			interictal; gene expression; human epilepsy; activity	TEMPORAL-LOBE EPILEPSY; RECURRENT COLLATERAL SYNAPSES; TRANSCRIPTION FACTORS; EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY; HIPPOCAMPAL-NEURONS; EEG; NETWORKS; PREDICTION; SEIZURES; SURGERY	Interictal spikes are hallmarks of epileptic neocortex that are used commonly in both EEG and electrocorticography (ECoG) to localize epileptic brain regions. Despite their prevalence, the exact relationship between interictal spiking and the molecular pathways that drive the production and propagation of seizures is not known. We have recently identified a common group of genes induced in human epileptic foci, including EGR1, EGR2, c-fos, and MKP-3. We found that the expression levels of these genes correlate precisely with the frequency of interictal activity and can thus serve as markers of epileptic activity. Here, we explore this further by comparing the expression of these genes within human epileptic neocortex to both ictal and specific electrical parameters of interictal spiking from subdural recordings prior to surgical resection in order to determine the electrical properties of the human neocortex that correlate best to the expression of these genes. Seizure frequency as well as quantitative electrophysiological parameters of interictal spikes including frequency, amplitude, duration, and area were calculated at each electrode channel and compared to quantitative real-time RT-PCR measurements of four activity-dependent genes (c-fos, EGR1, EGR2, and MKP-3) in the underlying neocortical tissue. Local neocortical regions of seizure onset had consistently higher spike firing frequencies and higher spike amplitudes compared to nearby "control" cortex. In contrast, spike duration was not significantly different between these two areas. There was no relationship observed between seizure frequency and the expression levels of activity-dependent genes for the patients examined in this study. However, within each patient, there were highly significant correlations between the expression of three of these genes (c-fos, EGR1, EGR2) and the frequency, amplitude, and total area of the interictal spikes at individual electrodes. We conclude that interictal spiking is closely associated with the expression of a group of activity-dependent transcription factors in neocortical human epilepsy. Since there was little correlation between gene expression and seizure frequency, our results suggest that interictal spiking is a stronger driving force behind these activity-dependent gene changes and may thus participate in the development and maintenance of the abnormal neuronal hyperactivity seen in human epileptic neocortex.

J	Lacoste, A; Eck, D				Lacoste, Alexandre; Eck, Douglas			A supervised classification algorithm for note onset detection	EURASIP JOURNAL ON ADVANCES IN SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article							ACOUSTIC MUSICAL SIGNALS; TEMPO; BEAT; TRANSFORM; TRACKING; METER	This paper presents a novel approach to detecting onsets in music audio files. We use a supervised learning algorithm to classify spectrogram frames extracted from digital audio as being onsets or nononsets. Frames classified as onsets are then treated with a simple peak-picking algorithm based on amoving average. We present two versions of this approach. The first version uses a single neural network classifier. The second version combines the predictions of several networks trained using different hyperparameters. We describe the details of the algorithm and summarize the performance of both variants on several datasets. We also examine our choice of hyperparameters by describing results of cross-validation experiments done on a custom dataset. We conclude that a supervised learning approach to note onset detection performs well and warrants further investigation. Copyright (c) 2007 Hindawi Publishing Corporation. All rights reserved.

Auditory processing in a patient with a unilateral lesion of the inferior colliculus	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						case study; psychophysical assessments; unilateral lesion	MASKING-LEVEL DIFFERENCES; SOUND LOCALIZATION; ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL EVIDENCE; CRITICAL BAND; DISORDERS; HEARING; NUCLEUS; HUMANS; CAT	The role of the inferior colliculus (IC) in human auditory processing is still poorly understood. We report here the results obtained with a 12-year-old boy (FX) who suffered a very circumscribed lesion of the right IC without additional neurological damage. The child underwent an extensive battery of psychophysical hearing tests. Results revealed normal peripheral auditory functioning, bilaterally. Furthermore, masking-level differences and frequency-pattern recognition were normal for each ear. When the right ear was stimulated, behavioural tests assessing central auditory processing yielded normal results. However, when the left ear was stimulated, speech recognition in the presence of a competing ipsilateral signal and duration-pattern recognition were impaired. Similarly, performance on two dichotic speech recognition tests was poor when the target stimulus was presented in the left and the competing signal in the right ear. Finally, sound-source localization in space was deficient for speakers located on the side contralateral to the lesion. The pattern of results suggests that auditory functions such as recognition of low-redundancy speech presented monaurally, recognition of tone duration patterns, binaural separation and integration, as well as sound-source localization in space, depend on the integrity of the bilateral auditory pathways at the IC level.

Environmental factors such as resource availability play an important role in modulating parental investment strategies with subsequent effects on the offspring. Thus, we examined the interaction between foraging demand and biparental care on hippocampal development and novel object recognition in the monogamous, biparental California mouse. We characterized biparental behavior for 15 days in families exposed to either control (ad libitum feeding) or a high-foraging demand across the weaning period. Adult male offspring were then tested in the open field, and for novel object and place recognition, as well as for hippocampal synaptic density and the expression of genes encoding for subunits of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor complex, and the postsynaptic density (PSD)-95 scaffolding protein. Under high-foraging demand, the mothers' body weight was decreased at weaning and fathers spent significantly less time in contact with pups. Offspring reared under high-foraging demand weighed less at weaning and, as adults, were more fearful in the open field and showed profound deficits in both novel object and place recognition. While synaptic density and NR1 mRNA expression were unaffected, offspring reared under high-foraging demand showed increased NR2A and decreased NR2B mRNA expression. Further, PSD-95 protein expression was decreased in mice reared under high-foraging demand. Together, the results suggest that resource availability affects biparental investment strategies, with subsequent effects on hippocampal development and novel object recognition in the offspring.

The effect of early musical training on adult motor performance: evidence for a sensitive period in motor learning	EXPERIMENTAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article							WHITE-MATTER DEVELOPMENT; AUDITORY-CORTEX; ABSOLUTE PITCH; TEMPORAL PATTERNS; BRAIN-DEVELOPMENT; HESCHLS GYRUS; MUSICIANS; CHILDREN; CEREBELLUM; PLASTICITY	Developmental changes in the human brain coincide with and underlie changes in a wide range of motor and cognitive abilities. Neuroimaging studies have shown that musical training can result in structural and functional plasticity in the brains of musicians, and that this plasticity is greater for those who begin training early in life. However, previous studies have not controlled for differences between early-trained (ET) and late-trained (LT) musicians in the total number of years of musical training and experience. In the present experiment, we tested musicians who began training before and after the age of 7 on learning of a timed motor sequence task. The groups were matched for years of musical experience, years of formal training and hours of current practice. Results showed that ET musicians performed better than LT musicians, and that this performance advantage persisted after 5 days of practice. Performance differences were greatest for a measure of response synchronization, suggesting that early training has its greatest effect on neural systems involved in sensorimotor integration and timing. These findings support the idea that there may be a sensitive period in childhood where enriched motor training through musical practice results in long-lasting benefits for performance later in life. These results are also consistent with the results of studies showing structural changes in motor-related regions of the brain in musicians that are specifically related to training early in life.

However, despite ( 1) the acknowledged demonstration of the motor, perceptual and cognitive contributions of the cerebellum and ( 2) the growing number of neuroimaging studies allowing for the exploration of the neurobiological bases of language abilities, only a small number of neuroimaging studies focus on the cerebellar contribution to language. Aims: To look for unreported cerebellar activations in the neuroimaging literature for language, in order to systematically describe the unreported or otherwise unnoticed cerebellar activations associated with language tasks. Methods: A recent review paper by Demonet et al. [Physiol Rev 2005; 85: 49-95] was used as a base in order to investigate the literature on the neuroimaging of language abilities. Results: Of the 450 papers cited in this review, 100 articles were directly related to single-word processing, of which only 34 reported cerebellum activations. Conclusion: The full integration of the cerebellum in the network allowing for language and communication is still to come, as very few neuroimaging studies do report cerebellar activations underlying the processing of words.

A growing body of research is starting to focus on genetic polymorphism as an individual difference factor to explain the observed heterogeneity in cognitive function. While the functional mechanism is still under investigation, polymorphism of the 5-HT(2A) receptor gene (-1438A/G) has been linked to certain behavioral and physiological outcomes, including cortisol secretion, the expression of certain personality traits, and memory performance. It was the goal of the present study to investigate the association between the -1438A/G polymorphism and stress hormone secretion, stress-related psychological measures, and cognitive performance in a group of adults between the ages of 50 and 65. To examine these associations, 101 middle-aged adults were recruited, completed a battery of psychological questionnaires and were administered a battery of cognitive tasks that assess frontal lobe and hippocampal function. Basal and stress-reactive salivary cortisol levels were collected, at home and in the laboratory. Analyses on psychological measures showed that participants with the GG genotype reported significantly higher levels of neuroticism compared to the AG group and higher levels of depression and more emotion-based coping strategies compared to both the AG and AA group. In terms of cortisol secretion, the AA genotype was related to a significantly higher awakening cortisol response (ACR) compared to the AG and GG group and the GG genotype group displayed a greater increase in cortisol secretion following a psychosocial stressor compared to the two other groups. On measures of cognitive performance, the AA genotype group performed significantly better on a test of declarative memory and selective attention compared to the other two groups. Together, these results suggest that carriers of the GG genotype are more susceptible to low mood and display a greater potential for an overactive stress system, which may influence cognitive function in later years.

A genetic component determines the brain of the individuals, a machine learner architecture, which is then used to transmit knowledge. The a priori information is kept down to a minimum. All species are initially indistinguishable and agents can only find each other by chance at the beginning. Differentiation occurs as a result of the interactions between the genetic and the knowledge parts. Restricted availability of different symbolic values forces the emergence of more elaborated recognition patterns. The sequences that form as the result Of this Simulation cannot be related to either the genetic or the environmental initial conditions. A Baldwin effect is observed where parts of the machine learning, architecture adapts to accommodate for each species dominant Sequence, which further stabilizes it. Mutually infertile species, limited learning capacities. and a restricted imperfect communication are thus all that is needed for the emergence of stable recognition patterns.

The membrane protein Vangl2 belongs to a highly conserved group of proteins that regulate planar polarity in certain epithelia, and that are also important for convergent extension movements during gastrulation and neurulation. A specific anti-Vangl2 antiserum was produced and used to examine the tissue, cell type, and sub-cellular localization of Vangl2 during embryogenesis. Vangl2 protein is expressed at high levels in the neural tube and shows a dynamic expression profile during neurulation. After neural tube closure, robust Vangl2 staining is detected in several neural and neurosensory tissues, including cerebral cortex, dorsal root ganglia, olfactory epithelium, retina, mechanosensory hair cells of the cochlea, and optic nerve. Vangl2 is also expressed during organogenesis in a number of tubular epithelia, including the bronchial tree, intestinal crypt/villus axis, and renal tubular segments derived from ureteric bud and from metanephric mesenchyme. Examination of Vangl2 localization in the neural tubes and cochleas of the normal and Lp/Lp embryos shows disruption of normal membrane localization of Vangl2 in independent alleles at Lp (Lp, Lp(m1Jus)) as well as overall decrease in the expression level.

Depression in burn reconstruction patients: symptom prevalence and association with body image dissatisfaction and physical function	GENERAL HOSPITAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						burn injury; reconstruction; depression; screening	SPINAL-CORD-INJURY; QUALITY-OF-LIFE; TRAUMATIC BRAIN-INJURY; MAJOR DEPRESSION; BREAST RECONSTRUCTION; CLINICAL-RESEARCH; COSMETIC SURGERY; CONTROLLED-TRIAL; FLUOXETINE; WOMEN	Objective: This study investigated the prevalence and the clinical correlates of symptoms of depression among burn reconstruction patients. Method: A sample of 224 burn reconstruction patients completed the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), the SF-36 Health Survey and the Satisfaction with Appearance Scale. Results: The prevalence of at least mild to moderate symptoms of depression (BDI >= 10) was 46%. Female patients were disproportionately represented in this burn reconstruction population (46%) compared to all survivors from the burn center (29%; P < .001) and compared to a national sample of burn survivors (27%; P < .001). Compared to males, female patients presented for consultation much longer after a burn injury (P < .001), tended to have smaller burns (P = .06) and were less likely to have facial burns (P = .08). Depressive symptoms were largely predicted by body image dissatisfaction (beta = .58; P < .001), with additional variance predicted by physical function (beta = -.13; P = .07). The effect of patient and burn injury variables on depressive symptoms was mediated by body image dissatisfaction and physical function. Conclusion: The high prevalence of significant symptoms of depression in burn reconstruction patients and their relationship with body image suggest the importance of the routine psychological screening of patients seeking reconstruction services.

In such cases the brain is bisexual: Each member of the species develops male and female sexual organs and retains the capacity to express both male and female patterns of reproductive behavior. Members of such species can reproduce socially or alone. Mammals and many other species reproduce both sexually and socially, which requires an active process of sexual differentiation of reproductive organs and brain. The primary theme of this chapter is simply that this process admits to variation and thus individual differences in gender-specific patterns of reproductive function. The focus on this chapter is the often neglected variation in the development of reproductive function in the female mammal. The basic premise is that evolution has not defined any single, optimal reproductive phenotype, but rather encourages plasticity in specific reproductive traits among same sex members of the species that are derived from variations in the quality of the prevailing environment during development that are mediated by alterations in parent-offspring interactions. Thus, the variations in parental care that define the reproductive phenotype of the offspring are influenced by the quality of the environment (i.e., nutrient availability, predation, infection, population density, and so on).

Under most conditions fibroblasts do not express progranulin in vivo, however its expression is activated following wounding. We hypothesised that progranulin is part of a fibroblast stress response. Fibroblasts in culture were exposed to two physiologically and clinically relevant microenvironmental stresses; hypoxia (1% oxygen) and acidosis, both of which increase progranulin expression. The greatest increases occurred when hypoxia and acidosis were combined. Increased progranulin expression is not a direct response to apoptosis since it occurred under conditions of pH and hypoxia under which cell viability remained high. Low concentrations of progranulin (2 nM) protected fibroblasts from apoptosis induced by extreme acidosis (pH 5.0 and 4.0). We propose that progranulin is part of a fibroblast stress response and is cytoprotective to acidotic stress.

Field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) evoked by stimulation of the piriform (olfactory) cortex were recorded in the medial entorhinal cortex during behaviors associated with theta activity (active mobility) and were compared with those recorded during nontheta behaviors (awake immobility and slow wave sleep). Synaptic responses were smaller during behavioral activity than during awake immobility and sleep, and responses recorded during movement were largest during the negative phase of the theta rhythm. Systemic administration of cholinergic agonists reduced the amplitude of fEPSPs, and the muscarinic receptor blocker scopolamine strongly enhanced fEPSPs, suggesting that the theta-related suppression of fEPSPs is mediated in part by cholinergic inputs. The reduction in fEPSPs was investigated using in vitro intracellular recordings of EPSPs in Layer II neurons evoked by stimulation of Layer I afferents. Constant bath application of the muscarinic agonist carbachol depolarized membrane potential and suppressed EPSP amplitude in Layer II neurons. The suppression of EPSPs was not associated with a substantial change in input resistance, and could not be accounted for by a depolarization-induced reduction in driving force on the EPSP. The GABA(A) receptor-blocker bicuculline (50 mu M) did not prevent the cholinergic suppression of EPSPs, suggesting that the suppression is not dependent on inhibitory mechanisms. Paired-pulse facilitation of field and intracellular EPSPs were enhanced by carbachol, indicating that the suppression is likely due to inhibition of presynaptic glutamate release. These results indicate that, in addition to well known effects on postsynaptic conductances that increase cellular excitability, cholinergic activation in the entorhinal cortex results in a strong reduction in strength of excitatory synaptic inputs from the piriform cortex.

Effects of serotonin on the intrinsic membrane properties of Layer II medial entorhinal cortex neurons	HIPPOCAMPUS			English	Article						5-HT; stellate cells; perforant path; GIRK; I-h	HYPERPOLARIZATION-ACTIVATED CURRENT; HIPPOCAMPAL PYRAMIDAL CELLS; REDUCES SYNAPTIC EXCITATION; RAT FACIAL MOTONEURONS; CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; IN-VITRO; ADULT-RAT; ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS; 5-HT1A RECEPTORS; CORTICAL-NEURONS	Although serotonin (5-HT) is an important neuromodulator in the superficial layers of the medial entorhinal cortex (mEC), there is some disagreement concerning its influences upon the membrane properties of neurons within this region. We performed whole cell recordings of mEC Layer II projection neurons in rat brain slices in order to characterize the intrinsic influences of 5-HT. In current clamp, 5-HT evoked a biphasic response consisting of a moderately short latency and large amplitude hyperpolarization followed by a slowly developing, long lasting, and small amplitude depolarization. Correspondingly, in voltage clamp, 5-HT evoked a robust outward followed by a smaller inward shift of holding current. The outward current evoked by 5-HT showed a consistent current/voltage (I/V) relationship across cells with inward rectification, and demonstrating a reversal potential that was systematically dependent upon the extracellular concentration of K+, suggesting that it was predominantly carried by potassium ions. However, the inward current showed a less consistent IN relationship across different cells, suggesting multiple independent ionic mechanisms. The outward current was mediated through activation of 5-HT1A receptors via a G-protein dependent mechanism while inward currents were evoked in a 5-HT1A-independent fashion. A significant proportion of the inward current was blocked by the I-h inhibitor ZD7288 and appeared to be due to 5-HT modulation of I-h as 5-HT shifted the activation curve of I-h in a depolarizing fashion. Serotonin is thus likely to influence, in a composite fashion, the information processing of Layer II neurons in the mEC and thus, the passage of neocortical information via the perforant pathway to the hippocampus.

Switching between "on" and "off" states of persistent activity in lateral entorhinal layer III neurons	HIPPOCAMPUS			English	Article						hippocampal formation; intrinsic properties; cholinergic modulation; post-stimulus spiking; persistent spiking activity	TO-SAMPLE TASK; PARAHIPPOCAMPAL REGION; WORKING-MEMORY; DELAYED MATCH; CORTEX; RAT; REPRESENTATION; ORGANIZATION; CONNECTIONS; RESPONSES	Persistent neural spiking maintains information during a, working memory task when a stimulus is no longer present. During I retention, this activity needs to be stable to distractors. More importantly, when retention is no longer relevant, cessation of the activity is necessary to enable processing and retention of subsequent information. Here, by means of intracellular recording with sharp microelectrode in in vitro rat brain slices, we demonstrate that single principal layer III neurons of the lateral entorhinal cortex (EC) generate persistent spiking activity with a novel ability to reliably toggle between spiking activity and a silent state. Our data indicates that in the presence of muscarmic receptor activation, persistent activity following an excitatory input may be induced and that a subsequent excitatory input can terminate this activity and cause the neuron to return to a silent state. Moreover, application of inhibitory hyperpolarizing stimuli is neither able to decrease the frequency of the persistent activity nor terminate it. The persistent activity can also be initiated and terminated by synchronized synaptic stimuli of layer II/III of the perirhinal cortex. The neuronal ability to switch "On" and "Off" persistent activity may facilitate the concurrent representation of temporally segregated information arriving in the EC and being directed toward the hippocampus.

Contribution of the anterior thalamic nuclei to conditional learning in rats	HIPPOCAMPUS			English	Article						anterior thalamic nuclei; visuo-spatial conditional learning	SPATIAL MEMORY; LATERODORSAL NUCLEUS; MAMMILLARY REGION; LESIONS; HIPPOCAMPUS; CORTEX; PROJECTIONS; FORNIX; IMPAIRMENTS; CONNECTIONS	The anterior thalamic region is intimately linked anatomically and functionally with the hippocampus, which is critical for various forms of spatial learning. Rats with lesions to the anterior thalamic nuclei and a control group were trained on a visual-spatial conditional associative learning task in which they had to learn to go to one of two locations depending on the particular visual cue presented on each trial; the rats approached the cues from different directions. The animals were subsequently tested on a spatial working memory task, the eight-arm radial maze. Performance on both these tasks had previously been shown to be impaired by hippocampal lesions. Rats with anterior thalamic damage were able to acquire the conditional associative task at a rate comparable to that of the control animals, but were impaired on the radial maze task. The finding of a dissociation between the effects of lesions of the anterior thalamic nuclei on two different classes of behavior known to be associated with hippocampal function suggest that while different neural stations within the extended hippocampal circuit may all play a role in spatial learning, the role of each of these regions in such learning may be more selective than previously considered.

Unreinforced spatial (latent) learning is mediated by a circuit that includes dorsal entorhinal cortex and fimbria fornix	HIPPOCAMPUS			English	Article						radial maze; discrimination; inactivation; muscimol; conditioned-cue-preference; neural systems; parahippocampal	WORKING MEMORY PERFORMANCE; RETROGRADE-AMNESIA; HIPPOCAMPAL FUNCTION; DIAGONAL BAND; NONSPATIAL CHANGES; SELECTIVE LESIONS; PLACE NAVIGATION; RATS; DISCRIMINATION; BEHAVIOR	The relationship of the entorhinal cortex (EC) and fimbria-fornix (FF) in unreinforced spatial (latent) learning was studied using the conditioned-cue-preference task on an eight-arm radial maze. The maze was turned before every trial to eliminate the use of local cues. During three pre-exposure sessions, food-deprived rats explored the center platform and two adjacent arms of the maze. Since most of the same cues were visible from both arm locations, discriminating them required spatial learning. The rats were then alternately confined to the end of each arm over several days: one arm always contained food, the other was empty. Finally, the rats were allowed free access to both arms with no food present. Normal rats spent more time in their food-paired than in their unpaired arms showing that they learned to discriminate between the arm locations. Bilateral micro-injections of muscimol into the dorsal, but not into the ventral EC, given before the pre-exposure sessions only, impaired the discrimination. The discrimination was also impaired in rats with unilateral lesions of FF and contralateral injections of muscimol into the dorsal EC given before the preexposure sessions. Ipsilateral FF lesions and entorhinal inactivation had no effect. These results indicate that the acquisition of information during unreinforced exploration of a novel environment requires an intact circuit involving the dorsal EC and fimbria fornix. Together with previous reports, that this form of learning does not require a functional hippocampus, (Gaskin et al. (2005) Hippocampus 15:1085-1093) the findings also suggest that the acquisition of certain kinds of unreinforced information by this circuit is independent of the hippocampus.

(1998) Neuropsychologia 36:1217-1238). Based on this evidence, we predicted that H.M., whose caudal parahippocampal cortex was structurally intact (Corkin et al. (1997) J Neurosci 17:3964-3979), would be able to learn the spatial memory task. This task was designed to be a human analogue of the Morris water maze in that it measured participants' ability to learn the location of a target, which was an invisible weight sensor placed under a carpet (Bohbot et al. (1998) Neuropsychologia 36:1217-1238). H.M. was first tested with the sensor under a small carpet (162 cm X 150 cm). Then, interspersed with the first sensor location, he was tested with the sensor in a second location, covered by a larger carpet (250 cm X 210 cm). He found the second target location in a direct path on only 10% of the trials. In contrast, when tested on the first sensor location, he walked directly toward the center of the testing area in 19/35 trials and from there found the sensor in a direct path on 15 of the 19 trials (80%). The number of direct hits at the first target location was significantly greater than chance (P < 0.0005). An analysis of H.M.'s paths showed that they were characteristic of fast learning, and that he did not rely on egocentric, short-term, or working memory strategies to learn the task. H.M's ability to locate the sensor is remarkable given his severe amnesia and his inability to explicitly recollect the testing episode. These findings underscore the role of the parahippocampal cortex in spatial memory. (C) 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Medial EC (MEC) Layer II stellate cells (SCs) serve as one of the most prominent target cell types within the EC for inputs arising from higher cortical areas, and these same cells provide most of the output from the EC to the hippocampal region. We used the whole-cell patch clamp technique in a rat in vitro slice preparation to test whether SCs express afterhyperpolarization (AHP) currents and if these currents can be modulated. Our results revealed that SCs contain medium (MIK(Ca)) an slow (sI(AHP)) Ca2+-dependent K+ currents. Furthermore, we determine that an apamin-sensitive current does not underlie the mAHP in SCs. Our studies also showed that a cAMP-dependent modulation process significantly reduces MIK((Ca)), sI(AHP), and spike-frequency adaptation in MEC Layer II SCs. Modulation of the firing pattern of SCs resulting from this effect may play an important role in the encoding of information related to memory processes. (c) 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

In the present study, rats with lesions of the fornix, hippocampus, and normal control animals were trained on two spatial-visual conditional learning tasks in which they had to form arbitrary associations between visual stimuli and the context in which these stimuli were embedded. In one condition, rats were required to choose stimulus X in place A and stimulus Y in place B, and there was no overlap in the contents of the two scenes. In the other condition, the animal approached the same scene from two different directions and had to select stimulus X when the scene was viewed from perspective A and to select stimulus Y when the scene was viewed from perspective B. Rats with fornix transection were able to learn both conditional tasks at a ble to that of normal control animals, but rats with hippocampal damage were severely impaired under both conditions. The findings extend the range of tasks known to be sensitive to damage of the hippocampus. In addition, the results argue that the fornix is not necessary for the acquisition of certain spatial conditional learning tasks and that this brain structure cannot be used as an indicator of hippocampal dysfunction under all learning situations.

Results provided illustrate the excellent properties of our proposed detection scheme (both in identifying fault occurrence and clearance times). The faults considered have occurred in reaction.,.,heels which are commonly used in the ACS as actuators. Simulations for the detection results for multiple faults, simultaneous faults, as well as influences caused by dynamic coupling effects of one axis on others in the ACS have also been provided.

The main problem with this model lies in how to synchronize a large number of tapes in an adaptive way so that the machine is able to accomplish tasks such as object classification. We propose that such mechanisms exist already in the eye. A popular view is that the retina, typically associated with high gain and adaptation for light processing, is actually performing local preprocessing by means of its center-surround receptive field. We would like to show another property of the retina: The ability to integrate many independent processes. We believe that this integration is implemented by synchronization of neuronal oscillations. In this paper, we present a model of the retina consisting of a series of coupled oscillators which can synchronize on several scales. Synchronization is an analog process which is converted into a digital spike train in the output of the retina. We have developed a hardware implementation of this model, which enables us to carry out rapid simulation of multineuron oscillatory dynamics. We show that the properties of the spike trains in our model are similar to those found in vivo in the cat retina.

Comparison of ARTMAP neural networks for classification for face recognition from video	IMAGE ANALYSIS AND RECOGNITION, PROCEEDINGS	Lecture Notes in Computer Science		English	Proceedings Paper	4th International Conference on Image Analysis and Recognition	AUG 22-24, 2007	Montreal, CANADA	Univ Waterloo, Pattern Anal & Mach Intelligence Grp, Univ Porto, Fac Engn, Dept Elect & Comp Engn,, Inst Engenhar Biomed, IEEE Kitchener-Waterloo Sect				In video-based of face recognition applications, the What-and-Where Fusion Neural Network (WWFNN) has been shown to reduce the generalization error by accumulating a classifier's predictions over time, according to each individual in the environment. In this paper, three ARTMAP variants - fuzzy ARTMAP, ART-EMAP (Stage 1) and ARTMAP-IC - are compared for the classification of faces detected in the WWFNN. ART-EMAP (stage 1) and ARTMAP-IC expand on the well-known fuzzy ARTMAP by using distributed activation of category neurons, and by biasing distributed predictions according to the number of time these neurons are activated by training set patterns. The average performance of the WWFNNs with each ARTMAP network is compared to the WWFNN with a reference k-NN classifier in terms of generalization error, convergence time and compression, using a data set of real-world video sequences. Simulations results indicate that when ARTMAP-IC is used inside the WWFNN, it can achieve a generalization error that is significantly higher (about 20% on average) than if fuzzy ARTMAP or ART-EMAP is used. Indeed, ARTMAP-IC is less discriminant than the two other ARTMAP networks in cases with complex decision bounderies, when the training data is limited and unbalanced, as found in complex video data. However, ARTMAP-IC can outperform the others when classes are designed with a larger number of training patterns.

In this work, the focus is handwritten words in the context of Brazilian bank checks, specifically the months of the year, and no restrictions are placed on the types or styles of writing or the number of writers. A global feature set and two architectures of artificial neural networks (ANN) are evaluated for classification of the words. The objectives are to evaluate the performance of conventional and class-modular multiple-layer perceptron (MLP) architectures, to develop a rejection mechanism based on multiple thresholds, and to analyze the behavior of the feature set proposed in the two architectures. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the class-modular architecture over the conventional MLP architecture. A rejection mechanism with multiple thresholds demonstrates favorable performance in both architectures. The feature set analysis shows the importance of the structural primitives such as concavities and convexities, and perceptual primitives such as ascenders and descenders. The experimental results reveal a recognition rate of 81.75% without the rejection mechanism, and a reliability rate 91.52% with a rejection rate of 25.33%. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Research on prenatal maternal stress (PNMS) indicates that exposure to stress in utero results in developmental deficits. We hypothesized that children exposed to high objective PNMS from a natural disaster early in pregnancy would exhibit higher rates of stereotypical play and lower rates of mature functional play than their low-stress counterparts would. We examined the functional play abilities of 52 2-year-olds exposed to low or high objective PNMS from a natural disaster within a nonstructured play session. Toddlers exposed to high objective PNMS, subjective PNNIS, or both exhibited less functional and more stereotypical toy play, with less diversity, compared to toddlers exposed to low FNMS. PNMS appears to affect functional play development in toddlers negatively. These results replicate delays in language and intellectual functioning observed in these toddlers using the Bayley Scales.

In this study, a hyperspectral-imaging-based technique was developed to achieve rapid, accurate and objective assessment of pork quality. The principal component analysis (PCA) and stepwise operation methods were used to select feature waveband from the entire spectral wavelengths (430 to 980 nm). Then the feature waveband images were extracted at the selected feature wavebands from raw hyperspectral images, and the average reflectance (R) was calculated within the whole loin-eye area. Artificial neural network was used to classify these groups. Results showed that PCA analysis had a better performance than that of stepwise operation for feature waveband images selection. The 1st derivative data gave a better result than that of mean reflectance spectra data. The best classified result was 87.5% correction. The error frequency showed that RSE samples were easier to classify. The PFN and PSE samples were difficult to separate from each other.

BAVMs consist of tangled masses of tortuous arteries and veins devoid of intervening capillaries that frequently extend from brain parenchyma into the subarachnoid space. Apart from BAVMs, three major groups of vascular malformations of the brain are known: cavernous hemangioma, venous angioma, and capillary telangiectasia. BAVMs and cavernous hemangioma often cause hemorrhages, while venous angioma and capillary telangiectasia are typically asymptomatic. Presented here is the case of a 14-year-old girl who died from a ruptured BAVM. The present case is a reminder that the forensic pathologist should be able to recognize BAVMs and to differentiate it from other types of vascular malformations. Although rare, it is a cause of sudden death not to be overlooked, especially in children.

Method: Eighty-two OTs were asked to identify the likely source population (HA/FLL) associated with 26 ADL errors. Results: Only 50% of errors were related to the correct source population by more than 70% of OTs. Conclusion: Performance-based ADL assessments allowing for the documentation of context could enhance OTs' interpretation of ADL errors.

(Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) was examined electrophysiologically for its responses to stimulation by various pyranose and furanose sugars. The results were compared to those from previous work on the sugar-sensitive neuron of the LST sensillum on the galea. We show that the L1 contact-chemoreceptor sensillum contains one sugar-sensitive neuron with furanose but no pyranose sites. It has response characteristics that differ from those of the sugar-sensitive neuron in the LST. Behavioural 2-choice feeding experiments show that, even with both known sugar-sensitive neurons disabled, larvae can still discriminate between disks treated with either distilled water or alpha-D-glucose. We conclude that the epipharyngeal sensilla must thus also contain a sugar-sensitive neuron. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Our findings are discussed in relation to changes that occur during the development of both the host plant and the insect. To our knowledge, this is the first paper to examine the responses from contact-chemoreceptor sensilla of very young second-instar caterpillar larvae. (c) 2006 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

We previously showed that the expression of pyroglutamyl peptidase II (PPII), the TRH degrading ectoenzyme, is regulated in rat brain by amygdaline kindling, a paradigm that activates neuronal pathways in the limbic system increasing the expression of several neuropeptides including TRH and opioids. To understand the specificity of this phenomenon, we studied APN and NEP expression in brains of partially or fully kindled rats (stage II and V), sacrificed 6 h after last stimulus, compared with shamoperated animals. In situ hybridization analysis of NEP mRNA levels showed decreased expression at stage II in CA1, CA2, olfactory tubercle and medial mammillary nucleus, and increased at stage V in CA1 and CA2 cells. These changes were specific for the ipsilateral side. APN mRNA levels, semi-quantified by RT-PCR, were decreased at stage II and increased at stage V, in frontal cortex-olfactory tubercle, and hippocampus. NEP and APN enzymatic activities, determined by fluorometric assays, followed similar variations to their respective mRNA levels. The coordinated changes (in some regions) of NEP and APN expression were opposite to those previously observed for PPII mRNA and activity levels in limbic regions. These results demonstrate that expression of ectopeptidases can be regulated when peptide neurons are activated and, that regulation is enzyme-, region-, and stage-specific.

PKC modulation of transmitter release by SNAP-25 at sensory-to-motor synapses in Aplysia	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article							PROTEIN-KINASE-C; SYNAPTOSOME-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN; SENSORIMOTOR SYNAPSES; DEPENDENT PHOSPHORYLATION; SYNAPTIC-TRANSMISSION; CHROMAFFIN CELLS; SYNAPTOTAGMIN-I; MEMBRANE-FUSION; VESICLE POOL; EXOCYTOSIS	Activation of phosphokinase C (PKC) can increase transmitter release at sensory-motor neuron synapses in Aplysia, but the target of PKC phosphorylation has not been determined. One putative target of PKC at synapses is the synaptosomal-associated protein of 25 kDa (SNAP-25), a member of the SNARE protein complex implicated in synaptic vesicle docking and fusion. To determine whether PKC regulated transmitter release through phosphorylation of SNAP-25, we cloned Aplysia SNAP-25 and expressed enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-coupled SNAP-25 constructs mutated at the PKC phosphorylation site Ser198 in Aplysia sensory neurons. We found several distinct effects of expression of EGFP-SNAP-25 constructs. First, the rates of synaptic depression were slowed when cells contained SNAP-25 with phosphomimetic residues Glu or Asp. Second, PDBu-mediated increases in transmitter release at naive synapses were blocked in cells expressing nonphosphorylated-state SNAP-25. Finally, expression of EGFP-coupled SNAP-25 but not uncoupled SNAP-25 inhibited 5-HT mediated reversal of depression and the ability of EGFP-coupled SNAP-25 to inhibit the reversal of depression was affected by changes at Ser198. These results suggest SNAP-25 and phosphorylation of SNAP-25 by PKC can regulate transmitter release at Aplysia sensory motor neuron synapses by a number of distinct processes.

Neural averaging in motor learning	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article							PROTEIN-SYNTHESIS; MEMORY; CONSOLIDATION; RECONSOLIDATION; ENVIRONMENT; ADAPTATION; SLEEP	The capacity for skill development over multiple training episodes is fundamental to human motor function. We have studied the process by which skills evolve with training by progressively modifying a series of motor learning tasks that subjects performed over a 1-mo period. In a series of empirical and modeling studies, we show that performance undergoes repeated modification with new learning. Each in a series of prior training episodes contributes such that present performance reflects a weighted average of previous learning. Moreover, we have observed that the relative weighting of skills learned wholly in the past changes with time. This suggests that the neural substrate of skill undergoes modification after consolidation.

The neuronal cell yield obtained from the NT-2 cells is partially dependent on the time of differentiation (24-55 days). SK-N-SH cells differentiate into a mixed population of neuronal and epithelium-like cells. Here we report modified protocols that increase the number of differentiated NT-2 and SK-N-SH cells and that establish an enriched neuronal SK-N-SH-derived cell population essentially devoid of nonneuronal cells. Differentiated cells express the cytoskeleton-associated protein tau and other typical neuronal markers, such as Map2, Ngn1, NeuroD, Mash1, and GluR which are also expressed in primary human fetal neurons. Telomerase activity is down-regulated in differentiated cells, which is consistent with the telomerase status of primary fetal human neurons. Thus, differentiated NT2 and SK-N-SH cells may represent an excellent source for studies investigating the role of telomerase or other survival-promoting activities in protecting human neuronal cells from cell death-mediating stresses associated with neurodegenerative diseases.

Previously, we found early intracellular signalling changes in the limbic system after acute MI in rats. The aim of the present study was to test the presence of behavioural deficits compatible with animal models of depression after acute MI in rats and to verify whether this is associated with apoptosis vulnerability markers. Methods: Occlusion of the left-anterior descending artery was induced for 40 minutes under anesthesia in adult male Sprague-Dawley rats. Control sham rats underwent the same surgical procedure without occlusion. After surgery, subgroups of MI and sham rats were treated with desipramine, 10 mg/kg, intraperitoneally for 14 days. All rats were tested on measures of behavioural depression 14 days after surgery with a sucrose preference test, a forced swimming test, and a memory test (Morris water maze [MWM]). The rats were sacrificed, and the MI size was determined; apoptosis was estimated in the prefrontal cortex, hypothalamus, amygdala and hippocampus by measuring Bax:Bcl-2 ratio and caspase-3 activity. Results: Untreated MI rats drank significantly less sucrose and swam significantly less than sham rats. No difference was found on the MWM. Behavioural depression was prevented by desipramine. Bax:Bcl-2 ratio was significantly increased in the prefrontal cortex and hypothalamus of MI rats, compared with sham rats; caspase-3 activity showed no difference between the 2 groups. Bax:Bcl-2 ratio in the prefrontal cortex was correlated with swim time in the forced swim test. Conclusion: Behavioural impairment and limbic apoptotic events observed after a myocardial infarct are consistent with a model of human post-MI depression.

We have previously demonstrated that OPC produces an increase in 5-HT neurotransmission and a decreased response of 5-HT neurons to the acute administration of paroxetine in the DRN, an effect that appears to be mediated by OPC's 5-HT1A receptor affinity. The current study sets out to investigate more specifically the effects of OPC on 5-HT1A pre- and post-synaptic receptors, to assess whether it acts as an agonist or antagonist. Using an electrophysiological model of in vivo extraceltular recordings in anaesthetized rats, the effects of OPC was assessed on pre-synaptic DRN 5-HT1A autoreceptors and post-synaptically on hippocampal 5-HT1A receptors of CA, pyramidal neurons. OPC applied by microiontophoresis, produced a significant decrease in the firing activity of 5-HT neurons of the DRN and of quisquatate-activated CA(3) pyramidal neurons of the dorsal hippocampus. The effects of OPC on 5-HT1A receptors were significantly reduced by the co-application of the 5-HT1A antagonist WAY-100635. In addition, the effects of OPC were not blocked by the injection of the sigma antagonists NE-100 or hatoperidol. Therefore, OPC is acting as an agonist on both pre- and post-synaptic 5-HT1A receptors. The current findings combined with previous data on OPC suggest a pharmacological profile that warrants further investigation.

Current physiological measures of sexual arousal are intrusive, hard to compare between genders, and quantitatively problematic. Aim. To investigate thermal imaging technology as a means of solving these problems. Methods. Twenty-eight healthy men and 30 healthy women viewed a neutral film clip, after which they were randomly assigned to view one of three other video conditions: (i) neutral (N = 19); (ii) humor (N = 19); and (iii) sexually explicit (N = 20). Main Outcome Measures. Genital and thigh temperatures were continuously recorded using a TSA ImagIR camera. Subjective measures of sexual arousal, humor, and relaxation were assessed using Likert-style questions prior to showing the baseline video and following each film. Results. Statistical (Tukey HSD) post-hoc comparisons (P < 0.05) demonstrated that both men and women viewing the sexually arousing video had significantly greater genital temperature (mean = 33.89 degrees C, SD = 1.00) than those in the humor (mean = 32.09 degrees C, SD = 0.93) or neutral (mean = 32.13 degrees C, SD = 1.24) conditions. Men and women in the erotic condition did not differ from each other in time to peak genital temperature (men mean = 664.6 seconds, SD = 164.99; women mean = 743 seconds, SD = 137.87). Furthermore, genital temperature was significantly and highly correlated with subjective ratings of sexual arousal (range r = 0.51-0.68, P < 0.001). There were no significant differences in thigh temperature between groups. Conclusion. Thermal imaging is a promising technology for the assessment of physiological sexual arousal in both men and women.

It is unknown the extent to which these cognitive and personality vulnerability factors overlap or are distinct. Two independent factor analytic studies addressed the degree of construct independence using measures from the three cognitive theories along with trait neuroticism, self-esteem, and depressive symptoms. Principal factor analysis from Study 1 (n = 950) revealed four discriminable factors. Three of the factors corresponded to each theory's vulnerability: negative cognitive style, dysfunctional attitudes, and rumination. A fourth factor consisted of depressive symptoms, self-esteem, neuroticism. Confirmatory factor analysis from Study 2 (n = 431) showed that the best fit for the data was a four factor model that replicated the exploratory factor analyses.

Parameter estimation for differential equations: a generalized smoothing approach	JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY			English	Article						differential equation; dynamic system; estimating equation; functional data analysis; gauss-newton method; parameter cascade; profiled estimation	OPTIMIZATION; SYSTEMS; MODELS	We propose a new method for estimating parameters in models that are defined by a system of non-linear differential equations. Such equations represent changes in system outputs by linking the behaviour of derivatives of a process to the behaviour of the process itself. Current methods for estimating parameters in differential equations from noisy data are computationally intensive and often poorly suited to the realization of statistical objectives such as inference and interval estimation. The paper describes a new method that uses noisy measurements on a subset of variables to estimate the parameters defining a system of non-linear differential equations. The approach is based on a modification of data smoothing methods along with a generalization of profiled estimation. We derive estimates and confidence intervals, and show that these have low bias and good coverage properties respectively for data that are simulated from models in chemical engineering and neurobiology. The performance of the method is demonstrated by using real world data from chemistry and from the progress of the autoimmune disease lupus.

Parental occupational exposure to pesticides is also a concern because exposures occurring during pregnancy and carry-home residues also contribute to children's cumulative burden. A number of epidemiological studies consistently reported increased risks between pesticide exposures and childhood leukemia, brain cancer, neuroblastoma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, Wilms' tumor, and Ewing's sarcoma. An extensive review of these studies was published in 1998 (Zahm & Ward, 1998). Fifteen case-control studies, 4 cohort studies, and 2 ecological studies have been published since this review, and 15 of these 21 studies reported statistically significant increased risks between either childhood pesticide exposure or parental occupational exposure and childhood cancer. Therefore, one can confidently state that there is at least some association between pesticide exposure and childhood cancer. However, an unambiguous mechanistic cause-and-effect relationship between pesticide exposure and childhood cancer was not demonstrated in these studies, and modifying factors such as genetic predisposition, rarely considered in the reviewed studies, likely play an important role. While the time window of exposure may be a crucial determinant for biological effects associated with pesticide exposure on children, studies have not contributed definitive information on the most vulnerable period. Accurate exposure assessment remains a challenge; future epidemiological studies need to assess gene environment interactions and use improved exposure measures, including separate parental interviews, specific pesticide exposure questions, and semiquantitative exposure measures that can be used to confirm information obtained through questionnaires.

Given that the metabolites of alcohol are likely carcinogens and that leukemia, the most frequent childhood cancer, can arise in utero, the study of alcohol consumption as a potential risk factor for the development of childhood cancer is justified. This article summarizes the epidemiological evidence on the association between parental exposure to alcohol and the risk of childhood cancers. To do this, a thorough search of the literature from 1960 to 2003 using the PubMed database was carried out. It yielded 33 case-control studies published between 1982 and 2003, including 13 studies that considered paternal exposure in the preconceptional period. In 10 of the 33 studies at least 1 statistically significant risk increase was reported in relation with parental alcohol consumption; in 7 of these studies the increase was related to maternal consumption, whereas in 3 studies, it was related to paternal consumption. The cancers most often found associated with parental drinking were leukemia, brain tumors, and neuroblastoma. A few studies also reported a protective effect with maternal exposure at modest levels. Inconsistencies in the results and the low risks reported do not suggest an association between childhood cancer and parental consumption of alcohol. However, before reaching any definitive conclusions, methodological issues need to be addressed in future studies, as well as the role of genetic susceptibility. Moreover, subtypes of specific cancers need to be studied separately.

Recent advances in research on radiofrequency fields and health: 2001-2003	JOURNAL OF TOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH-PART B-CRITICAL REVIEWS			English	Review							FREQUENCY ELECTROMAGNETIC-FIELDS; CELLULAR TELEPHONE USERS; ADRENAL CHROMAFFIN CELLS; MOBILE PHONE RADIATION; 835.62 MHZ FDMA; JUNCTION INTERCELLULAR COMMUNICATION; SUTTON COLDFIELD TRANSMITTER; INCREASE LYMPHOMA INCIDENCE; E-MU-PIM1 TRANSGENIC MICE; HIGH-POWER TRANSMITTERS	The widespread use of wireless telecommunications devices, particularly mobile phones, has resulted in increased human exposure to radiofrequency (RF) fields. Although national and international agencies have established safety guidelines for exposure to RF fields, concerns remain about the potential for adverse health outcomes to occur in relation to RF field exposure. The extensive literature on RF fields and health has been reviewed by a number of authorities, including the Royal Society of Canada (1999), the European Commission's Scientific Committee on Toxicity, Ecotoxicity, and the Environment (CSTEE, 2001), the British Medical Association (2001), the Swedish Radiation Protection Authority (Boice & McLaughlin, 2002), and the Health Council of the Netherlands (2002). This report provides an update on recent research results on the potential health risks of RF fields since the publication of the Royal Society of Canada report in 1999 (See Krewski et al., 2001a) and our previous 2001 update (Krewski et al., 2001b), covering the period 2001-2003. The present report examines new data on dosimetry and exposure assessment, biological effects such as enzyme induction, and toxicological effects, including genotoxicity, carcinogenicity, and testicular and reproductive outcomes. Epidemiological studies of mobile phone users and occupationally exposed populations are examined, along with human and animal studies of neurological and behavioral effects. All of the authoritative reviews completed within the last 2 yr have concluded that there is no clear evidence of adverse health effects associated with RF fields. However, following a recent review of nine epidemiological studies of mobile phones and cancer, Kundi et al. (2004) concluded that the possibility of an enhanced cancer risk cannot be excluded. These same reviews support the need for further research to clarify the possible associations between RF fields and adverse health outcomes that have appeared in some reports. The results of the ongoing World Health Organization (WHO) study of mobile phones will provide important new information in this regard.

JOURNAL OF VISION			English	Article						contour integration; fovea; periphery; crowding; snakes; ladders	PATTERN-DISCRIMINATION; TEXTURE SEGREGATION; NONLINEAR PROCESSES; ASSOCIATION FIELD; INTEGRATION; VISION; CHANNELS; CONTRAST; ORIENTATION; NEURONS	We studied the perceptual integration of contours consisting of Gabor elements positioned along a smooth path, embedded among distractor elements. Contour elements either formed tangents to the path ("snakes") or were perpendicular to it ("ladders"). Perfectly straight snakes and ladders were easily detected in the fovea but, at an eccentricity of 6 degrees, only the snakes were detectable. The disproportionate impairment of peripheral ladder detection remained when we brought foveal performance away from ceiling by jittering the orientations of the elements. We propose that the failure to detect peripheral ladders is a form of crowding, the phenomenon observed when identification of peripherally located letters is disrupted by flanking letters. D. G. Pelli, M. Palomares, and N. J. Majaj ( 2004) outlined a model in which simple feature detectors are followed by integration fields, which are involved in tasks, such as letter identification, that require the outputs of several detectors. They proposed that crowding occurs because small integration fields are absent from the periphery, leading to inappropriate feature integration by large peripheral integration fields. We argue that the "association field," which has been proposed to mediate contour integration ( D. J. Field, A. Hayes, & R. F. Hess, 1993), is a type of integration field. Our data are explained by an elaboration of Pelli et al.'s model, in which weak ladder integration competes with strong snake integration. In the fovea, the association fields were small, and the model integrated snakes and ladders with little interference. In the periphery, the association fields were large, and integration of ladders was severely disrupted by interference from spurious snake contours. In contrast, the model easily detected snake contours in the periphery. In a further demonstration of the possible link between contour integration and crowding, we ran our contour integration model on groups of three-letter stimuli made from short line segments. Our model showed several key properties of crowding: The critical spacing for crowding to occur was independent of the size of the target letter, scaled with eccentricity, and was greater on the peripheral side of the target.

Peripheral vision: Good for biological motion, bad for signal noise segregation?	JOURNAL OF VISION			English	Article						biological motion; peripheral vision; noise segregation	POINT-LIGHT DISPLAYS; PSYCHOMETRIC FUNCTION; PERCEPTION; GENDER; IDENTIFICATION; PSYCHOPHYSICS; RECOGNITION; ADAPTATION; EMOTION; CUES	Biological motion perception, having both evolutionary and social importance, is performed by the human visual system with a high degree of sensitivity. It is unclear whether peripheral vision has access to the specialized neural systems underlying biological motion perception; however, given the motion component, one would expect peripheral vision to be, if not specialized, at least highly accurate in perceiving biological motion. Here we show that the periphery can indeed perceive biological motion. However, the periphery suffers from an inability to detect biological motion signals when they are embedded in dynamic visual noise. We suggest that this peripheral deficit is not due to biological motion perception per se, but to signal/noise segregation.

The present review proposes a new account of the evolution of hemispheric specialisation, a primitive system of ``management of the body's energy resources''. This model is distinct from traditionally evoked cognitive science categories such as verbal/ spatial, analytic/ holistic, etc., or the current dominant neuroethological model proposing that the key is approach/ avoidance behaviour. Specifically, I show that autonomic, immune, psychomotor, motivational, perceptual, and memory systems are similarly and coherently specialised in the brain hemispheres in rodents and man. This energy resource management model, extended to human neuropsychology, is termed here the ``psychic tonus'' model of hemispheric specialisation.

The present article reviews evidence regarding the role of the orbitofrontal cortex in the processing of novel information, breaches of expectation, and memory. Functional neuroimaging evidence is provided that there is a difference between the anterior and posterior orbitofrontal cortex in such processing. Exposure to novel information gives rise to a selective increase of activity in the granular anterior part of the orbitofrontal cortex (area 11) and this activity increases when subjects attempt to encode this information in memory. If the stimuli violate expectations (e.g., inspection of graffiti-like stimuli in the context of other regular stimuli) or are unpleasant (i.e., exposure to the sounds of car crashes), there is increased response in the posteromedial agranular/dysgranular area 13 of the orbitofrontal region. The anatomic data provide a framework within which to understand these functional neuroimaging findings.

Patients with OFC injury can demonstrate relatively isolated difficulties with decision making, and the development of laboratory tasks that captured these difficulties was an important advance. However, much of the work to date has been limited by the use of a single, complex decision-making task and by a narrow focus on risky decisions. A fuller understanding of the neural basis of decision making requires identification of the simpler components that underlie this complex behavior. Here, I review evidence that OFC lesions disrupt reversal learning in humans, as in animals, and show that this deficit in reversal learning is an important mechanism underlying the difficulties of such patients in the Iowa gambling task. Reversal learning, in turn, can be decomposed into simpler processes: a failure to rapidly learn from negative feedback may be the critical difficulty for OFC patients. OFC damage can also affect forms of decision making that do not require trial-by-trial learning. Preference judgment is a simple form of decision making that requires comparing the relative value of options. Humans with OFC lesions are more inconsistent in their choices, even in very simple preference judgment tasks. These results are broadly consistent with the view that OFC is critically involved in representing the relative value of stimuli, but also raise the possibility that this region plays distinct roles in reinforcement learning and value-based judgment.

These components should be removed from the data to achieve structured noise reduction and improve any subsequent detection and analysis of signal fluctuations related to neural activity. We propose a new automatic method called CORSICA (CORrection of Structured noise using spatial Independent Component Analysis) to identify the components related to physiological noise, using prior information on the spatial localization of the main physiological fluctuations in fMRI data. As opposed to existing spectral priors, which may be subject to aliasing effects for long-TR data sets (typically acquired with TR > 1 s), such spatial priors can be applied to fMRI data, regardless of the TR of the acquisitions. By comparing the proposed automatic selection to a manual selection performed visually by a human operator, we first show that CORSICA is able to identify the noise-related components for long-TR data with a high sensitivity and a specificity of 1. On short-TR data sets, we validate that the proposed method of noise reduction allows a substantial improvement of the signal-to-noise ratio evaluated at the cardiac and respiratory frequencies, even in the gray matter, while preserving the main fluctuations related to neural activity.

J	Mendrek, A				Mendrek, Adrianna			Reversal of normal cerebral sexual dimorphism in schizophrenia: Evidence and speculations	MEDICAL HYPOTHESES			English	Article							PERIGENUAL CINGULATE GYRUS; GENDER-DIFFERENCES; NEGATIVE SYMPTOMS; HUMAN-BRAIN; NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL PERFORMANCE; COGNITIVE FUNCTION; MENSTRUAL-CYCLE; DIGIT RATIO; HORMONES; TESTOSTERONE	Sex differences in epidemiology, clinical course and symptomatology of schizophrenia have been widely documented, but still relatively little is known about the brain sexual dimorphism in this psychiatric disorder. While some neuroanatomical and neuropsychological studies have reported existence of differences between mate and female patients in a direction of normal sexual dimorphism, others did not find any effect. A few recent reports point to a peculiar disturbance of normal sexual dimorphism in brain regions implicated in the processing of emotions, including amygdala, orbitofrontal cortex and anterior cingulate. Prompted by these findings we compared cerebral activations between the sexes during performance of two emotion processing tasks and found overall much more extensive and intense cerebral activations in men than in women with schizophrenia. Moreover, the pattern of obtained sex differences in cerebral. activation in patients differed significantly from what has been observed in the general population. Based on these preliminary structural and functional neuroimaging data, as well as some clinical reports, it is hypothesized in the present paper that schizophrenia is characterized by a reversed (or at least seriously disturbed) cerebral sexual dimorphism. It is further argued that this phenomenon stems from masculinization and/or un-feminization of females and feminizations and/or un-masculinization of mates by sex steroid hormones, such as estrogen and testosterone, during both organizational and activational stages of neurodevelopment.

Manipulation of protein kinases reveals different mechanisms for upregulation of heat shock proteins in motor neurons and non-neuronal cells	MOLECULAR AND CELLULAR NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							AMYOTROPHIC-LATERAL-SCLEROSIS; CU/ZN-SUPEROXIDE-DISMUTASE; TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR HSF1; GLYCOGEN-SYNTHASE KINASE-3-BETA; INDUCED STRESS-RESPONSE; DNA-BINDING; FACTOR-I; MOLECULAR CHAPERONES; HIPPOCAMPAL-NEURONS; HYPERTHERMIC STRESS	Motor neurons have a high threshold for induction of heat shock proteins (Hsps) in response to stress, a property associated with impaired ability to activate heat shock transcription factor 1 (Hsf1). Hyperphosphorylation of Hsf1 has been established as a requirement for transactivation of heat shock genes. This study demonstrated that the impaired heat shock response in motor neurons is not due to altered phosphorylation of Hsf1 by kinases previously shown to affect activation of Hsf1 in other cells (PKC, GSK3 beta, ERK1, CaMKII alpha). However, a constitutively active form of CaMKIV induced robust expression of Hsp70, as well as transcription of a GFP reporter gene driven by the human inducible Hsp70 promoter in unstressed motor neurons, but not in mouse embryonic fibroblasts. The results point to novel mechanisms of activation of heat shock genes in motor neurons that have relevance to exploitation of endogenous stress responses therapeutically. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Mutations in SYNE1 lead to a newly discovered form of autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxia	NATURE GENETICS			English	Article							NEUROMUSCULAR-JUNCTION; PROTEIN; GENE; NUCLEI; MSP-300; REPEAT; MUTANT	The past decade has seen great advances in unraveling the biological basis of hereditary ataxias. Molecular studies of spinocerebellar ataxias (SCA) have extended our understanding of dominant ataxias(1). Causative genes have been identified for a few autosomal recessive ataxias: Friedreich's ataxia(2), ataxia with vitamin E deficiency(3), ataxia telangiectasia(4), recessive spastic ataxia of Charlevoix-Saguenay(5) and ataxia with oculomotor apraxia type 1 (refs. 6,7) and type 2 (ref. 8). Nonetheless, genes remain unidentified for most recessive ataxias. Additionally, pure cerebellar ataxias, which represent up to 20% of all ataxias, remain poorly studied with only two causative dominant genes being described: CACNA1A (ref. 9) and SPTBN2 (ref. 10). Here, we report a newly discovered form of recessive ataxia in a French-Canadian cohort and show that SYNE1 mutations are causative in all of our kindreds, making SYNE1 the first identified gene responsible for a recessively inherited pure cerebellar ataxia.

However, this effect is short-lived. Here we tested the impact of multiple injections of C3-like Rho antagonists on RGC viability and axon regeneration after optic nerve lesion. Our data show that both neuronal survival and axon regeneration were enhanced with repeated delivery of cell-permeable C3. We found an similar to 1.5-fold increase in RCG survival when additional Rho antagonist injections were performed after the first week from the time of lesion. In contrast, increased regeneration required early inactivation of Rho and injections performed in the second week did not further enhance regenerative outcome. These results reveal differences in the length of the therapeutic windows through which Rho inactivation acts on RGC survival or regeneration after axotomy. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

The present study was undertaken to study the effects of exposure to pathophysiologically relevant concentrations of ammonium chloride on cultured brain capillary endothelial cells in order to identify mechanisms by which ammonia may alter blood-brain barrier function. Conditionally immortalized mouse brain capillary endothelial cells (TM-BBB) were used as an in vitro model of the blood-brain barrier. Gene expression of a series of blood-brain barrier transporters and tight junction proteins was assessed by quantitative real time PCR analysis. Exposure to ammonia (5 mM for 72 h) resulted in significant increases in mRNA levels of taurine transporter (TAUT; 2.0-fold increase) as well as creatine transporter (CRT; 1.9-fold increase) whereas claudin-12 mRNA expression was significantly reduced to 67.7% of control levels. Furthermore, [H-3]taurine and [C-14]creatine uptake were concomitantly increased following exposure to ammonia, suggesting that up-regulation of both TAUT and CRT under hyperammonemic conditions results in an increased function of these two transporters in TM-BBB cells. TAUT and CRT are respectively involved in osmoregulation and energy buffering in the brain, two systems that are thought to be affected in acute liver failure. Furthermore, claudin-12 down-regulation suggests that hyperammonemia may also affect tight junction integrity. Our results provide evidence that ammonia can alter brain capillary endothelial cell gene expression and transporter function. These findings may be relevant to pathological situations involving hyperammonemia, such as liver disease. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Structural variation may therefore reflect variation in behavioural performance. Here, we use diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging to show that variation in white matter integrity in a specific region in the body of the corpus callosum is associated with variation in performance of a bimanual coordination task. When the callosal region showing this association is used as a seed for probabilistic tractography, inter-hemispheric pathways are generated to the supplementary motor area and caudal cingulate motor area. This provides further evidence for the role of medial wall motor areas in bimanual co-ordination and supports the idea that variation in brain structure reflects inter-individual differences in skilled performance.

Here we review studies of the longitudinal glia (LG) in the Drosophila CNS. The LG envelop the neuropil in a membrane sheath, and have features resembling both oligodendrocytes and astrocytes. Because of their unique lineage, morphology and molecular features, the LG provide an excellent model to study the genetic mechanisms underlying glial subtype differentiation and diversity, glial morphogenesis and neuron-glial interactions during development. In addition, they are proving useful in understanding how glial cells maintain ion and neurotransmitter homeostasis and protect neurons from environmental insult.

J	Gosselin, N; Peretz, I; Johnsen, E; Adolphs, R				Gosselin, Nathalie; Peretz, Isabelle; Johnsen, Erica; Adolphs, Ralph			Amygdala damage impairs emotion recognition from music	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						emotion; music; amygdala; fear; arousal; valence	NEURAL RESPONSES; FACIAL EXPRESSIONS; BRAIN ACTIVITY; REWARD; FEAR; ANTICIPATION; ACTIVATION; TEMPO; DISSOCIATION; INTENSITY	The role of the amygdala in recognition of danger is well established for visual stimuli such as faces. A similar role in another class of emotionally potent stimuli - music - has been recently suggested by the study of epileptic patients with unilateral resection of the anteromedian part of the temporal lobe [Gosselin, N., Peretz, I., Noulhiane, M., Hasboun, D., Beckett, C., & Baulac, M., et al. (2005). Impaired recognition of scary music following unilateral temporal lobe excision. Brain, 128(Pt 3), 628-6401. The goal of the present study was to assess the specific role of the amygdala in the recognition of fear from music. To this aim, we investigated a rare subject, S.M., who has complete bilateral damage relatively restricted to the amygdala and not encompassing other sectors of the temporal lobe. In Experiment 1, S.M. and four matched controls were asked to rate the intensity of fear, peacefulness, happiness, and sadness from computer-generated instrumental music purposely created to express those emotions. Subjects also rated the arousal and valence of each musical stimulus. An error detection task assessed basic auditory perceptual function. S.M. performed normally in this perceptual task, but was selectively impaired in the recognition of scary and sad music. In contrast, her recognition of happy music was normal. Furthermore, S.M. judged the scary music to be less arousing and the peaceful music less relaxing than did the controls. Overall, the pattern of impairment in S.M. is similar to that previously reported in patients with unilateral anteromedial temporal lobe damage. S.M.'s impaired emotional judgments occur in the face of otherwise intact processing of musical features that are emotionally determinant. The use of tempo and mode cues in distinguishing happy from sad music was also spared in S.M. Thus, the amygdala appears to be necessary for emotional processing of music rather than the perceptual processing itself. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

As FXS is well characterised at the cellular level, the condition provides a unique opportunity to investigate how a genetic dysfunction can impact on the development of neurocomputational properties relevant to attention. Thirteen young boys with FXS and 13 mental-age-matched typically developing controls performed a touch-screen-based search task that manipulated the similarity between targets and distractors and their heterogeneity in size. Search speed, path and errors were recorded as multiple measures of performance. Children did not differ in overall search speed or path when searching amongst distractors, but striking error patterns distinguished children with FXS from controls. Firstly, although clear markers of previously found targets remained on screen, children with FXS perseverated on touching previous hits more than typically developing controls, consistent with the well-documented inhibitory deficits in adults with the disorder. Secondly, they could accurately discriminate single target-distractor pairs, but, when searching a complex display, they touched distractors more often than control children when distractors were similar to targets and especially so when these were infrequent, highlighting difficulties in judging relative size and allocate attentional weight independently of stimulus frequency. Thirdly, their performance was also characterised by inaccuracies in pointing, suggesting additional motor control deficits. Taken together, the findings suggest that fragile X syndrome affects the early development of multiple processes contributing to efficient attentional selection, as would be predicted from an understanding of the neurocomputational changes associated with the disorder.

To this end, 20 people with MCI and 20 matched control participants were compared on the episodic FOK task. Results showed that the MCI group made less accurate FOK predictions than the control group by overestimating their memory performance on a recognition task. The MCI overestimation behavior was found to be critically related to the severity of their cognitive decline. In the light of recent neuroanatomical models showing the involvement of a temporal-frontal network underlying accurate FOK predictions, the role of memory and executive processes was evaluated. Thus, participants were also administered memory and executive neuropsychological tests. Correlation analysis revealed a between-group differential pattern indicating that FOK accuracy was primarily related to memory abilities in people with MCI, whereas it was specifically related to executive functioning in control participants. The lesser ability of people with MCI to assess their memory status accurately on an episodic FOK task is discussed in relation to both their subjective memory complaints and to their actual memory deficits which might be mediated by the brain vulnerability of their hippocampus and medial temporal system. It is suggested that their memory weakness may lead people with MCI to use other less reliable forms of memory monitoring. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

An argument for this approach is the finding that right-handers with left hemisphere language dominance prefer the right hand for communicative gestures. However, several studies have reported distinct patterns of hand preferences for different gesture types, such as deictics, batons, or physiographs, and this calls for an alternative hypothesis. We investigated hand preference and gesture types in spontaneous gesticulation during three semi-standardized interviews of three right-handed patients and one left-handed patient with complete callosal disconnection, all with left hemisphere dominance for praxis. Three of them, with left hemisphere language dominance, exhibited a reliable left-hand preference for spontaneous communicative gestures despite their left hand agraphia and apraxia. The fourth patient, with presumed bihemispheric language representation, revealed a consistent right-hand preference for gestures. All four patients displayed batons, tosses, and shrugs more often with the left hand/shoulder, but exhibited a right hand preference for pantomime gestures. We conclude that the hand preference for certain gesture types cannot be predicted by hemispheric dominance for language or by handedness. We found distinct hand preferences for specific gesture types. This suggests a conceptual specificity of the left and right hand gestures. We propose that left hand gestures are related to specialized right hemisphere functions, such as prosody or emotion, and that they are generated independently of left hemisphere language production. Our findings challenge the traditional neuropsychological and psycholinguistic view on communicative gesture production. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Contributions of functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) to sport concussion evaluation	NEUROREHABILITATION			English	Article						concussion; functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI); post-concussive symptoms depression	TRAUMATIC BRAIN-INJURY; PROFESSIONAL SOCCER PLAYERS; COLLEGE FOOTBALL PLAYERS; WORKING-MEMORY; HEAD-INJURY; FRONTAL-CORTEX; ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL EVIDENCE; MAJOR DEPRESSION; PERFORMANCE; GUIDELINES	Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) in contact sport is a problem of such magnitude that improved approaches to diagnosis, investigation and management are urgent. Concussion has traditionally been described as a transient, fully reversible, cerebral dysfunction. However, this seemingly 'mild' injury sometimes results in long-lasting and disabling post-concussion symptoms (PCS) and abnormal neuropsychological profiles characteristic of frontal and/or temporal lobe dysfunction. At present, the pathological changes following concussion remain unclear, but it is now widely accepted that concussion results mainly in functional disturbance rather than structural damage. Therefore, functional imaging techniques can help in demonstrating brain abnormalities undetectable by structural imaging methods. This paper will review the use of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in studies of concussion. Our existing and ongoing fMRI studies will be described as examples to highlight the potential and contribution of this non-invasive functional neuroimaging technique in the assessment of sports-related concussion and its management.

Spinal Cord Injury Locomotor Trial	The evolution of walking-related outcomes over the first 12 weeks of rehabilitation for incomplete traumatic spinal cord injury: The multicenter randomized Spinal Cord Injury Locomotor Trial	NEUROREHABILITATION AND NEURAL REPAIR			English	Article						spinal cord injury; rehabilitation; walking outcomes; treadmill training; locomotion	WEIGHT-SUPPORTED TREADMILL; CLINICAL-TRIALS; NEUROLOGIC RECOVERY; DISTANCE WALKING; MOTOR; THERAPY; TETRAPLEGIA; PATTERNS; GAIT	Background. The Spinal Cord Injury Locomotor Trial (SCILT) compared 12 weeks of step training with body weight support on a treadmill (BWSTT) that included overground practice to a defined but more conventional overground mobility intervention (CONT) in patients with incomplete traumatic SCI within 8 weeks of onset. No previous studies have reported walking-related outcomes during rehabilitation. Methods. This single-blinded, randomized trial entered 107 American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) C and D patients and 38 ASIA B patients with lesions between C5 and L3 who were unable to walk on admission for rehabilitation. The Functional Independence Measure (FIM-L) for walking, 15-m walking speed, and lower extremity motor score (LEMS) were collected every 2 weeks. Results. No significant differences were found at entry and during the treatment phase (12-week mean FIM-L = 5, velocity = 0.8 m/s, LEMS = 35, distance walked in 6 min = 250 m). Combining the 2 arms, a FIM-L >= 4 was achieved in < 10% of ASIA B patients, 92% of ASIA C patients, and all of ASIA D patients. Walking speed of >= 0.6 m/s correlated with a LEMS near 40 or higher. Conclusions. Few ASIA B and most ASIA C and D patients achieved functional walking ability by the end of 12 weeks of BWSTT and CONT, consistent with the primary outcome data at 6 months. Walking-related measures assessed at 2-week intervals reveal that time after SCI is an important variable for entering patients into a trial with mobility outcomes. By about 6 weeks after entry, most patients who will recover have improved their FIM-L to >3 and are improving in walking speed. Future trials may reduce the number needed to treat by entering patients with FIM-L < 4 at > 8 weeks after onset if still graded ASIA Band at > 12 weeks if still ASIA C.

J	Lamontagne, A; Paquette, C; Fung, J				Lamontagne, Anouk; Paquette, Caroline; Fung, Joyce			Stroke affects the coordination of gaze and posture during preplanned turns while walking	NEUROREHABILITATION AND NEURAL REPAIR			English	Article						cerebrovascular disease; eye movements; locomotion; steering	HEMISPHERIC-ASYMMETRY; BODY REORIENTATION; HEAD; LOCOMOTION; HUMANS; ADULTS; DAMAGE; BRAIN; PATH	Background. In healthy subjects, the act of walking and turning is accomplished by a sequential horizontal reorientation of gaze, head, and body toward the direction of the turn. Subjects with stroke, however, have difficulty altering their walking direction and present with loss of balance when performing a head turn or whole body rotation. Objective. To study, in a pilot case study, the spatial and temporal coordination of gaze and posture during preplanned turns executed while walking in severely disabled and mildly disabled subjects with stroke as compared to a healthy control walking at slow speed. Methods. Horizontal plane orientations of gaze, head, thorax, pelvis, and feet as well as the body's center of mass (CoM) trajectory were analyzed as subjects were walking straight or executing a 90-deg turn. Results. Subjects with stroke revealed altered orientation and sequencing of gaze body segments. These alterations were more pronounced in the most severely disabled subject with stroke, especially when turning to the nonparetic side as compared to the paretic side. Conclusions. These findings suggest an altered coordination of gaze and posture during steering of locomotion in subjects with stroke. This altered coordination is likely due to a complex interaction of motor, sensory, and biomechanical factors that may explain the poor balance and poor control of heading direction during walking and turning in stroke.

After establishing a model of local special gene knockdown, the nociceptive effect of vasopressin receptor subunit in PAG was investigated in the rat. Microinjection of short-interfering RNA (siRNA) into PAG, which targeted vasopressin receptor subtypes (V-1a, V-1b and V-2) locally weakened the associated mRNA expression and depressed the related receptor synthesis in a dose-dependent manner, in which the significant inhibitive effect occurred on from 7th day to 14th day following 1 mu g or 2 mu g siRNA administration. PAG knockdown of V-2 receptor gene markedly decreased pain threshold in from 6th day to 13th day after siRNA administration, whereas local knockdown of either V-1a or V-1b receptor gene could not influence pain threshold. The data suggest that V-2 rather than V-1a and V-1b receptor in PAG involves in nociception. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd and the Japan Neuroscience Society. All rights reserved.

Methods: A 17-year-old girl with T10 meningomyelocele had received an ileocystoplasty, continent catheterizable stoma, and bladder neck sling for neurogenic bladder dysfunction and intractable incontinence 8 years previously. She was continent with clean intermittent self-catheterization four times per day. Yearly urodynamics showed a bladder capacity of up to 700 ml with good compliance and low bladder pressures. In March 2006, filling cystometry was performed. Results: Bladder pressure was normal until 400 ml, after which it increased due to lower compliance. At 620 ml filling, the detrusor pressure was 52 cm H2O, and the patient complained suddenly of abdominal discomfort and bilateral shoulder pain, and the infusion was stopped. A catheter was placed and cystography showed intraperitoneal leakage along the left lateral bladder aspect and at the Mitrofanoff insertion site on the bladder dome. The perforations were closed via a midline incision and a ventriculoperitoneal shunt had to be exteriorized. There were no post-operative complications and a control cystogram revealed no leakage. Conclusions: Augmentation ileocystoplasty has been used extensively in order to increase bladder capacity and decrease intravesical pressure. Although spontaneous or traumatic perforation of the augmented bladder has been described previously, it was never reported in correlation with urodynamic investigation. Extreme caution is warranted in the face of decreased compliance during filling cystometry in these patients, even though urodynamics showed good bladder compliance and low bladder pressures many years after ileocystoplasty.

It is currently estimated that miRNAs account for similar to 1% of predicted genes in higher eukaryotic genomes and that up to 30% of genes might be regulated by miRNAs. However, only very few miRNAs have been functionally characterized and the general functions of miRNAs are not globally studied. In this study, we systematically analyzed the expression patterns of miRNA targets using several public microarray profiles. We found that the expression levels of miRNA targets are lower in all mouse and Drosophila tissues than in the embryos. We also found miRNAs more preferentially target ubiquitously expressed genes than tissue-specifically expressed genes. These results support the current suggestion that miRNAs are likely to be largely involved in embryo development and maintaining of tissue identity.

Cells from bone marrow that evolve into oral tissues and their clinical applications	ORAL DISEASES			English	Review						bone marrow; cell plasticity; cell-based therapies; oral tissues; stem cells; tissue engineering	MESENCHYMAL STEM-CELLS; IN-VIVO; HEMATOPOIETIC-CELLS; EPITHELIAL-CELLS; PROGENITOR CELLS; ENGINEERED BONE; REGENERATION; TRANSPLANTATION; PLASTICITY; PLURIPOTENCY	There are two major well-characterized populations of post-natal (adult) stem cells in bone marrow: hematopoietic stem cells which give rise to blood cells of all lineages, and mesenchymal stem cells which give rise to osteoblasts, adipocytes, and fibroblasts. For the past 50 years, strict rules were taught governing developmental biology. However, recently, numerous studies have emerged from researchers in different fields suggesting the unthinkable - that stem cells isolated from a variety of organs are capable of ignoring their cell lineage boundaries and exhibiting more plasticity in their fates. Plasticity is defined as the ability of post-natal (tissue-specific adult) stem cells to differentiate into mature and functional cells of the same or of a different germ layer of origin. There are reports that bone marrow stem cells can evolve into cells of all dermal lineages, such as hepatocytes, skeletal myocytes, cardiomyocytes, neural, endothelial, epithelial, and even endocrine cells. These findings promise significant therapeutic implications for regenerative medicine. This article will review recent reports of bone marrow cells that have the ability to evolve or differentiate into oral and craniofacial tissues, such as the periodontal ligament, alveolar bone, condyle, tooth, bone around dental and facial implants, and oral mucosa.

Nanomedicine, an emerging discipline, involves the application of nanotechnology (usually regarded within the size range of 1-1000 nm) in the design of systems and devices that can facilitate our understanding of disease pathophysiology, nano-imaging, nanomedicines and nano-diagnostics. Among the different nanomaterials used to construct nanoparticles, are organic polymers, co-polymers and metals. Some of these materials can self assemble, and depending on the conditions under which the self-assembly process occurs, a vast array of shapes can be formed. Frequently, the nanoparticle morphology is spherical or tubular, mimicking the shape, but thus far, not the functions of subcellular organelles. We discuss here several representative nanoparticles, made of block copolymers and metals, highlighting some of their current uses, advantages and limitations in medicine. Nano-oncology and nano-neurosciences will also be discussed in more detail in the context of the intracellular fate of nanoparticles and possible long-term consequences on cell functions.

However, infants at risk for neurologic impairment (NI) have been under studied. Therefore, whether their pain responses are similar to those of other infants is unknown. Pain responses to heel lance from 149 neonates (GA > 25-40 weeks) from 3 Canadian Neonatal Intensive Care units at high (Cohort A, n = 54), moderate (Cohort B, it = 45) and low (Cohort C, it = 50) risk for NI were compared in a prospective observational cohort study. A significant Cohort by Phase interaction for total facial action (F((6.409)) = 3.50, p = 0.0022) and 4 individual facial actions existed; with Cohort C demonstrating the most facial action. A significant Phase effect existed for increased maximum Heart Rate (F((3.431)) = 58.1, p = 0.001), minimum Heart Rate (F((3,43 1)) = 78.7, p = 0.001), maximum Oxygen saturation (F((3,425)) = 47.6, p = 0.001), and minimum oxygen saturation (F((3.425)) = 12.2, p = 0.00 1) with no Cohort differences. Cohort B had significantly higher minimum (F((2, 79)) = 3.71, p = 0.029), and mean (F((2.79)) = 4.04, p = 0.021) fundamental cry frequencies. A significant Phase effect for low/high frequency Heart Rate Variability (HRV) ratio (F((2,216)) = 4.97, p = 0.008) was found with the greatest decrease in Cohort A. Significant Cohort by Phase interactions existed for low and high frequency HRV. All infants responded to the most painful phase of the heel lance; however, infants at moderate and highest risk for NI exhibited decreased responses in some indicators.

Dopamine replacement therapy does not restore the ability of Parkinsonian patients to make rapid adjustments in motor strategies according to changing sensorimotor contexts	PARKINSONISM & RELATED DISORDERS			English	Article						Parkinson's disease; adaptive motor control; dopamine medication; basal ganglia	DORSAL PREMOTOR CORTEX; DISEASE RATING-SCALE; BASAL GANGLIA; METRIC ATTRIBUTES; NEURONAL-ACTIVITY; LEVODOPA; PERTURBATIONS; DYSFUNCTION; ACTIVATION; DISABILITY	The ability of dopamine replacement to restore rapid motor adjustments in Parkinson's disease (PD) was investigated. Medicated and non-medicated patients performed finger-to-nose movements while simultaneously bending the trunk forward, without vision. Trunk motion was blocked unexpectedly, necessitating rapid adjustments in arm trajectories. Patients exhibited irregular hand paths, plateaus in hand velocity, and prolonged movement times, which were significantly greater in perturbed trials.

Dopaminergic replenishment in PD may therefore have limited restorative benefits for rapid context-specific motor control. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This organizational feature allows single STN neurons to act directly upon the two major output structures of the basal ganglia - the substantia nigra pars reticulata and the internal pallidum - and, at the same time, to exert a multifarious effect upon the external pallidum with which the STN is reciprocally connected. These findings have clarified the role of the STN in basal ganglia organization and led to the elaboration of more accurate computational models of deep brain stimulation, a therapeutic approach currently used to alleviate the motor symptoms of Parkinson's Disease.

It is not clear how the brain processes uncertain visual information. We have recorded single cell responses to various visual stimuli in area V4 of the monkey's visual cortex. Different visual patterns are described by their attributes (condition attributes) and placed, together with the decision attributes, in a decision table. Decision attributes are divided into several classes determined by the strength of the neural responses. Small cell responses are classified as class 0, medium to strong responses are classified as classes 1 to n-1 (min(n)=3), and the strongest cell responses are classified as class n. The higher the class of the decision attribute the more preferred is the stimulus. Therefore each cell divides stimuli into its own family of equivalent objects. By comparing responses of different cells we have found related concept classes. However, many different cells show inconsistency between their decision rules, which may suggest that parallel different decision logics may be implemented in the brain.

An extra X chromosome in males (XXY), known as Klinefelter syndrome, is associated with characteristic physical, cognitive, and behavioral features of variable severity. The objective of this study was to examine possible neuroana-tomical substrates of these cognitive and behavioral features during childhood and adolescence. METHODS. MRI brain scans were acquired for 42 XXY and 87 healthy XY age-matched control males. We compared these 2 groups on regional brain volumes and cortical thickness. RESULTS. Total cerebral volume and all lobar volumes except parietal white matter were significantly smaller in the XXY group, whereas lateral-ventricle volume was larger. Consistent with the cognitive profile, the cortex was significantly thinner in the XXY group in left inferior frontal, temporal, and superior motor regions. CONCLUSION. The brain-imaging findings of preferentially affected frontal, temporal, and motor regions and relative sparing of parietal regions are consistent with observed cognitive and behavioral strengths and weaknesses in XXY subjects.

The collarette area is isolated as a personal identification pattern, which captures only the most important areas of iris complex structures, and a better recognition accuracy is achieved. The idea to use the collarette area is that it is less sensitive to the pupil dilation and usually not affected by the eyelids or the eyelashes. The deterministic feature sequence is extracted from the iris images using the 1D log-Gabor wavelet technique and used to train the Support Vector Machine (SVM) as iris pattern classifiers. The parameters of SVM are tuned to improve the overall system performance. Our experimental results also indicate that the performance of SVM as a classifier is far better than the performance of backpropagation neural network (BPNN), K-nearest neighbor (KNN), Hamming distance and Mahalanobis distances. The proposed innovative technique is computationally effective as well as reliable in term of recognition rate of 99.56%.

Then by introducing a lambda degrees r difference operator, an intelligent decoupling control method using multiple models and neural networks (NNs) is developed. The intelligent decoupling control method includes a set of fixed decoupling controllers, a re-initialized neural network (NN) adaptive decoupling controller and a free-running NN adaptive decoupling controller. Theory analysis shows that the free-running NN adaptive decoupling controller can guarantee the bounded-input-bounded-output (BIBO) stability of the closed-loop system, while the multiple fixed decoupling controllers and the re-initialized NN adaptive decoupling controller are used to improve the system performance. To illustrate the method, the proposed design is applied to the 2.4mx2.4m injector driven transonic wind tunnel system. Simulation results show the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed method.

The generalized Prandtl-Ishlinskii (P-I) model is used to describe the characteristics of unknown hysteresis. The challenge addressed here is to fuse the generalized P-I model with controller design without constructing a hysteresis inverse. The Nussbaum-type function is used to solve the problem of unknown control directions and the high-order neural network approximate method is used to overcome the computational complexity. The global stability of the closed-loop system is achieved, and the effectiveness of the proposed control approach is demonstrated through simulation example.

However, it is hard to control effectively with conventional process control strategies due to its complex characteristics. In this paper, an intelligent supervisory control (ISC) approach of GC is developed by employed intelligent techniques, such as Fuzzy and artificial neural network (ANN). This DCS-based ISC system consists of a fuzzy adjustor, an ANN-based GPPS prediction module and an expert interface, and is used to supervise the grinding system and to adjust the setpoints of lower level control loop automatically. The outputs of these loops can therefore track their renewed setpoints so that a desired and optimized GPPS can been achieved. Industrial experiments show the effectiveness of the proposed ISC approach.

An intelligent sensor and actuator fault detection and isolation scheme for nonlinear systems	PROCEEDINGS OF THE 46TH IEEE CONFERENCE ON DECISION AND CONTROL, VOLS 1-14	IEEE Conference on Decision and Control		English	Proceedings Paper	46th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control	DEC 12-14, 2007	New Orleans, LA	IEEE Control Syst Soc, United Technol, Springer, Wiley Blackwell, Taylor & Francis, Princeton Univ Press, Maplesoft, Siam			MANIPULATORS	This paper presents a robust Fault Detection and Isolation (FDI) scheme for a general nonlinear system using a neural network-based observer. Both actuator and sensor faults are considered. The nonlinear system is subject to state and sensor uncertainties and disturbances. Two recurrent neural networks are employed to identify general unknown actuator and sensor faults. The neural network weights are updated according to a modified backpropagation scheme. Unlike many previous methods in the literature, the proposed FDI scheme does not rely on the availability of full state measurements. The stability of the overall fault detection scheme in presence of unknown sensor and actuator faults as well as plant and sensor uncertainties is shown by using Lyapunov's direct method. The stability analysis presented imposes no restrictive assumptions or constraints on the system and/or the FDI algorithm. Magnetorquer type actuators and Magnetometer type sensors that are commonly utilized in the attitude determination and control of Low-Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites are considered as case studies. The effectiveness of our proposed fault diagnosis strategy is demonstrated through numerical simulations.	[Talebi, H.

The proposed FDI scheme employs a neural network-based observer for detecting and identifying the severity of actuator gain faults in the presence of disturbances and uncertainties in the model and sensory measurements. The neural network weights are updated based on a modified dynamic backpropagation scheme. The proposed FDI scheme does not rely on the availability of full state measurements. In most work in the literature, the fault function acts as an additive (bias) term, whereas in our scheme the fault function acts as a multiplicative (gain) term. This representation makes the stability analysis of the overall FDI scheme rather challenging. Stability properties of the proposed fault detection scheme in the presence of unknown actuator gain faults as well as plant and sensor uncertainties are demonstrated by using Lyapunov's direct method with no restrictive assumptions on the system and/or the FDI algorithm. The performance of our proposed FDI approach is evaluated through simulations performed on a reaction wheel type actuator that is commonly employed in the attitude control subsystem (ACS) of a satellite.

Moreover the common design parameters inmost cases are not the variables used in shape optimization, hence the designer does not have control over the parameters that he or she uses in the design. In this work, the turbine blade shape at any given radial location, is represented with the MRATD model (Modified Rapid Axial Turbine Design), which is a low-order representation that describes the blade profile using a maximum of 17 aerodynamic design parameters that are given (and used) by the turbine designer, e.g. the blade axial chord, stagger maximum thickness, throat, uncovered turning, inlet and exit blade and wedge angles, LE and TE radii etc... This representation is used in an optimization scheme to sweep the design space and identify the design parameters that would accomplish a certain optimization objective (e.g. maximum adiabatic efficiency) subject to some constraints (e.g. fixed throat area or minimum TE radius or maximum TE wedge angle or metal angles etc...). The optimization scheme uses evolutionary optimization algorithm, Genetic Algorithm(GA) and, to save computing time, Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is introduced to approximate the optimization objectives and constraints; it is trained and tested using a relatively small number of high fidelity CFD flow simulations. This approach to geometry representation is used to carry out a sensitivity study of the effect of the different design parameters on the blade performance of a highly efficient subsonic turbine blade. Its impact on the design process is also demonstrated.

Brain differences visualized in the blind using tensor manifold statistics and diffusion tensor imaging	PROCEEDINGS OF THE FRONTIERS IN THE CONVERGENCE OF BIOSCIENCE AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES			English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Frontiers in the Convergence of Bioscience and Information Technologies	OCT 11-13, 2007	Cheju Isl, SOUTH KOREA				IMAGES; REGISTRATION; MORPHOMETRY; FRAMEWORK; CALCULUS; MRI	Diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DTI) reveals the local orientation and integrity of white matter fiber structure based on imaging multidirectional water diffusion. Group differences in DTI images are often computed from single scalar measures, e.g., the Fractional Anisotropy (FA), discarding much of the information in the 6-parameter symmetric diffusion tensor. Here, we compute multivariate 6D tensor statistics to detect brain morphological changes in 12 blind subjects versus 14 sighted controls. After Log-Euclidean tensor denoising, images were fluidly registered to a common template. Fluidly-convected tensor signals were re-oriented by applying the local rotational and translational component of the deformation. Since symmetric, positive-definite matrices form a non-Euclidean manifold, we applied a Riemannian manifold version of the Hotelling's T-2 test to the logarithms of the tensors, using a log-Euclidean metric. Statistics on the full 6D tensor-valued images outperformed univariate analysis of scalar images, such as the FA and the geodesic anisotropy (GA).

This study has adopted an experimentation in which participants were exposed to a set of pictures from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS) while their electrical brain activity was recorded with an electroencephalogram (EEG). The pictures were already rated in a previous study via the affective rating system Self-Assessment Manikin (SAM) to assess the three dimensions of pleasure, arousal, and dominance. For each picture, we took the mean of these values for all subjects used in this previous study and associated them to the recorded brainwaves of the participants in our study. Correlation and regression analyses confirmed the hypothesis that brainwave measures could significantly predict emotional dimensions. This can be very useful in the case of impassive, taciturn or disabled learners. Standard classification techniques were used to assess the reliability of the automatic detection of learners' three major dimensions from the brainwaves. We discuss the results and the pertinence of such a method to assess learner's emotions and integrate it into a brainwave-sensing Intelligent Tutoring System.

The role of cortico-subcortical pathways underlying postural control, including cerebellum and its afferents (climbing, mossy, and noradrenergic fibers), basal ganglia, motor thalamus, and parieto-frontal neocortex has been identified in animal models, notably through the brain lesion technique in rats and in mice with spontaneous and induced mutations. These studies are complemented by analyses of the factors underlying postural deficiencies in patients with cerebellar atrophy. With the gene deletion technique in mice, specific genes expressed in cerebellum encoding glutamate receptors (Grid2 and Grm1) and other molecules (Prkcc, Cntn6, Klf9, S yt4, and En2) have also been shown to affect postural control. In addition, transgenic mouse models of the synucleinopathies and of Huntington's disease cause deficiencies of motor coordination resembling those of patients with basal ganglia damage.

Participants were evaluated by clinical interview and the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview. Reliability was assessed by factor analysis and Cronbach's alpha. The 3-factor model's replication was tested using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). Controls were reevaluated after 4 months to assess test-retest reliability. Subsamples were also evaluated using the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory and Defensive Functioning Scale (DFS). Factor analysis of the various defense mechanisms produced a distribution of mechanisms among the factors that was largely similar to previous analyses based on the original instrument. The 3-factor model was supported by CFA. The test-retest evaluation showed sufficient intraclass correlation for all factors. Patients used more immature and neurotic defenses than controls. There was a correlation between DFS and immature defenses. Individuals with pathological personality traits scored higher on the immature and neurotic factors than those without. The Brazilian-Portuguese version of the DSQ-40 has psychometric features that allow the use of this instrument in our culture.

However, it is not clear how this information is processed. We will analyze brain responses using machine learning methods based on rough set theory. We will test the expertise of the visual area V4, which is responsible for shape classifications. Characteristic of each stimulus are treated as a set of learning attributes. We assume that bottom-up information is related to hypotheses, while top-down information is related to predictions. Therefore, neuronal responses are divided into three categories. Category 0 occurs if cell response is below 20 spikes/s (sp/s), indicating that the hypothesis is not valid. Category I occurs if cell activity is higher than 20 spikes, implying the hypothesis is valid. Category 2 occurs if cell response is above 40 sp/s; in this case we conclude that the hypothesis and prediction are valid. By using experimental data we make a decision table for each cell, and generate equivalence classes. We express the brains basic concepts by means of the learners basic categories. By approximating stimulus categories with concepts of different cells we determine core properties of cells, and differences between them. On this basis we have created profiles of their receptive field properties.

Interestingly, the amplitude of the N400 event-related brain potential (ERP) has been proposed as an index of the integration of information that is discrepant with expectancies whatever the task in which the potential is found. Thus, delusions may persist because of a deficit in integration as indexed by the N400. To test this hypothesis, ERPs were recorded in 35 schizophrenia patients (mean age = 30.5 +/- 5.6 years) and 26 normal controls during a task in which they either had to decide whether or not each target word could be integrated into the category "animal", or had no decision to make, according to the prompt "animal?" or the prompt "inaction". In these conditions, the amplitudes of the N400s to target words that were discrepant with the category were found to be negatively correlated with delusion severity. The patient group was then dichotomized according to a median split of delusion severity, excluding the 5 patients with delusion scores at the median. Mean age, sex ratio, and severity of conceptual disorganization and hallucinations of the two subgroups differed. Controlling for these 4 covariates, the N400s for discrepant targets were found smaller in the 14 More-Delusional patients than in the 16 Less-Delusional patients. These results support the hypothesis that delusions are associated with smaller N400s in patients. Further studies should thus be done to test whether a deficit of N400 processes could have a causal role in the persistence of delusions. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The left lingual nerve was transected in adult male rats by an oral surgical procedure; sham rats (oral surgery but no nerve transection) as well as naive intact rats served as control groups. ICMS was applied at post-operative days 0, 7, 14, 21, and 28 to map the jaw and tongue motor representations in face MI by analyzing ICMS-evoked movements and electromyographic activity recorded in the genioglossus (GG) and anterior digastric (AD) muscles. There were no statistically significant effects of acute ( day 0) nerve transection or sham procedure (p40.05). The surgery in the sham animals was associated with limited post-operative change; this was reflected in a significant (p50.05) increase in the number of GG sites in left MI at post-operative day 14 compared to day 0. However, nerve transection was associated with significant increases in the total number of AD and GG sites in left or right MI or specifically the number of GG sites in rats at post-operative days 21 or 28 compared to earlier time periods. There were also significant differences between nerve-transected and sham groups at post-operative days 7, 14, or 21. These findings suggest that lingual nerve transection is associated with significant time-dependent neuroplastic changes in the tongue motor representations in face MI.

Method: A computerized search of numerous databases from 1966 forward was completed. Measured outcomes included voluntary driving cessation or results of on-road driving evaluation. Studies were evaluated using the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale. Results: 17 eligible studies were identified. The most useful screening tests were tests assessing cognitive abilities. These included the Trail Making A and B tests, the Rey-Osterreith Complex Figure Design, and the Useful Field of View Test. Conclusion: Cognitive tests that assess multiple cognitive domains relevant to driving appear to have the best reproducibility in predicting fitness to drive in stroke patients.

Here, we review recent evidence that certain types of transcription factor of the nuclear receptor family, specifically Nur77 and retinoid X receptors, have important roles in adaptation and homeostatic regulation of dopaminergic systems. These findings call for a reassessment of our fundamental understanding of the molecular and cellular basis of dopamine-mediated transmission. Given that diseases such as Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia are thought to involve adaptation of dopamine signalling, these findings might provide new insight into these pathologies and offer new avenues for drug development.

Complex motion selectivity in PMLS cortex following early lesions of primary visual cortex in the cat	VISUAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						electrophysiology; neuronal reorganization; thalamo-cortical loops; cortico-cortical connectivity; plasticity	LATERAL SUPRASYLVIAN CORTEX; POSTERIOR-PULVINAR COMPLEX; MIDDLE TEMPORAL AREA; NEW-WORLD MONKEYS; STRIATE CORTEX; MACAQUE MONKEY; RESPONSE PROPERTIES; GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; EXTRASTRIATE CORTEX; FUNCTIONAL COMPENSATION	In the cat, the analysis of visual motion cues has generally been attributed to the posteromedial lateral suprasylvian cortex (PMLS) (Toyama et al., 1985; Rauschecker et al., 1987; Rauschecker, 1988; Kim et al., 1997). The responses of neurons in this area are not critically dependent on inputs from the primary visual cortex (VC), as lesions of VC leave neuronal response properties in PMLS relatively unchanged (Spear & Baumann, 1979; Spear, 1988; Guido et al., 1990b). However, previous studies have used a limited range of visual stimuli. In this study, we assessed whether neurons in PMLS cortex remained direction-selective to complex motion stimuli following a lesion of VC, particularly to complex random dot kinematograms (RDKs). Unilateral aspiration of VC was performed on post-natal days 7-9. Single unit extracellular recordings were performed one year later in the ipsilateral PMLS cortex. As in previous studies, a reduction in the percentage of direction selective neurons was observed with drifting sinewave gratings. We report a previously unobserved phenomenon with sinewave gratings, in which there is a greater modulation of firing rate at the temporal frequency of the stimulus in animals with a lesion of VC, suggesting an increased segregation of ON and OFF sub-regions. A significant portion of neurons in PMLS cortex were direction selective to simple (16/18) and complex (11/16) RDKs. However, the strength of direction selectivity to both stimuli was reduced as compared to normals. The data suggest that complex motion processing is still present, albeit reduced, in PMLS cortex despite the removal of VC input. The complex RDK motion selectivity is consistent with both geniculo-cortical and extra-geniculate thalamo-cortical pathways in residual direction encoding.

Here we explore whether single neurons in early visual cortex can process both contrast and texture cues. We recorded neural responses in cat A 18 to both illusory contours formed by abutting gratings (ICs, texture-defined) and contrast-modulated ratings (CMs, contrast-defined). We found that if a neuron responded to one of the two stimuli, it also responded to the other. These neurons signaled similar contour orientation, spatial frequency, and movement direction of the two stimuli. A given neuron also exhibited similar selectivity for spatial frequency of the fine, stationary grating components (carriers) of the stimuli. These results suggest that the cue-invariance of early cortical neurons extends to different kinds of texture or contrast cues, and might arise from a common nonlinear mechanism.

Effects of pelvic, pudendal, or hypogastric nerve cuts on Fos induction in the rat brain following vaginocervical stimulation	PHYSIOLOGY & BEHAVIOR			English	Article						sexual stimulation; female; genitosensory; neurectomy; estrogen; progesterone	CONSUMMATORY SEXUAL-BEHAVIORS; CONDITIONED PLACE PREFERENCE; MEDIAL PREOPTIC LESIONS; FEMALE RATS; LORDOSIS REFLEX; C-FOS; VAGINAL STIMULATION; VENTROMEDIAL HYPOTHALAMUS; REPRODUCTIVE-BEHAVIOR; SUCCESSFUL PREGNANCY	In the female rat, genitosensory input is conveyed to the central nervous system predominantly through the pelvic, pudendal, and hypogastric nerves. The present study examined the relative contribution of those three nerves in the expression of Fos immunoreactivity within brain regions previously shown to be activated by vaginocervical stimulation (VCS). Bilateral transection of those nerves, or sham neurectomy, was conducted in separate groups of ovariectomized, sexually-experienced females. After recovery, females were primed with estrogen and progesterone and given either 50 manual VCSs with a lubricated glass rod over the course of 1 h. VCS increased the number of neurons expressing Fos immunoreactivity in the medial preoptic area, lateral septum, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, ventromedial hypothalamus, and medial amygdala of sham neurectomized females. Transection of the pelvic nerve reduced Fos immunoreactivity in the medial preoptic area, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, ventromedial hypothalamus, and medial amygdala, whereas transection of the pudendal nerve had no effect. In contrast, transection of the hypogastric nerve increased Fos immunoreactivity in the medial preoptic area and lateral septum, whereas transaction of the pelvic nerve increased Fos immunoreactivity in the lateral septum, following VCS. All females given VCS, except those with pelvic neurectomy, displayed a characteristic immobility during each application. These data confirm that the pelvic nerve is largely responsible for the neural and behavioral effects of VCS, and support a separate function for the hypogastric nerve. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Speech perception is likely to have evolved in our ancestors on the basis of pre-existing neural mechanisms involved in extracting behaviourally relevant information from conspecific vocalizations ( CVs). Studying the neural bases of voice perception in primates thus not only has the potential to shed light on cerebral mechanisms that may be - unlike those involved in speech perception - directly homologous between species, but also has direct implications for our understanding of how speech appeared in humans. In this comparative review, we focus on behavioural and neurobiological evidence relative to two issues central to voice perception in human and non-human primates: (i) are CVs 'special', i. e. are they analysed using dedicated cerebral mechanisms not used for other sound categories, and (ii) to what extent and using what neural mechanisms do primates identify conspecific individuals from their vocalizations?

Stereological estimates of the basal forebrain cell population in the rat, including neurons containing choline acetyltransferase, glutamic acid decarboxylase or phosphate-activated glutaminase and colocalizing vesicular glutamate transporters	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						diagonal band; medial septum; magnocellular preoptic nucleus; substantia innominata; globus pallidus	CEREBRAL-CORTEX; GABAERGIC NEURONS; INHIBITORY INTERNEURONS; LATERAL HYPOTHALAMUS; SYNAPTIC VESICLES; SPECIAL EMPHASIS; DIAGONAL BAND; GRANULE CELLS; BRAIN-STEM; LOCALIZATION	The basal forebrain (BF) plays an important role in modulating cortical activity and influencing attention, learning and memory. These activities are fulfilled importantly yet not entirely by cholinergic neurons. Noncholinergic neurons also contribute and comprise GABAergic neurons and other possibly glutamatergic neurons. The aim of the present study was to estimate the total number of cells in the BF of the rat and the proportions of that total represented by cholinergic, GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons. For this purpose, cells were counted using unbiased stereological methods within the medial septum, diagonal band, magnocellular preoptic nucleus, substantia innominata and globus pallidus in sections stained for Nissl substance and/or the neurotransmitter enzymes, choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) or phosphate-activated glutaminase (PAG). In Nissl-stained sections, the total number of neurons in the BF was estimated as similar to 355,000 and the numbers of ChAT-immuno-positive (+) as similar to 22,000, GAD+ similar to 119,000 and PAG+ similar to 316,000, corresponding to similar to 5%, similar to 35% and similar to 90% of the total. Thus, of the large population of BF neurons, only a small proportion has the capacity to synthesize acetylcholine (ACh), one third to synthesize GABA and the vast majority to synthesize glutamate (Glu). Moreover, through the presence of PAG, a proportion of ACh- and GABA-synthesizing neurons also has the capacity to synthesize Glu. In sections dual fluorescent immunostained for vesicular transporters, vesicular glutamate transporter (VGluT) 3 and not VGluT2 was present in the cell bodies of most PAG+ and ChAT+ and half the GAD+ cells. Given previous results showing that VGluT2 and not VGluT3 was present in BF axon terminals and not colocalized with VAChT or VGAT, we conclude that the BF cell population influences cortical and subcortical regions through neurons which release ACh, GABA or Glu from their terminals but which in part can also synthesize and release Glu from their soma or dendrites.

Several studies have also described internal modes of PDZ recognition, most of which depend on beta-finger structures. Here, we describe a novel interaction between the PDZ domain of nNOS and Vac 14, the activator of the PtdIns(3)P 5-kinase PIKfyve. Binding assays using various Vac14 deletion constructs revealed a beta-finger independent interaction that is based on a novel internal motif. Mutational analyses reveal essential residues within the motif allowing us to define a new type of PDZ domain interaction. (c) 2006 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.

Connecdenn, a novel DENN domain-containing protein of neuronal clathrin-coated vesicles functioning in synaptic vesicle endocytosis	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						AP-2; clathrin; DENN domains; endocytosis; endophilin; intersectin; NMR; synaptic vesicle	MEDIATED ENDOCYTOSIS; HIPPOCAMPAL-NEURONS; ACCESSORY PROTEINS; MEMBRANE CURVATURE; RNA INTERFERENCE; NERVE-TERMINALS; ALPHA-APPENDAGE; CARGO SELECTION; ADAPTER; BINDING	Clathrin- coated vesicles ( CCVs) are responsible for the endocytosis of multiple cargo, including synaptic vesicle membranes. We now describe anewCCVprotein, termed connecdenn, that contains an N- terminalDENN( differentially expressed in neoplastic versus normal cells) domain, a poorly characterized protein module found in multiple proteins of unrelated function and a C- terminal peptide motif domain harboring three distinct motifs for binding the alpha-ear of the clathrin adaptor protein 2 ( AP- 2). Connecdenn coimmunoprecipitates and partially colocalizes with AP- 2, and nuclear magnetic resonance and peptide competition studies reveal that all three alpha-earbinding motifs contribute to AP- 2 interactions. In addition, connecdenn contains multiple Src homology 3 ( SH3) domain- binding motifs and coimmunoprecipitates with the synaptic SH3 domain proteins intersectin and endophilin A1. Interestingly, connecdenn is enriched on neuronal CCVs and is present in the presynaptic compartment of neurons. Moreover, connecdenn has a uniquely stable association with CCV membranes because it resists extraction with Tris and high- salt buffers, unlike most other CCV proteins, but it is not detected on purified synaptic vesicles. Together, these observations suggest that connecdenn functions on the endocytic limb of the synaptic vesicle cycle. Accordingly, disruption of connecdenn interactions with its binding partners through overexpression of the C- terminal peptide motif domain or knock down of connecdenn through lentiviral delivery of small hairpin RNA both lead to defects in synaptic vesicle endocytosis in cultured hippocampal neurons. Thus, we identified connecdenn as a component of the endocytic machinery functioning in synaptic vesicle endocytosis, providing the first evidence of a role for a DENN domain- containing protein in endocytosis.

Follitropin receptor knockout (FORKO) mice are sterile and have age-dependent abnormalities including increased ovarian tumor incidence. To explore why atrophic ovaries of FORKO mice become tumorigenic later in life, we compared gene expression profiles by microarray at different ages. Here we show an unexpected ovarian expression of GDNF and its bimodal regulation. GDNF was down-regulated at a young age but up-regulated in aging FORKO mice prior to tumor appearance. Immunohistochemistry localized GDNF in the oocyte as well as somatic granulosa and stromal cells. GDNF protein also showed an age-dependent increase in the ovary, being lower in young mutants and increasing by 6 months. We found evidence for GDNF upregulation in GC tumors and a potential role for androgen. The peripheral expression pattern and functions of this powerful neurotropic factor suggest mediation of processes involved in pathology of ovarian compartments. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Development of influenza drug resistance is an important problem in immunocompromised children that could result in treatment failure and viral transmission to others. Methods. A total of 17 influenza A/H3N2 isolates were recovered over a period of 1 year from an immunocompromised child who was initially treated with oseltamivir and then with amantadine and zanamivir for viral pneumonitis. Drug susceptibility phenotypes to oseltamivir, zanamivir, and peramivir were evaluated by neuraminidase (NA) inhibition assays, and sequence analysis of key viral genes (i.e., M2, NA, and hemagglutinin [HA]) was performed. The impact of NA mutations identified in oseltamivir-resistant isolates was analyzed using recombinant NA proteins. Results. An influenza A variant with NA mutations E59G, E119V, and I222V was first detected after 38 days of oseltamivir treatment. In an NA inhibition assay, this variant was 274 times more resistant to oseltamivir than the original isolate but was susceptible to zanamivir. The I222V substitution enhanced the level of oseltamivir resistance that was primarily conferred by the E119V mutation in recombinant NA proteins. Remarkably, the E119V mutation persisted for 8 months after cessation of oseltamivir. Amantadine therapy led to rapid emergence of the M2 mutation S31N, which is known to confer amantadine resistance. The patient shed the virus intermittently while receiving nebulized zanamivir therapy despite the absence of a resistance phenotype, which could be the result of nonoptimal drug delivery and impaired host immunity. Conclusions. This study highlights the potential for emergence and persistence of multidrug-resistant influenza isolates in immunocompromised subjects even after cessation of treatment, reinforcing the need for development of new anti-influenza compounds.

Hippi is essential for node cilia assembly and Sonic hedgehog signaling	DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY			English	Article						cilia; Hippi; Huntington disease; left-right patterning; Sonic hedgehog	LEFT-RIGHT ASYMMETRY; LEFT-RIGHT AXIS; KINESIN SUPERFAMILY PROTEIN; INTRAFLAGELLAR TRANSPORT; FLOOR PLATE; GLI PROTEINS; HUNTINGTONS-DISEASE; RETINOIC ACID; MUTANT MICE; NEURAL-TUBE	Hippi functions as an adapter protein that mediates pro-apoptotic signaling from poly-glutamine-expanded huntingtin, an established cause of Huntington disease, to the extrinsic cell death pathway. To explore other functions of Hippi we generated Hippi knock-out mice. This deletion causes randomization of the embryo turning process and heart looping, which are hallmarks of defective left-right (LR) axis patterning. We report that motile monocilia normally present at the surface of the embryonic node, and proposed to initiate the break in LR symmetry, are absent on Hippi(-/-) embryos. Furthermore, defects in central nervous system development are observed. The Sonic hedgehog (Shh) pathway is downregulated in the neural tube in the absence of Hippi, which results in failure to establish ventral neural cell fate. Together, these findings demonstrate a dual role for Hippi in cilia assembly and Shh signaling during development, in addition to its proposed role in apoptosis signal transduction in the adult brain under pathogenically stressful conditions.

Here, we studied the role of the CNTF/LIF signaling pathway during mouse retinal development in vivo. We show that exposure to CNTF during neonatal retinal development in vivo retards rhodopsin expression and results in an important and specific deficit in photoreceptor cells. Detailed analysis revealed that exposure to CNTF during retinal development causes a sharp increase in cell death of postmitotic rod precursor cells. Importantly, we show that blocking the CNTF/LIF signaling pathway during mouse retinal development ill vivo results in a significant reduction of naturally occurring cell death. Using retroviral lineage analysis, we demonstrate that exposure to CNTF causes a specific reduction of clones containing only rods without affecting other clone types, whereas blocking the CNTF/LIF receptor complex causes a specific increase of clones containing only rods. In addition, we show that stimulation of the CNTF/LIF pathway positively regulates the expression of the neuronal and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (NOS) genes, and blocking nitric oxide production by pre-treatment with a NOS inhibitor abolishes CNTF-induced cell death. Taken together, these results indicate that the CNTF/LIF signaling pathway acts via regulation of nitric oxide production to modulate developmental programmed cell death of postmitotic rod precursor cells.

At the cellular level, the Pax6 mutation was reported to affect homophilic and heterophilic cellular adhesion, neuron polarity and neurite outgrowth. These abnormalities were observed in multiple regions of Pax6-mutant CNS, suggesting a common function for Pax6 in regulating cytoskeletal dynamics. However, target genes mediating Pax6 function in cytoskeletal dynamics remain largely unknown. Using DNA microarrays, we identified delta-catenin (delta-catenin / neurojugin) as a potential direct target of Pax6 in the CNS. delta-catenin encodes a large cytoskeletal protein that localizes at adherens junction in the CNS and that can modulate neurite outgrowth and N-cadherin turnover. delta-catenin was found to be co-expressed with Pax6 in several regions of the developing CNS. In Pax6 mutant embryos, delta-catenin expression was severely reduced in the optic vesicle neural ectoderm, in the ventricular zone of the neocortex and in the external granule layer of the cerebellum. We identified a Pax6 binding site in delta-catenin promoter that is conserved between mice and humans and which is effectively bound by Pax6 in vitro. Our results suggest that Pax6 regulates delta-catenin expression during CNS development in mice. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Previous evidence suggests that spinal release of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and activation of its receptors contribute to opioid physical dependence. The release of CGRP at the spinal level is modulated by cannabinoid (CB1)-receptors. Thus, this study examined whether CB1-receptor activity mediates changes in CGRP underlying development of opioid physical dependence. Systemic morphine administration for 5-days elevated CGRP-immunoreactivity in the rat spinal dorsal horn. In situ hybridization of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons revealed an increase in CGRP mRNA during initial (day 1-3) but not later phase (day 4-5) of morphine treatment. CGRP-immunoreactivity in DRG neurons, however, was increased in the later phase of morphine treatment. Naloxone challenge to morphine-treated animals precipitated an intense withdrawal syndrome that depleted CGRP-immunoreactivity and increased Fos expression in the dorsal horn. The Fos-response primarily occurred in neurons that expressed CGRP receptor component protein (RCP) suggesting CGRP activity contributes to neuronal activation during precipitated withdrawal. Spinal slices obtained from morphine-treated animals showed higher levels of CGRP release than from saline controls. Intrathecal co-administration of CB1-receptor antagonists, AM-251 or SR141716A, with daily morphine attenuated the behavioral manifestations of withdrawal. Treatment with AM-251 also reduced the depletion of CGRP, suppressed Fos-induction, and prevented the increase in capsaicin-evoked spinal CGRP release. Altogether, this study suggests that endocannabinoid activity, expressed via CB1-receptors, contributes to the induction of opioid physical dependence through spinal modulation of CGRP.

Yet. little is known about the neurobiological basis for the communication of pain. Here, subjects performed a sex-discrimination task while we investigated neural responses to implicit processing of dynamic visual stimuli of male or female faces displaying pain or angry expressions, matched on expression intensity and compared to neutral expression. Stimuli were presented in a mixed blocked/event-related design while blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal was acquired using whole-brain functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) at 1.5 Tesla. Comparable sustained responses to pain and angry faces were found in the superior temporal sulcus (STS). Stronger transient activation was also observed to male expression of pain (Vs neutral and anger) in high-order visual areas (STS and fusiform face area) and in emotion-related areas including the amygdala (highest peak t-value = 10.8), perigenual anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and SI. Male pain compared to anger expression also activated the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, SII/posterior insula and anterior insula. This is consistent with the hypothesis that the implicit processing of male pain expression triggers an emotional reaction characterized by a threat-related response. Unexpectedly, several areas responsive to male expression, including the amygdala, perigenual ACC, and somatosensory areas, showed a decrease in activation to female pain faces (Vs neutral). This sharp contrast in the response to male and female faces suggests potential differences in the socio-functional role of pain expression in males and females.

We examined whether the temporal pattern of N400 adaptation due to within-language repetitions (i.e., repetition priming) was similar in L1 and L2 and whether the release from adaptation elicited by a within-language word change was similar. Furthermore, using word changes across language, we examined the phonological mismatch negativity (PMN) and N400 components to determine the kind of information activated during translation priming. In contrast to within-language repetition, we expected between-language repetition (i.e., translations) to be characterized by conceptual rather than lexical/phonological word form priming. Overall, the pattern of adaptation and release from adaptation was similar in L1 and L2, with evidence of delayed semantic analysis in L2 in the form of a later N400 effect. A change in language (L1 to L2) elicited a similar pattern of PMN and N400 activity compared to a Within-language change in meaning in L1, suggesting that neither word form nor conceptual information was available on-line for the forward translation. In contrast, the presence of strong PMN but minimal N400 effects for L2-to-L1 translations suggests that conceptual but not phonological information is available on-line for backwards translation. L2 proficiency influenced the extent to which conceptual representations were activated by translations. These data are discussed in light of current models of bilingual word processing and suggest modality differences in the pattern of activation of lexical and conceptual information.

In rodents, the relationships between sleep and memory consolidation have been extensively investigated by taking into account mainly spatial learning. On the contrary, in humans the relationship between sleep and spatial memory consolidation has so far been scarcely taken into account. Here, we investigated the importance of sleep in the consolidation of the spatial memory traces of a new route learned in a real-life unfamiliar environment. Fifty-one subjects followed a defined route in a neighbourhood they had never been to before. Then, they were tested in the laboratory in a sequence-recognition test requiring them to evaluate whether or not sequences of three views, taken along the route, represented a correct sequential order as seen while walking along the route. Participants were then assigned to one of three groups: the sleep group was retested after one night's sleep, the sleep-deprived group was retested after a night of sleep deprivation, and the day-control group was retested the same day after 8 h of wakefulness. At retest, performance speed increased in all groups, whereas the accuracy in the sequence-recognition task was improved only in the sleep group: neither sleep deprivation nor the simple passage of time gave way to any performance improvement. These preliminary findings shed more light on the role of sleep in spatial memory consolidation by extending to humans the considerable evidence found in animals.(c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Present work investigated that AVP effect on PAG secretion and synthesis of enkephalin and endorphin in vitro. Radioimmunoassy results showed that AVP increased leucine-enkephalin (L-Ek), methionine-enkephalin (M-Ek), beta-endorphin (beta-Ep) rather than dynorphin A(1-13) (DynA(1-13)) concentrations in PAG slice culture liquid, and V-2 receptor antagonist: d(CH2)(5)[D-Ile(2), Ile(4), Ala(9)-NH2]AVP decreased L-Ek, M-Ek and beta-Ep, not DynA(1-13) concentrations in PAG slice culture liquid in a dose-dependent manner, but V, receptor antagonist: d(CH2)(5)Tyr(Me)AVP did not change these peptide concentrations in PAG slice culture liquid. RT-PCR data displayed that AVP enhanced proenkephalin and proopiomelanocortin (Pro-beta-Ep) rather than prodynorphin mRNA expressions in culture PAG tissues, and V2 receptor antagonist weakened proenkephalin and proopiomelanocortin (Pro-beta-Ep), not prodynorphin mRNA expressions in culture PAG tissues, but V, receptor antagonist did not influence these mRNA expressions in culture PAG tissues. The data suggest that AVP enhances PAG synthesizing and secreting enkephalin and endorphin rather than dynorphin through V-2 receptors. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The nociceptive effect of AVP in PAG was investigated in the rat. The results showed that microinjection of AVP into PAG increased pain threshold, whereas microinjection of V-2 receptor antagonist-d(CH2)(5)[D-Ile(2), Ile(4), Ala(9)-NH2]AVP into PAG decreased pain threshold in a dose-dependent manner, but local administration of V-1 receptor antagonist-d(CH2)(5)Tyn(Me)AVP did not change pain threshold; Pain stimulation elevated AVP, Leucine-enkephalin (L-Ek), Methionine-enkephalin (M-Ek) and beta-endorphin (beta-Ep), not dynorphinA(1-13) (DynA(1-13)) concentrations in PAG perfuse liquid; PAG pre-treatment with naloxone, an opiate receptor antagonist or V-2 receptor antagonist completely reversed AVP-induced increase in pain threshold, however, PAG pre-treatment with V-1 receptor antagonist did not influence this effect of AVP administration.

There is growing appreciation that signaling through Toll-like receptors (TLRs), which is key to generating innate responses to infection, may have pathogen-independent roles. We show that TLR2 was selectively upregulated by microglia in the denervated zones of the hippocampus in response to stereotactic transection of axons in the entorhinal cortex. In mice lacking TLR2, there were transient, selective reductions in lesion-induced expression of cytokines and chemokines. Recruitment of T cells, but not macrophages, was delayed in TLR2-deficient mice, as well as in mice lacking TNFR1 (tumor necrosis factor receptor 1). TLR2 deficiency also affected microglial proliferative expansion, whereas all of these events were unaffected in TLR4-mutant mice. Consistent with the fact that responses in knock-out mice had all returned to wild-type levels by 8 d, there was no evidence for effects on neuronal plasticity at 20 d. These results identify a role for TLR2 signaling in the early glial response to brain injury, acting as an innate bridge to neuroinflammation.

(R,S)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine (DHPG). Spontaneous nociceptive behaviours (SNBs), mechanical allodynia (von Frey thresholds) and heat hyperalgesia (plantar test latencies) induced by DHPG were measured in animals pretreated i.t. with membrane permeable inhibitors of ERK (PD 98059) and PKC (GF 109203X). Spinal administration of PD 98059 dose-dependently reduced SNBs, and attenuated both mechanical allodynia and heat hyperalgesia induced by DHPG. GF 109203X treatment also reduced SNBs and heat hyperalgesia, but did not affect mechanical allodynia induced by DHPG. Neither PD 98059, nor GF 109203X, altered mechanical or thermal thresholds in saline-injected control rats. These results suggest that both ERK and PKC are involved in persistent pain associated with the i.t. administration of DHPG. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, neuropsychiatric complications, including mood and anxiety disorders, fatigue, apathy, psychosis, cognitive impairment, dementia, sleep disorders and addictions, frequently complicate the course of the illness. The pathophysiologic features of these complications are multifaceted and include neuropathophysiologic changes of a degenerative disease, exposure to antiparkinsonian treatments and emotional reactions to having a disabling chronic illness. Changes in mental status have profound implications for the well-being of patients with Parkinson's disease and of their caregivers. Treatment is often efficacious but becomes a challenge in advanced stages of Parkinson's disease. In this article, we review the key clinical features of neuropsychiatric complications in Parkinson's disease as well as what is known about their epidemiologic characteristics, risk factors, pathophysiologic features and management.

Quantitative analysis of human endogenous retrovirus-W env in neuroinflammatory diseases	AIDS RESEARCH AND HUMAN RETROVIRUSES			English	Article							SCLEROSIS-ASSOCIATED RETROVIRUS; VIRUS TYPE-1 DNA; MULTIPLE-SCLEROSIS; PRIMATE EVOLUTION; HERV-W; MOLECULAR CHARACTERIZATION; ENVELOPE GLYCOPROTEIN; GENE; EXPRESSION; FAMILY	Although human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs) constitute 8% of the human genome, their role(s) in health and disease remain uncertain. Nonetheless, increased HERV gene activity has been reported in neuroinflammatory diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS). The human endogenous retrovirus (HERV)-W7q envelope gene encodes a glycosylated envelope protein, syncytin-1, which is expressed in many tissues. Analysis of HERV envelopes (env) revealed a selectively increased abundance of syncytin-1 encoding RNA in brains from patients with MS (p < 0.01) relative to non-MS patients. However, HERV env expression from blood-derived leukocytes did not differ between groups. A quantitative PCR-based assay for syncytin-1 RNA showed that median viral RNA levels were higher in brains of MS patients (5.0 log(10) copies/mu g RNA) relative to non-MS patients (4.6 log(10) copies/mu g RNA) (p < 0.05). Median syncytin-1 DNA levels in MS brains (9.8 log(10)/mu g DNA) were higher than non-MS brain tissue (7.9 log(10)/mu g DNA) (p < 0.001) without evidence of new integration events. In contrast, there were no differences in syncytin-1 RNA copy numbers between groups in both CSF (non-MS: 5.0 log(10)/ml versus MS: 3.8 log(10)/ml) and plasma (non-MS: 5.033 log(10)/ml versus MS: 2.9 log(10)/ml). These observations emphasize the selective induction of syncytin-1 in brain tissue of MS patients but also illustrate the complex dynamics of this retroelement in neuroinflammatory processes.

Previously, we reported that adenovirus-mediated gene transfer is greatly facilitated in hemizygous transgenic mice with extrasynaptic CAR expression driven by a muscle-specific promoter. However, in the present study, when these mice were bred to homozygosity, they developed a severe myopathic phenotype and died prematurely. Large numbers of necrotic and regenerating fibers were present in the skeletal muscle of the homozygous CAR transgenics. The myopathy was further characterized by increased levels of caveolin-3 and beta-dystroglycan and decreased levels of dystrophin, dysferlin, and neuronal nitric-oxide synthase. Even the hemizygotes manifested a subtle phenotype, displaying deficits in isometric force generation and perturbed mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK-erk1/2) activation during contraction. There are few naturally occurring or engineered mouse lines showing as severe a skeletal myopathy as observed with ectopic expression of CAR in the homozygotes. Taken together, these findings suggest that substantial overexpression of CAR may lead to physiological dysfunction by disturbing sarcolemmal integrity (through dystrophin deficiency), impairing sarcolemmal repair (through dysferlin deficiency), and interfering with normal signaling (through alterations in caveolin-3 and neuronal nitric-oxide synthase levels).

Small cytoplasmic domain peptides of natriuretic peptide receptor-C attenuate cell proliferation through G(i)alpha protein/MAP kinase/PI3-kinase/AKT pathways	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY-HEART AND CIRCULATORY PHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						vasoactive peptides; DNA synthesis; extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2; peptide 1; vascular smooth muscle cell	SMOOTH-MUSCLE-CELLS; PARTICULATE GUANYLATE-CYCLASE; ADENYLATE-CYCLASE; SIGNAL-TRANSDUCTION; CLEARANCE RECEPTOR; PHOSPHATIDYLINOSITOL 3-KINASE; ARGININE-VASOPRESSIN; MEDIATED INHIBITION; PORCINE BRAIN; CYCLIC-GMP	The present studies were undertaken to investigate the effect of C-atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) 4-23 and several peptide fragments containing 12 amino acids from different regions of the cytoplasmic domain of natriuretic peptide receptor (NPR)-C on cell proliferation in the absence or presence of angiotensin (ANG) II, endothelin ( ET)-1, and arginine vasopressin (AVP) in A-10 vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC). The peptide fragments used have either complete G(i) activator sequences (KH472)-H-461 ( peptide 1) and H-481-H-492 ( peptide 3) or partial Gi activator sequences R469-K480 ( peptide 2) and I-465-H-472 ( peptide Y) with truncated COOH or NH2 terminus, respectively. The other peptide used had no structural specificity (Q(473)-K-480, peptide X) or was the scrambled peptide control for peptide 1 ( peptide Z). ANG II, ET-1 and AVP significantly stimulated DNA synthesis in these cells as determined by [H-3] thymidine incorporation that was inhibited by peptides 1, 2, and 3 and not by peptides X, Y, and Z in a concentration-dependent manner, with an apparent K-i between 1 and 10 nM. In addition, C-ANP(4-23), which interacts with NPR-C, also inhibited DNA synthesis stimulated by vasoactive peptides; however, the inhibition elicited by C-ANP(4-23) was not additive with the inhibition elicited by peptide 1. On the other hand, basal DNA synthesis in these cells was not inhibited by C-ANP(4-23) or the peptide fragments. Furthermore, vasoactive peptide-induced stimulation of DNA synthesis was inhibited by PD-98059 and wortmannin, and this inhibition was potentiated by peptide 1. In addition, peptide 1 also inhibited vasoactive peptide-induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and AKT and enhanced expression of G(i)alpha proteins. These data suggest that C-ANP(4-23) and small peptide fragments containing 12 amino acids irrespective of the region of the cytoplasmic domain of NPR-C inhibit proliferative responses of vasoactive peptides through G(i)alpha protein and MAP kinase/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT pathways.

This decrease in virus production in the presence of resveratrol was not caused by direct inactivation of VZV or inhibition of virus attachment to MRC-5 cells. The drug effectively limited VZV replication if added during the first 30 h of infection. Western blot analysis and real-time RT-PCR studies demonstrated that protein and mRNA levels of IE62, an essential immediate early viral protein, were reduced when compared to controls. These results;demonstrate that VZV replication is adversely affected by resveratrol which is negatively impacting IE62 synthesis. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.

This phenomenon, known as sensitization, may confer vulnerability to drug addiction or drug-induced psychosis in humans. A similar phenomenon, referred to as endogenous sensitization, is also believed to play a role in the emergence of positive symptoms in patients with schizophrenia. Objective: To determine whether behavioral and neurochemical sensitization occur in healthy individuals after limited exposure to amphetamine in the laboratory. Design: Open-label, 1-year follow-up of repeated amphetamine administration in healthy volunteers. Setting: Department of Psychiatry, McGill University, and McConnell Brain Imaging Center, Montreal Neurological Institute. Participants: Ten healthy men (mean +/- SD age, 25.8 +/- 1.8 years). Intervention: Three single doses of amphetamine (dextroamphetamine sulfate, 0.3 mg/kg by mouth) were administered on days 1, 3, and 5. Main Outcome Measures: Using positron emission tomography and [C-11] raclopride, we measured dopamine release in response to amphetamine on the first exposure (day 1) and 14 days and 1 year after the third exposure. Results: The initial dose of amphetamine caused dopamine release in the ventral striatum (a reduction in [C-11] raclopride binding). Consistent with a sensitization-like phenomenon, 14 and 365 days after the third dose of amphetamine there was a greater psychomotor response and increased dopamine release (a greater reduction in [C-11] raclopride binding), relative to the initial dose, in the ventral striatum, progressively extending to the dorsal caudate and putamen. A high novelty-seeking personality trait and self-rating assessments indicating impulsivity predicted proneness to sensitization. Conclusions: Sensitization to stimulants can be achieved in healthy men in the laboratory. This phenomenon is associated with increased dopamine release and persists for at least 1 year.

The dopamine D4 receptor gene and moderation of the association between externalizing behavior and IQ	ARCHIVES OF GENERAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Article							DEFICIT HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; 7-REPEAT ALLELE; NOVELTY SEEKING; ANTISOCIAL-BEHAVIOR; PHYSICAL AGGRESSION; DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; PRIMATE BRAIN; DRD4 GENE; D4 GENE; ATTENTION	Background: Dopaminergic neurotransmission is implicated in externalizing behavior problems, such as aggression and hyperactivity. Externalizing behavior is known to be negatively associated with cognitive ability. Activation of dopamine D4 receptors appears to inhibit the functioning of the prefrontal cortex, a brain region implicated in cognitive ability. The 7-repeat allele of the dopamine D4 receptor gene produces less efficient receptors, relative to other alleles, and this may alter the effects of dopamine on cognitive function. Objective: To examine the influence of a polymorphism in the third exon of the dopamine D4 receptor gene on the association between externalizing behavior and IQ. Design: In 1 community sample and 2 clinical samples, the presence or absence of the 7-repeat allele was examined as a moderator of the association between externalizing behavior and IQ; the strength of this effect across samples was estimated meta-analytically. Patients: Eighty-seven boys from a longitudinal community study, 48 boys referred clinically for aggression, and 42 adult males diagnosed with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Main Outcome Measures: IQ scores and observer ratings of externalizing behavior were taken from existing data sets. Results: Among individuals lacking the 7-repeat allele, externalizing behavior was negatively correlated with IQ (mean r = -0.43; P < .001). Among individuals having at least 1 copy of the 7-repeat allele, externalizing behavior and IQ were uncorrelated (mean r = 0.02; P = .45). The difference between these correlations was significant (z = -2.99; P < .01). Conclusions: Allelic variation of the dopamine D4 receptor gene appears to be a genetic factor moderating the association between externalizing behavior and cognitive ability. This finding may help to elucidate the adaptive value of the 7-repeat allele.

Design: A concurrent validity and reliability study. Setting: Gait and posture laboratory of a rehabilitation center. Participants: Thirteen able-bodied children volunteers. Intervention: Measurements were taken on a seating simulator in quiet sitting and while reaching. The localization of the center of pressure (COP) in the anteroposterior and mediolateral directions was measured simultaneously by means of a pressure mapping system and a force platform. Main Outcome Measures: Concurrent validity was first assessed by Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients and then by Student paired t tests and Wilcoxon signed-rank test (P<.05) on the range and root mean square (RMS) amplitudes of COP. Reliability was evaluated using intraclass correlation coefficients and coefficients of variation. Results: The COP signals were significantly correlated between both instruments for the RMS and range in both tasks and directions (mean r >=.87) and for the time series while reaching (r >=.99), as well as during quiet sitting (r >= 65). Both instruments showed generally fair to good reliability in quiet sitting and excellent reliability when reaching. Conclusions: The pressure mapping system can detect the COP displacement as effectively as the force platform. In a clinical context, it could help in the evaluation of seated stability and also help in evaluating the efficacy of seating components for wheelchair users.

HER2 overexpression occurs in numerous primary human tumors and contributes to 25-30% of breast and ovarian carcinomas. Synthesis of HER2 is controlled in part by an upstream open reading frame (uORF) present in the transcript. We used synthetic capped and polyadenylated mRNAs containing sequences derived from the 5' region of the her-2 transcript fused to a firefly luciferase (LUC) reporter to examine this uORF's effect on translation in cell-free systems derived from reticulocytes, wheat germ and Neurospora crassa, and in RNA-transfected HeLa cells. The uORF reduced translation of the downstream cistron in all systems. [S-35]Met labeling of in vitro translation products obtained indicated that the uORF also affected downstream start-site selection. Primer extension inhibition (toeprint) assays of ribosomes loaded at initiation codons in reticulocyte lysates indicated that the uORF affected the interaction of ribosomes with the primary her-2 AUG codon.

Mutations within a given isoform may affect overall KCC activity. In a double-blind study, we analyzed, with Rb as a K congener, K fluxes (total flux, ouabain-sensitive Na+/K+ pump, and bumetanide-sensitive Na-K-2Cl cotransport, Cl-dependent, and ouabain- and bumetanide-insensitive KCC with or without stimulation by N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) and staurosporine or Mg removal, and basal channel-mediated fluxes, osmotic fragility, and ions and water in the RBCs of 8 controls, and of 8 patients with hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy with agenesis of corpus callosum (HMSN-ACC) with defined KCC3 mutations (813FsX813 and Phe529FsX532) involving the truncations of 338 and 619 C-terminal amino acids, respectively. Water and ion content and, with one exception, mean osmotic fragility, as well as K fluxes without stimulating agents, were similar in controls and HMSN-ACC RBCs. However, the NEM-stimulated KCC was reduced 5-fold (p < 0.0005) in HMSN-ACC vs control RBCs, as a result of a lower V-max (p < 0.05) rather than a lower Km (p = 0.109), accompanied by corresponding differences in Cl activation. Low intracellular Mg activated KCC in 6 out of 7 controls vs I out of 6 HMSN-ACC RBCs, suggesting that regulation is compromised. The lack of differences in staurosporine-activated KCC indicates different action mechanisms. Thus, in HMSN-ACC patients with KCC3 mutants, RBC KCC activity, although indistinguishable from that of the control group, responded differently to biochemical stressors, such as thiol alkylation or Mg removal, thereby indirectly indicating an important contribution of KCC3 to overall KCC function and regulation.

Methods: Fifteen people with schizophrenia and 18 controls were scanned during a pair and item memory encoding and recognition task. During encoding, subjects studied items and pairs of visual objects. In a subsequent retrieval task, participants performed an item recognition memory test (old/new decisions) and an associative recognition test (intact/rearranged decisions). The fMRI analysis of the recognition data was restricted to correct items only and a random effects model was used. Results: At the behavioral level, both groups performed equally well on item recognition, whereas people with schizophrenia demonstrated lower performance on associative recognition relative to the control group. At the brain level, the comparison between associative and item encoding revealed greater activity in the control group in the left prefrontal cortex and cingulate gyrus relative to the schizophrenia group. During recognition, greater left dorsolateral prefrontal and tight inferior prefrontal activations were observed in the control group relative to the schizophrenia group. Conclusion: This fMRI study implicates the prefrontal cortex among other brain regions as the basis for the selective associative memory encoding and recognition deficit seen in schizophrenia.

Different brain effects during chronic and acute sacral neuromodulation in urge incontinent patients with implanted neurostimulators	BJU INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						overactive bladder; micturition; sensorimotor cortex; cingulate gyrus; midbrain; orbitofrontal cortex	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; PONTINE MICTURITION CENTER; PELVIC FLOOR CONTRACTION; ELECTRICAL-STIMULATION; ULTRASTRUCTURAL EVIDENCE; BLADDER INHIBITION; NERVE; CAT; GRAY; PET	OBJECTIVE To compare changes in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF), using positron emission tomography (PET), during chronic and acute sacral neuromodulation (SN). SN is an effective long-term treatment for chronic urge incontinence due to urinary bladder hyperactivity, as sensory nerves, spinal and supraspinal structures are probably responsible for the action of SN. It is not known which brain areas are involved, and the optimum benefit of SN is not immediate, suggesting that induced plasticity of the brain is necessary. PATIENTS AND METHODS Brain activity was measured in two groups: 12 urge incontinent patients (11 women and one man; mean age 52 years) in whom an implanted unilateral S3 nerve neurostimulator had been effective for > 6 months (mean time after implantation 4.5 years); and eight urge incontinent patients (seven women and one man; mean age 49 years) in whom the neurostimulator was activated for the first time in the PET scanner. RESULTS During SN in chronically implanted patients, there were significant decreases in rCBF in the middle part of the cingulate gyrus, the ventromedial orbitofrontal cortex, midbrain and adjacent midline thalamus, and rCBF increases in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. During acute SN in newly implanted patients, there were significant decreases in rCBF the medial cerebellum, and increases in the right postcentral gyrus cortex, the right insular cortex and the ventromedial orbitofrontal cortex. Group analysis between chronic and newly implanted patients showed significant differences in the associative sensory cortex, premotor cortex and the cerebellum, all three involved in learning behaviour. CONCLUSIONS These findings suggests that chronic SN influences, presumably via the spinal cord, brain areas previously implicated in detrusor hyperactivity, awareness of bladder filling, the urge to void and the timing of micturition. Furthermore, SN affects areas involved in alertness and awareness. Acute SN modulates predominantly areas involved in sensorimotor learning, which might become less active during the course of chronic SN.

Cross-modal reorganization and speech perception in cochlear implant users	BRAIN			English	Article						visual evoked potentials; transformational apparent motion; cochlear implant; cross-modal plasticity	ACTIVATE AUDITORY-CORTEX; DEAF SIGNERS; CONGENITALLY DEAF; VISUAL-ATTENTION; NEURAL BASIS; MOTION; LANGUAGE; PLASTICITY; HEARING; ADULTS	Recent work suggests that once the auditory cortex of deaf persons has been reorganized by cross-modal plasticity, it can no longer respond to signals from a cochlear implant (CI) installed subsequently. To further examine this issue, we compared the evoked potentials involved in the processing of visual stimuli between CI users and hearing controls. The stimuli were concentric circles replaced by a different overlapping shape, inducing a shape transformation, known to activate the ventral visual pathway in human adults. All CI users had their device implanted for > 1 year, but obtained different levels of auditory performance following training to establish language comprehension. Seven of the 13 patients showed good capacities for speech recognition with the CI (good performers) while the six others demonstrated poor speech recognition abilities (poor performers). The evoked potentials of all patients showed larger amplitudes, with different distributions of scalp activations between the two groups. The poor performers exhibited broader, anteriorly distributed, high P2 amplitudes over the cortex whereas the good performers showed significantly higher P2 amplitudes over visual occipital areas. These results suggest the existence of a profound cross-modal reorganization in the poor performers and an intramodal reorganization in the good performers. We interpret these data on the basis of enhanced audiovisual coupling as the key to a long-term functional improvement in speech discrimination in CI users.

Methods and procedures: Results of language tests carried out during the patients' stay in an acute tertiary trauma centre were obtained. These tests measured performance in the areas of confrontation naming, auditory comprehension, semantic and letter category naming and comprehension of verbal absurdities. Data for the predictive variables were gathered by retrospective chart review. Stepwise multiple linear regressions were carried out on the predictive variables. Main outcomes and results: Education and TBI severity as measured with the GCS score were the most significant factors predicting language deficits in the acute care setting. Conclusions: These findings will serve to guide health care professionals in predicting prognosis for cognitive-communication deficits post-TBI and in planning for appropriate resources in speech-language pathology to meet these patients' needs.

The recent use of Axis-II personality disorders, notably borderline personality disorder (BPD), has appeared in the TBI literature as an alternative to OPD. This would presumably offer a better description and understanding of the multiple clinical manifestations of these personality changes and disorders. This article offers a view that it is possible and fruitful to use both diagnoses in a complementary manner. An accurate recognition of the respective phenomenologies of both BPD and OPD is a key factor in achieving a differential diagnosis, including, if required, a dual diagnosis. The phenomenology of both conditions in reference to DSM-IV criteria is compared and illustrated through two clinical vignettes.

Recent reports indicate that such transporters are present not only in the liver, intestine, or blood-brain barrier but also in the heart. The objective of our study was to determine whether treatment of animals with verapamil, a well-known L-type calcium channel blocker with modulatory properties of membrane transporters, would alter distribution and cardiac electrophysiological effects of an I-Kr blocker. Male guinea pigs (n=72) were treated with either saline or verapamil at various doses (1.5 to 15 mg/kg) and for various durations (I to 7 d). Animals were sacrified 24 h after the last dose of verapamil (or saline), and their hearts were isolated and retroperfused with cisapride, a gastrokinetic drug with I-Kr, blockade properties. In hearts obtained from animals treated with vehicle, 50 nmol/L cisapride prolonged MAPD(90) by 15 +/- 5 ms vs. 36 8 ms in hearts from animals treated with verapamil 15 mg(.)kg(-1).d(-1) for 5 d (p < 0.01). Treatment effects were dose- and time-dependent. Cardiac myocytes isolated from animals treated with vehicle or verapamil were incubated for 3 h with 100 ng/mL cisapride. Intracellular concentrations of cisapride in cardiac myocytes from animals treated with verapamil were 1.6-fold higher than those measured in myocytes from animals treated with vehicle (p < 0.01). The increase in intracellular concentrations of cisapride and potentiation of cisapride electrophysiological effects suggest that chronic treatment with drugs such as verapamil may modulate drug effects on the QT interval because of an increased access to intracellular binding sites on I-Kr, channels.

An equal number of sex and age matched population based controls were recruited from family allowance or provincial health insurance files. Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate the risk of developing childhood brain tumors associated with self-reported exposure to infection. Results Childhood brain tumor risk was weakly to moderately elevated after maternal reported exposure to several indicators of infection: use of antibiotics during gestation (OR = 1.7, 95% CI = 0.8-3.6) or childhood (OR = 1.4, 95% CI = 0.7-2.9), removal of tonsils, adenoids or appendix (OR = 1.2, 95% CI = 0.6-2.4), having siblings (OR = 1.4, 95% CI = 0.9-2.3), and being at least second born (OR = 1.7, 95% CI = 1.2-2.4). Moreover, childhood brain tumor risk was reduced for some subjects who were breastfed or attended daycare for more than 1 year. Risk varied by sex, age at diagnosis and tumor type. Conclusion Childhood brain tumor risk may be associated with exposure to infective agents.

Intracellular peptides of natriuretic peptide receptor-C inhibit vascular hypertrophy via Gq alpha/MAP kinase signaling pathways	CARDIOVASCULAR RESEARCH			English	Article						NPR-C; peptide-1; vasoactive peptides; protein synthesis; ERK 1/2; Gq alpha; VSMC	SMOOTH-MUSCLE-CELLS; ADENYLATE-CYCLASE ACTIVITY; CARDIAC-HYPERTROPHY; CYCLIC-GMP; MEDIATED INHIBITION; CYTOPLASMIC DOMAIN; PORCINE BRAIN; ATRIAL; PROTEIN; HYPERTENSION	Objective: The present studies were undertaken to investigate if the activation of natriuretic peptide receptor-C (NPR-C) that has been shown to inhibit cell proliferation could also modulate the hypertrophic responses of vasoactive peptides in A 10 vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC). Methods: For these studies A10 VSMC were incubated in the presence of angiotensin 11 (AngII), endothelin (ET-1) or arginine vasopressin (AVP) alone or in combination with C-ANP(4-23) Or NPR-C peptides for 24 h and were used for Western blotting and [H-3]leucine incorporation. The different peptide fragments used were (KKYRITIERRNH472)-K-461 (peptide-1) and (HRELREDSIRSH492)-R-481 (peptide-3) with complete Gi activator sequences and R(469)RNHQEESNIGK(480) (peptide-2) and (ITIERRNH472)-T-465 (peptideY) with partial Gi activator sequences. The other peptide used had no structural specificity, (Q(473)EESNIGK(480); peptide X) or was the scrambled peptide control for peptide-1 (ITIYKKRRNHR-E; peptide Z). Results: AngII, ET-I and AVP significantly stimulated protein synthesis in these cells as determined by 3 H-leucine incorporation, which was inhibited by peptides 1, 2 and 3 and not by peptides X, Y or Z in a concentration-dependent manner with an apparent Ki between 1-10 nM. In addition, C-ANP4-23 also inhibited protein synthesis stimulated by AngII, ET-I and AVP; whereas basal protein synthesis in these cells was not inhibited by C-ANP4-23 or by the peptide fragments. Furthermore, AngII-, AVP- and ET-1-induced stimulation of protein synthesis was inhibited by PD98059 (MEK inhibitor) and wortmannin (PI3K inhibitor) and this inhibition was potentiated by peptide-1. In addition, peptide-1 was also able to inhibit vasoactive peptide-induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and AKT and enhanced the expression of Gq alpha protein in these cells. Conclusions: These data suggest that C-ANP4-23 and small peptide fragments containing 12 amino acids from different regions of cytoplasmic domain of NPR-C could modulate vasoactive peptide-stimulated protein synthesis through Gq alpha/MAP kinase/PI3K and AKT pathways.

It acts via both ionotropic GABA-A and metabotropic GABA-B receptors. We evaluated the interaction of receptors with members of the inwardly rectifying potassium (Kir 3) channel family, which also play an important role in neuronal transmission and membrane excitability. These channels are functionally regulated by GABA-B receptors. Possible physical interactions between GABA-B receptor and Kir 3 channels expressed in HEK cells were evaluated using Bioluminescence Resonance Energy Transfer (BRET) experiments, co-immunoprecipitation and confocal microscopy. Our data indicate that Kir 3 channels and G beta gamma subunits can interact with the GABA-B-1 subunits independently of the GABA-B-2 subunit or Kir 3.4 which are ultimately responsible for their targetting to the cell surface. Thus signalling complexes containing GABA-B receptors, G proteins and Kir channels are formed shortly after biosynthesis most likely in the endoplasmic reticulum. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Moreover, a growing body of evidence now suggests that humans are using base rate information. Unsupervised connectionist networks are used in computer science for machine learning and in psychology to model human cognition, but it is unclear whether they are sensitive to prior odds. In this paper, we show that hard competitive learners are unable to use environmental biases while recurrent associative memories use frequency of exemplars and categories independently. Hence, it is concluded that recurrent associative memories are more useful than hard competitive networks to model human cognition and have a higher potential in machine learning.

We used a dataset of 108,931 daily milk yields (dataset A) collected from three lactations of dairy cows managed in a production farm. Using the actual data on daily milk yields and the data recorded on official milk recording test days, a number of neural networks were designed and parameters of Wood's model were estimated. The quality of each network and regression model was measured using coefficients of determination, relative approximation errors (RAE), and root mean square errors (RMS). In order to test the prognostic parameters of the models, we randomly selected a subset of cows from the studied population, which produced in a dataset of 28,576 daily yields (dataset B). For those cows, daily and lactation yield forecasts were generated, which were next compared with their actual (observed) yield records and with the yields calculated by SYMLEK (ZETO Olsztyn Sp. z o.o., www.zeto.olsztyn.pl). The results have shown that the quality parameters of the designed neural networks were better than those of the regression model, for both the daily yields and test-day data (higher coefficients of determination and lower RAE and RMS). The prognostic parameters estimated for the forecasts of the neural networks were characterised by lower errors of prediction for both the daily yields and test-day data and exhibited higher coefficients of correlation between the predicted and the actual data (or the yields produced by SYMLEK). The predictions by the neural networks were more accurate than those by Wood's models. Furthermore, the predictions by both analysed models were closer to reality than the values estimated with the SYMLEK system. Application of neural networks does not require the data meeting the assumptions that must otherwise be met in a regression model. Large datasets are not needed to design a quite reliable neural network and, what is more, it is much easier to work with such a model than with a regression model. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The impact of prematurity on cerebellar growth and development is then examined. The important insights provided by recent neuroimaging I and genetic advances are reviewed. Recent findings Previous areas of dispute are being addressed by advances in two major areas. Advanced neuroimaging studies during fetal and postnatal life are now providing important insights into the nature of normal and abnormal development of the brainstem and cerebellum. These powerful new techniques for defining morphology in vivo, together with major advances in genetics, are accelerating our understanding of genotype-phenotype relationships. Conversely, the ability to link early brain injury to subsequent cerebellar development has challenged previous understanding of the distinction between acquired and primary dysgenesis, presumed to be genetic in origin. Summary The synthesis of a rational and clinically useful classification of posterior fossa malformations has been elusive. Recent developments promise to resolve ongoing disputes that have delayed progress. However, these insights into disturbed structural development demand rigorous examination of their long-term functional significance and caution before their prognostic significance is applied clinically.

The anatomical, cellular, and subcellular localization of these transporters has been described in detail. It has been shown that, as in peripheral tissues, these transporters are localized both in an intracellular pool and at the plasma membrane is is coherent with a translocation phenomenon, but e data reporting the effect of insulin on that property of GLUT4 and GLUT8 remains very controversial. Glucose and insulin have been shown to modulate GLUT4 expression. Based on their anatomical features, different hypotheses have been proposed. Because of the colocalization with the insulin receptors, insulin might regulate glucose uptake in specific brain areas. A role in nutrient sensing has also been proposed, since both insulin and GLUT4 are expressed in gluco-excited neurons of the hypothalamus. Some studies suggest a role for GLUT8 in the endoplasmic reticulum stress. Whereas much has been learned about their cellular features in the central nervous system, many questions remain unanswered concerning their physiological functions. Gene knockout strategy specifically in the brain and even more in specific nuclei or type of cells should provide new clues to the physiological role of both transporters in the central nervous system.

The UBL domain of PLIC-1 regulates aggresome formation	EMBO REPORTS			English	Article						PLIC-1; EPS15; aggresomes	UBIQUITIN-INTERACTING MOTIF; PROTEASOME; PROTEINS; FAMILY; DEGRADATION; ENDOCYTOSIS; COMPONENTS; RECEPTOR; DISEASE; CELL	Defects in protein folding and the proteasomal pathway have been linked with many neurodegenerative diseases. PLIC-1 (protein linking IAP to the cytoskeleton) is a ubiquitin-like protein that binds to the ubiquitin-interacting motif (UIM) of the proteasomal subunit S5a. Here, we show that PLIC-1 also binds to the UIM proteins ataxin 3-a deubiquitinating enzyme HSJ1a-a co-chaperone-and EPS15 (epidermal growth factor substrate 15)-an endocytic protein. Using a polyglutamine (polyQ) disease model, we found that both endogenous PLIC-1 and EPS15 localize to perinuclear aggresomes, and that polyQ enhances their in vivo interaction. We show that knockdown of PLIC-1 and EPS15 by RNA interference reduces aggresome formation. In addition, PLIC-1(Delta UBL) functions as a dominant-negative mutant, blocking both polyQ transport to aggresomes and the association of EPS15 with dispersed aggregates. We also show that PLIC-1 is upregulated by arsenite-induced protein misfolding. These results indicate a role for PLIC-1 in the protein aggregation-stress pathway, and we propose a novel function for the ubiquitin-like (UBL) domain-by means of UBL-UIM interactions-in transport to aggresomes.

Earlier studies have provided evidence suggestive of adverse liver effects in adult Coturnix spp. exposed to CL-20, yet analysis of tissue samples (plasma, liver, brain, heart, or spleen) indicated that CL-20 was not detectable in these treated animals. The present study was conducted to identify and purify the enzymes capable of CL-20 biotransformation. Results indicate that the hepatic biotransformation of CL-20 in vitro was inhibited by ethacrynic acid (93%) and by the glutathione (GSH) analogue S-octylglutathione (80%), suggesting the involvement of glutathione-S-transferase (GST). Partially purified cytosolic alpha- and mu-type GST (requiring presence of GSH as a cofactor) from quail and rabbit liver was capable of CL-20 biotransformation. The degradation of CL-20 (0.30 +/- 0.05 and 0.40 +/- 0.02 nmol/min/mg protein for quail and rabbit, respectively) was accompanied with the formation of nitrite and consumption of GSH. Using liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry, we detected two intermediates, that is, open-ring, monodenitrated GSH-conjugated CL-20 biotransformation product with the same deprotonated molecular mass ion at 699 Da, suggesting isomeric forms of the intermediate metabolites. Identity of the conjugated metabolites was confirmed by using ring-labeled [N-15]CL-20 and the nitro group-labeled [(NO2)-N-15]CL-20. These data suggest that the in vitro biotransformation of CL-20 by GST under the conditions tested may be a key initial step in the in vivo degradation of CL-20 in the quail and resulted in the formation of more biologically reactive intermediates than the parent compound. These data will aid in our understanding of the biotransformation processes of CL-20 in vivo.

Most are limited by inclusion of lesional and nonlesional patients. Goal: To define the epileptic and functional outcome of children with nonlesional FLE. Methods: We reviewed medical records and neuropsychological evaluations of patients with nonlesional FLE diagnosed between 1994 and 2004. We included children with either focal or regional frontal EEG and/or functional imaging abnormalities. We reviewed their charts for seizure and neuropsychological outcome. Results: We included 21 children. Twelve (57.1%) presented with daily seizures. Seizures were nocturnal in 8 of 21, secondarily generalized in 6 of 21, adversive in 5 of 21, and focal motor in 6 of 21. Although, initial seizure control was poor in 14 of 21, long-term control was achieved in 10 of 21 after 14.6 +/- 22.3 months. Early development was normal in 12 of 21 but at later formal neuropsychological evaluation only 3 of 12 still had a normal profile. The majority of children had learning difficulties requiring special education prior to seizure onset (6 of 10). A clearly defined regression after seizure onset was observed in three children. The majority exhibited attention deficit and hyperactivity or impulsivity (14 of 21), behavioral problems (8 of 21), and cognitive impairments (10 of 21). Early seizure control was associated with a better cognitive outcome. Conclusion: Nonlesional FLE is associated with poor seizure and behavioral outcomes. Whether this is secondary to MRI-silent developmental lesions or to the progressive repercussion of seizures on frontal lobe functions remains uncertain. A prospective study with early neuropsychological assessment could help confirm the latter.

We have previously shown that prion protein is a potent inhibitor of Bax-induced apoptosis in human primary neurons and in the breast carcinoma MCF-7 cells. Here, we used the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to investigate if the neuroprotective function of prion protein requires other members of the Bcl-2 family given that S. cerevisiae lacks Bcl-2 genes but undergoes a mitochondrial-dependent apoptotic cell death upon exogenous expression of Bax protein. We show that Bax induces cell death and growth inhibition in S. cerevisiae. Prion protein prevents Bax-mediated cell death. Prion protein overcomes Bax-mediated growth arrest in S phase but cannot overcome population growth inhibition because the cells then accumulate in G(2)/M phase. We conclude that prion protein does not require other Bcl-2 family proteins to protect against Bax-mediated cell death.

Immunohistochemical localization of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) in the gonad and digestive gland of Mya arenaria (Mollusca : Bivalvia)	GENERAL AND COMPARATIVE ENDOCRINOLOGY			English	Article						serotonin; 5-hydroxytryptamine; marine bivalves; Mya arenaria; gametogenesis; gonad; digestive gland; immunohistochemistry; Prosorhynchus squamatus	MUSSEL MYTILUS-EDULIS; SCALLOP PATINOPECTEN-YESSOENSIS; INDUCED MEIOSIS REINITIATION; NERVOUS-SYSTEM; PROSORHYNCHUS-SQUAMATUS; RUDITAPES-PHILIPPINARUM; DREISSENA-POLYMORPHA; ZEBRA MUSSEL; SURF CLAM; OOCYTES	Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine or 5-HT) C10H12N2O plays a central role in several physiological processes in marine molluscs, especially in reproduction. 5-HT acts as a neurohormone to modulate spawning, parturition and meiosis by reinitiating prophase in arrested oocytes. Preliminary experiments using 10(-5) M 5-HT dissolved in aquarium water showed that 5-HT induced spawning movements in ripe clams and in both sexes of Mya arenaria while only a few males released sperm. The occurrence of serotoninergic fibers was demonstrated by PAP immunohistochemical reaction in the gonad of both sexes during gametogenesis. In an organism infected by the trematode parasite Prosorhynchus squamatus, we showed that serotoninergic innervation completely disappeared around the gonad's follicles. Although the gonad and digestive gland are intertwined, no serotoninergic innervations were found in the digestive gland. These findings suggest, for the first time to our knowledge in the soft shell clam, that serotonin might be involved in the regulation of gametogenesis. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Parallel changes in metabolite and expression profiles in crooked-tail mutant and folate-reduced wild-type mice	HUMAN MOLECULAR GENETICS			English	Article							NEURAL-TUBE DEFECTS; SKI PROTOONCOGENE; DIETARY-FOLATE; DEFICIENT MICE; FOLINIC ACID; MOUSE; SUPPLEMENTATION; NEURULATION; METHIONINE; LACKING	Anomalies in homocysteine (HCY) and folate metabolism are associated with common birth defects and adult diseases, several of which can be suppressed with dietary folate supplementation. Although supplementation reduces the occurrence and severity of neural tube defects (NTDs), many cases are resistant to these beneficial effects. The basis for variable response and biomarkers that predict responsiveness are unknown. Crooked-tail (Cd) mutant mice are an important model of folate-responsive NTDs. To identify features that are diagnostic for responsiveness versus resistance to dietary folate supplementation, we surveyed metabolite and expression levels in liver samples from folate-supplemented, folate-reduced and control diets in Cd mutant and wild-type adult females. Cd homozygotes had normal total homocysteine (tHcy) levels suggesting that folate suppresses NTDs through a mechanism that does not involve modulating serum tHcy levels. Instead, parallel changes in metabolite and expression profiles in folate-supplemented Cd/Cd homozygotes and folate-reduced +/+ and Cd/+ mice suggest that Crooked-tail homozygotes have a defect in the utilization of intracellular folate. Then, by combining these expression and metabolite profile results with published results for other models and their controls, two clusters were found, one of which included several folate-responsive NTD models and the other previously untested and presumably folate-resistant models. The predictive value of these profiles was verified by demonstrating that NTDs of Ski-/- mutant mice, whose profile suggested resistance to folate supplementation, were not suppressed with dietary folate supplementation. These results raise the possibility of using metabolite and expression profiles to distinguish folate-responsive and resistance adult females who are at risk for bearing fetuses with an NTD.

To begin to understand the biological function of LGI1, we have determined its pattern of glycosylation, subcellular expression and capacity for secretion. LGI1 is expressed as two different isoforms in the brain, and we show that the long isoform is a secreted protein, whereas the short isoform is retained in an intracellular pool. ADLTE-related mutants of the long form are defective for secretion and are retained in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi complex. Finally, we show that normal secreted LGI1 specifically binds to the cell surface of differentiated PC12 cells. We propose that LGI1 is a secreted factor important for neuronal development and that ADTLE is a disease that results from the loss of regulation in the protein available either extracellular or intracellularly.

This paper describes the application of an artificial neural network to design effort estimation. Using historical data from General Electric (GE) Hydro, a General Regression Neural Network (GRNN) model is constructed to learn the relationship between four major factors, namely, product complexity, technical difficulty to team expertise ratio, type of drawings submitted to the customer, and involvement of design partners as inputs, and effort needed to execute designs for hydroelectric generators as an output. The performance of the model was evaluated in terms of a number of well known objective criteria. The results indicate that artificial neural networks can be considered as a promising tool for improving the estimation accuracy of design effort, and consequently minimizing the probability of schedule and cost overruns. Significance: Delivery of products as scheduled and within budget is one aspect of measuring the success of a project. This paper presents a methodology that provides greatly improved design effort estimates. This is of interest to industry since improving design effort estimation accuracy is a major factor in minimizing the severity of cost overrun and schedule slippage.

Systemic hyperoxia, hypercapnia, and hypoxia are known to alter retinal perfusion. The effects such experimentally induced systemic blood gas perturbations have on inner neuroretinal function in humans were examined. METHODS. Twenty healthy adults participated in each of three test sessions. The effects of breathing pure oxygen (O-2), carbogen, or a hypoxic gas on the pattern electroretinogram (pERG) were investigated. The stimulus consisted of high-contrast, black-and-white, 48-min arc checks reversing at 1 Hz. pERGs were recorded with a Dawson-Trick-Litzkow electrode at the end of 5 minutes of breathing room air, 5 minutes of breathing the test gas, immediately after the flow of gas was stopped, and 10 minutes after the flow of gas was stopped. RESULTS. Amplitudes and implicit times of the major positive (P50) and negative (N95) components of the pERG were not altered during the pure O-2 and carbogen breathing sessions. Although the amplitude and implicit time of P50 were not modified significantly with systemic hypoxia, they were depressed and delayed, respectively, for N95. CONCLUSIONS. Inner neuroretinal function remained unchanged during increased blood O-2 and carbon dioxide levels known to alter retinal blood flow, but it was altered during decreased blood O-2 levels. Overall, these results indicate that the generators of P50 are resistant to systemic hyperoxia, hypercapnia/hyperoxia, and hypoxia. They further indicate that the generators of N95, namely the retinal ganglion cells, are particularly sensitive to transient, mild systemic hypoxia.

Our study explores the representation in auditory sensory memory of three timbre dimensions (acoustically related to attack time, spectral centroid, and spectrum fine structure), using the mismatch negativity (MMN) component of the auditory event-related potential. MMN is elicited by a discriminable change in a sound sequence and reflects the detection of the discrepancy between the current stimulus and traces in auditory sensory memory. The stimuli used in the present study were carefully controlled synthetic tones. MMNs were recorded after changes along each of the three timbre dimensions and their combinations. Additivity of unidimensional MMNs and dipole modeling results suggest partially separate MMN generators for different timbre dimensions, reflecting their mainly separate processing in auditory sensory memory. The results expand to timbre dimensions a property of separation of the representation in sensory memory that has already been reported between basic perceptual attributes (pitch, loudness, duration, and location) of sound sources.

Given that basal forebrain (BF) neurons project to the hypothalamus and play important diverse roles in sleep/wake states, we sought to determine whether acetylcholine (ACh), glutamate (Glu), and/or GABA-releasing BF neurons innervate and could thereby differentially regulate the Orx neurons. From discrete injections of biotinylated dextran amine (BDA, 10,000 MW) into the magnocellular preoptic nucleus (MCPO) and substantia innominata (SI) in the rat, BDA-labeled fibers projected to the lateral hypothalamus (LH), perifornical area (PF), and dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMH), where similar to 41%, similar to 11%, and 9% of Orx-positive (+) neurons were respectively contacted in each region. Employing triple fluorescent staining for Orx, BDA, and presynaptic vesicular (V) transporters (T), we found that only 4% of the innervated Orx+ neurons in the LH were contacted by BDA+[VAChT+] terminals, whereas similar to 31% and similar to 67% were respectively contacted by BDA+[VGluT2+] and BDA+[VGAT+] terminals. In 3D-rendered and rotated confocal images, we confirmed the latter contacts and examined staining for postsynaptic proteins PSD-95, a marker for glutamatergic synapses, and gephyrin, a marker for GABAergic synapses, that were located on Orx+ neurons facing BDA-labeled terminals in similar to 20% and similar to 50% of contacts, respectively. With such synaptic input, BF glutamatergic neurons can excite Orx neurons and thus act to maintain behavioral arousal with muscle tone, whereas GABAergic neurons can inhibit Orx neurons and thus promote behavioral quiescence and sleep along with muscle atonia.

Recombinant Solanum chacoense cytosolic NDPK incubated with [gamma-P-32]ATP was allowed to autophosphorylate and P-32-labelled P-Ser was identified in an acid hydrolysate of the protein by two-dimensional TLC. Further analysis of P-32-labelled recombinant NDPK by tryptic digestion followed by automated Edman sequencing of the radioactive peptide allowed the identification of a single and conserved P-Ser residue at position 117. Analysis of site-directed mutants where Ser117 was substituted to Asp indicated that the presence of a negative charge at position 117 dramatically lowered the enzyme's catalytic efficiency. Ser autophosphorylation was markedly reduced with increasing ADP concentrations in the autophosphorylation assay. These findings provide evidence that autophosphorylation of cytosolic NDPK on Ser117 could constitute a regulatory mechanism for this important enzyme and that autophosphorylation of Ser117 is modulated by NDP availability.

Dual regulation of translation initiation and peptide chain elongation during BDNF-induced LTP in vivo: evidence for compartment-specific translation control	JOURNAL OF NEUROCHEMISTRY			English	Article						dentate gyrus; hippocampus; neurotrophic factors; synaptic plasticity; translation control	LONG-TERM POTENTIATION; LOCAL PROTEIN-SYNTHESIS; CAMKII MESSENGER-RNA; SYNAPTIC PLASTICITY; NEUROTROPHIC FACTOR; MAMMALIAN TARGET; DENTATE GYRUS; DEPENDENT TRANSLATION; MEMORY CONSOLIDATION; HIPPOCAMPAL-NEURONS	Protein synthesis underlying activity-dependent synaptic plasticity is controlled at the level of mRNA translation. We examined the dynamics and spatial regulation of two key translation factors, eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) and elongation factor-2 (eEF2), during long-term potentiation (LTP) induced by local infusion of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) into the dentate gyrus of anesthetized rats. BDNF-induced LTP led to rapid, transient phosphorylation of eIF4E and eEF2, and enhanced expression of eIF4E protein in dentate gyrus homogenates. Infusion of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) inhibitor U0126 blocked BDNF-LTP and modulation of the translation factor activity and expression. Quantitative immunohistochemical analysis revealed enhanced staining of phospho-eIF4E and total eIF4E in dentate granule cells. The in vitro synaptodendrosome preparation was used to isolate the synaptic effects of BDNF in the dentate gyrus. BDNF treatment of synaptodendrosomes elicited rapid, transient phosphorylation of eIF4E paralleled by enhanced expression of alpha-calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II. In contrast, BDNF had no effect on eEF2 phosphorylation state in synaptodendrosomes. The results demonstrate rapid ERK-dependent regulation of the initiation and elongation steps of protein synthesis during BDNF-LTP in vivo. Furthermore, the results suggest a compartment-specific regulation in which initiation is selectively enhanced by BDNF at synapses, while both initiation and elongation are modulated at non-synaptic sites.

Andrew			Dopamine has bidirectional effects on synaptic responses to cortical inputs in layer II of the lateral entorhinal cortex	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article							RAT PREFRONTAL CORTEX; LONG-TERM POTENTIATION; D1/D5 RECEPTOR ACTIVATION; NEURONS IN-VITRO; HIPPOCAMPAL-FORMATION; PYRAMIDAL NEURONS; IMMUNOHISTOCHEMICAL LOCALIZATION; SUSTAINED ENHANCEMENT; MEMBRANE-PROPERTIES; PIRIFORM CORTEX	Dopaminergic modulation of neuronal function has been extensively studied in the prefrontal cortex, but much less is known about its effects on glutamate-mediated synaptic transmission in the entorhinal cortex. The mesocortical dopamine system innervates the superficial layers of the lateral entorhinal cortex and may therefore modulate sensory inputs to this area. In awake rats, systemic administration of the dopamine reuptake inhibitor GBR12909 (10 mg/kg, ip) enhanced extracellular dopamine levels in the entorhinal cortex and significantly facilitated field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) in layer II evoked by piriform cortex stimulation. An analysis of the receptor subtypes involved in the facilitation of evoked fEPSPs was conducted using horizontal slices of lateral entorhinal cortex in vitro. The effects of 15-min bath application of dopamine on synaptic responses were bidirectional and concentration dependent. Synaptic responses were enhanced by 10 mu M dopamine and suppressed by concentrations of 50 and 100 mu M. The D-1-receptor antagonist SCH23390 (50 mu M) blocked the significant facilitation of synaptic responses induced by 10 mu M dopamine and the D-2-receptor antagonist sulpiride (50 mu M) prevented the suppression of fEPSPs observed with higher concentrations of dopamine. We propose here that dopamine release in the lateral entorhinal cortex, acting through D-1 receptors, can lead to an enhancement of the salience of sensory representations carried to this region from adjacent sensory cortices.

To this end, we recorded BLA neurons in isoflurane-anesthetized animals with tungsten microelectrodes. Projection cells were identified by antidromic activation from cortical projection sites of the BLA. Although most projection cells fired spontaneously at low rates (< 1 Hz), an important subset fired at higher rates (up to 6.8 Hz). In fact, the distribution of firing rates in projection cells and unidentified BLA neurons overlapped extensively, even though the latter cell group presumably contains a higher proportion of interneurons. The only difference between the two distributions was a small subset (5.1%) of unidentified neurons with unusually high firing rates (9-16 Hz). Similarly, distributions of spike durations in both cell groups were indistinguishable, although most of the fast-firing neurons had spike durations at the low end of the distribution. However, we observed that spike durations depended on the exact position of the electrode with respect to the recorded cell, varying by as much as 0.7 ms. Thus neither firing rate nor spike waveform allowed for unequivocal separation of projection cells from interneurons. Nevertheless, we propose the use of two firing rate cutoffs to obtain relatively pure samples of projection cells and interneurons: <= 1 Hz for projection cells and >= 7 Hz for fast- spiking interneurons. Supplemented with spike-duration cutoffs of >= 0.7 ms for projection cells and <= 0.5 ms for interneurons, this approach should keep instances of misclassifications to a minimum.

Positioned to inhibit: Netrin-1 and netrin receptor expression after spinal cord injury	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE RESEARCH			English	Article						UNC-5; UNC5; DCC; regeneration; myelin; inhibitory	CHONDROITIN-SULFATE PROTEOGLYCAN; NOGO MESSENGER-RNA; AXONAL REGENERATION; NERVOUS-SYSTEM; GLIAL SCAR; ADULT-RAT; DCC; PROTEIN; UNC-5; GROWTH	Netrin-1 regulates axon extension during embryonic development and is expressed by neurons and myelinating oligodendrocytes in the adult CNS. To investigate the potential role of netrin-1 after spinal cord injury, we examined the expression of netrin-1 and netrin receptors after sagittal myelotomy in adult rats. This lesion targets spinal commissural projections, which respond to netrin-1 during development. Netrin-1 mRNA and protein levels were dramatically reduced at the site of injury and reduced expression persisted for at least 7 months. Neither netrin-1 protein nor mRNA was associated with the glial scar, but netrin-1 was expressed by neurons and oligodendrocytes immediately adjacent to the lesion. The post-injury distribution detected is similar to that reported for myelin-associated inhibitors of axon regeneration, such as Nogo, and is distinct from the distribution of inhibitors associated with a glial scar. DCC and UNC-5 homologue (UNC5H) expression also was reduced after injury. Although UNC5H levels recovered, DCC expression at the site of injury remained similar to 50% of pre-injury values at 7 months. Increased UNC5H immunoreactivity was associated with fibers in the superficial layers of the dorsal horn and in fibers located in white matter adjacent to the lesion. The dominant expression of UNC5H on axons and neurons in the spinal cord after injury and the persistent expression of netrin-1 by oligodendrocytes surrounding the lesion are consistent with the hypothesis that netrin-1 is a myelin-associated inhibitor of axonal regeneration after spinal cord injury.

Essential function of PTP-PEST during mouse embryonic vascularization, mesenchyme formation, neurogenesis and early liver development	MECHANISMS OF DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						PTP-PEST; tyrosine phosphatase; integrin; mouse; knockout; embryonic stem cell; vascularization; neurogenesis; mesenchyme; liver	PROTEIN-TYROSINE-PHOSPHATASE; DEFINITIVE ENDODERM; MESODERMAL DEFECTS; FOCAL ADHESIONS; SH3 DOMAIN; ASSOCIATION; KINASE; DEPHOSPHORYLATION; EXPRESSION; SUBSTRATE	PTP (protein -tyrosine phosphatase)-PEST is a ubiquitously expressed cellular regulator of integrin signalling. It has been shown to bind several molecules such as She, paxillin and Grb2, that are involved downstream of FAK (focal adhesion kinase) pathway. Through its specific association to p130cas and further dephosphorylation, PTP-PEST plays a critical role in cell-matrix interactions, which are essential during embryogenesis. We report here that ablation of the gene leads to early embryonic lethality, correlating well with the high expression of the protein during embryonic development. We observed an increased level of tyrosine phosphorylation of p130cas protein in E9.5 PTP-PEST-/- embryos, a first evidence of biochemical defect leading to abnormal growth and development. Analysis of null mutant embryos revealed that they reach gastrulation, initiate yolk sac formation, but fail to progress through normal subsequent developmental events. E9.5-10.5 PTP-PEST-/- embryos had morphological abnormalities such as defective embryo turning, improper somitogenesis and vasculogenesis, impaired liver development, accompanied by degeneration in both neuroepithelium and somatic epithelia. Moreover, in embryos surviving until E10.5, the caudal region was truncated, with severe mesenchyme deficiency and no successful liver formation. Defects in embryonic mesenchyme as well as subsequent failure of proper vascularization, liver development and somatogenesis, seemed likely to induce lethality at this stage of development, and these results confirm that PTP-PEST plays an essential function in early embryogenesis.

The effects of a 0.4-mm-thick titanium mesh on the dose profile at 3 regions within a solid water phantom were measured using extended dose range-2 (EDR2) film for 6- and 18-MV photon beams. All measurements were performed with the titanium mesh placed at a depth of 1.5 cm in the phantom. Films were exposed immediately above the mesh, immediately below the mesh, and at a depth of 5 cm from the surface of the phantom. The films were scanned using a scanning densitometer. In the region directly above the titanium mesh, there was an increase in dose of 7.1% for 6-MV photons and 4.9% for 18-MV photons. Directly below the titanium mesh, there was an average decrease in dose of 1.5% for 6-MV photons and an increase of 1.0% for 18-MV photons. At 5-cm depth, for 6- and 18-MV photons, there was a decrease in dose of 2.2% and 0.6%, respectively. We concluded that for cranial irradiation with high-energy photons, the dosimetric impact of a 0.4-mm titanium mesh is small and does not require modification in treatment parameters.

APPL1 associates with TrkA and GIPC1 and is required for nerve growth factor-mediated signal transduction	MOLECULAR AND CELLULAR BIOLOGY			English	Article							RECEPTOR TYROSINE KINASE; SYMPATHETIC NEURONS; NEUROTROPHIN RECEPTORS; RETROGRADE TRANSPORT; ENDOSOME HYPOTHESIS; BINDING-PROTEIN; NGF; SURVIVAL; VESICLES; COMPLEX	The neurotrophin receptor TrkA plays critical roles in the nervous system by recruiting signaling molecules that activate pathways required for the growth and survival of neurons. Here, we report APPL1 as a TrkA-associated protein. APPL1 and TrkA coirnmunoprecipitated in sympathetic neurons. We have identified two routes through which this association can occur. APPL1 was isolated as a binding partner for the TrkA-interacting protein GIPC1 from rat brain lysate by mass spectrometry. The PDZ domain of GIPC1 directly engaged the C-terminal sequence of APPL1. This interaction provides a means through which APPL1 may be recruited to TrkA. In addition, the APPL1 PTB domain bound to TrkA, indicating that APPL1 may associate with TrkA independently of GIPC1. Isolation of endosomal fractions by high-resolution centrifugation determined that APPL1, GIPC1, and phosphorylated TrkA are enriched in the same fractions. Reduction of APPL1 or GIPC1 protein levels suppressed nerve growth factor (NGF)-dependent MEK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase, and AM activation and neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells. Together, these results indicate that GIPC1 and APPL1 play a role in TrkA function and suggest that a population of endosomes bearing a complex of APPL1, GIPC1, and activated TrkA may transmit NGF signals.

Herein, we report its first practical application in experimental parkinsonism, which consisted of transfecting dopamine neurons with the gene coding for human glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (hGDNF). Hemiparkinsonism was induced in rats by a single dose of 6-hydroxydopamine (30 mu g) into the ventrolateral part of the striatum. We showed that transfection of the hGDNF gene into the substantia nigra of rats I week after the neurotoxin injection produced biochemical, anatomical, and functional recovery from hemiparkinsonism. RT-PCR analysis showed mRNA expression of exogenous hGDNF in the transfected substantia nigra. Western blot analysis verified transgene expression by recognizing the flag epitope added at the C-terminus of the hGDNF polypeptide, which was found mainly in dopamine neurons by double immunofluorescence techniques. These data indicate that the neurotensin polyplex holds great promise for the neuroprotective therapy of Parkinson disease.

Study 1 demonstrated that pursuing autonomous goals was positively associated with both happiness and self-realization, whereas pursuing controlled goals was negatively associated with self-realization, but unrelated to happiness. Study 1 further revealed that self-realization was negatively associated with physical symptoms, whereas happiness was unrelated to the symptoms. Study 2 replicated the findings of Study 1 while showing that academic stress mediated the relationship between self-realization and physical symptoms. Finally, Study 3 replicated the findings of Studies 1 and 2 and additionally demonstrated that academic coping mediated the relationship between self-realization and academic stress. These findings are discussed in terms of their theoretical implications and directions for future research are proposed.

Behavioral studies suggest that drug availability and withdrawal can affect the individual response to drug cues. Moreover, the importance of subjective craving in cue-induced relapse has been questioned and an alternative model put forward according to which drug cues trigger habitual drug-seeking behaviors independently of craving. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to compare the brain response to smoking and control videotapes in 20 healthy smokers, while varying their expectancy to smoke and abstinence levels. The neural response to cigarette cues was strongly modulated by expectancy and, to a lesser extent, abstinence. In people expecting to smoke immediately after the scan, smoking cues activated brain areas implicated in arousal, attention, and cognitive control. However, when subjects knew they would not be allowed to smoke for 4 h, there was almost no brain activation in response to smoking cues, despite equivalent reported levels of craving. In the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, the neural response was a function of both craving and expectancy. Thalamo-cingulate connectivity, thought to be an index of arousal, was greater during expectancy than nonexpectancy. Our findings confirm the importance of expectancy in the neural response to drug cues, and lend support to the theory that these cues act on brain areas involved in arousal and attention.

SGP-1 has been reported as a neurotrophic factor, though little is known of its effect on neurite outgrowth, and it is unknown whether SGP-1 affects synaptic development. We report here that SGP-1 is distributed in vesicle-like puncta in somas and dendrites of primary neurons in culture, and that SGP-1 is secreted in culture and is taken up by endocytosis in dendrites. Endogenous extracellular activity of SGP-1 promotes dendritic, but not axonal outgrowth. Furthermore, endogenous activity of SGP-1 increases synaptogenesis in hippocampal neurons as determined by measuring the density and size of synaptophysin puncta and by determining the density of dendritic spines, their surface expression of GluR2 and their immunoreactivity for GluR1 The effect of SGP-1 on the amount of postsynaptic receptors in dendritic spines depends on synaptic activity and apparently on activation of MAPK, as inhibition of either of these abolished the affect. Hence, SGP-1 has neurotrophic effects, increasing dendritic growth and promoting synaptic development in an activity-dependent fashion.

A unifying synovial (articular) theory explains extraneural and intraneural ganglia in terms of their dissection through capsular defects separate from or within articular branch connections. Depending on the site of the capsular defect.. these cysts tend to form along paths of least resistance and take shape by pressure fluxes. Identification of the non-neural or neural joint connection ("pedicle") and its surgical removal is important to decrease recurrence and to improve patient outcomes. New imaging techniques can help the radiologist and treating surgeon detect the pedicle, obtain a preoperative diagnosis and direct the nature of the intervention. This review summarizes recent advances in the pathogenesis, evaluation, and management of patients with ganglia affecting nerve.

Until recently, seven genes have been identified that cause LCA. Clarifying the relation between LCA and associated neurological abnormalities such as autism, seizures, and hypotony, and unraveling the relationship between the ocular LCA phenotype and that associated with distinct systemic entities such as Joubert syndrome, Senior-Loken syndrome and Saldino-Mainzer syndrome has taken on new importance with the discovery that a substantial proportion of patients with LCA have mutations in the CEP290 gene that causes Joubert syndrome. This commentary explores the implications of this recent discovery and revisits the classification of LCA.

Design: Cross-sectional study. Participants: One hundred ninety-four normotensive RASS participants in 3 centers who are 16 years of age or older with type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM) of 2 to 20 years' duration. Methods: Ambulatory blood pressure and APR were monitored using standardized protocols. Patients were defined as nondippers if the night-to-day ratios for both systolic and diastolic blood pressures were > 0.9. Diabetic retinopathy was determined by masked grading of 30 color stereoscopic fundus photographs of 7 standard fields using the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study severity scale. Main Outcome Measure: Severity of DR. Results: No DR was present in 32%, mild nonproliferative DR (NPDR) was present in 55%, and moderate to severe NPDR or proliferative DR was present in 13% of the cohort. Neither 24-hour systolic ABP or diastolic ABP, daytime systolic or diastolic ABP, nor nighttime diastolic ABP were related to severity of DR. Statistically significant associations were found between nighttime systolic ABP and mean ABP and DR. Among those with no DR, 19% were nondippers; for those with mild NPDR, 28% were nondippers; and for those with severe NPDR or proliferative DR, 36% were nondippers (P = 0.08). The ratio of nighttime to daytime APR, but not the 24-hour APR or daytime or nighttime APR, was related positively to the severity of DR. In multivariable analyses, only the nighttime systolic ABP was related to severity of DR (P < 0.05). Conclusions: These data suggest that ABP, especially during the night, may provide a better measure than clinical BP regarding the relationship of BP to the severity of retinopathy in normotensive persons with type 1 DM without clinical DN.

Intraventricular injection of 50 or 100 ng AVP dose-dependently increased the pain threshold; in contrast, intraventricular injection of 10 mu l anti-AVP serum decreased the pain threshold; both intrathecal injection of 200 ng AVP or 10,l anti-AVP serum and intravenous injection of 5 mu g AVP or 200 mu l anti-AVP serum did not influence the pain threshold. Pain stimulation reduced AVP concentration in hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN), and elevated AVP concentration in hypothalamic supraoptical nucleus (SON) and periaqueductal gray (PAG), but no change in AVP concentration was detected in pituitary, spinal cord and serum. The results indicated that AVP regulation of antinociception was limited to the brain nuclei. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The structure of turbinatocoumarin (1) was assigned as 5-methoxy-3-[3-(beta-glucopyranosyloxy)-2-hydroxy-3-methylbutyl]psoralen by means of spectroscopic analysis. Known compounds have also been isolated from this genus and identified as (2'S, 3'R)-3'-hydroxymarmesin (2), 5-methoxy-3-(3-methyl-2,3-dihydroxybutyl)psoraten (3), psoralen (4), kanzonol C (5) which was isolated for the first time from this genus, 4-hydroxylonchocarpin (6), umbelliferone, 4-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzaldehyde and 4-methoxyphenol. As part of our continuing search for potential naturally-occurring antitumor drug candidates, the inhibition of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 secretion from brain tumor-derived glioblastorna cells by the isolated compounds 1, 3, 5, and 6 was evaluated by zymography and compared to the documented naturally-occurring MMP secretion inhibitors chlorogenic acid (CHL) and epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCg). Among the compounds tested, the inhibiting MMP secretion concentrations ranged from 0.025 to 250 mu M with up to 80% inhibition. The inhibitory activities of compounds 5 and 6 were found comparable to the common reference compounds CHL and EGCg. This suggests that alternate sources can be explored and exploited for the availability of chemopreventive molecules. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In the present study, 57 undergraduate students served as participants. All subjects provided salivary samples and completed psychological inventories during a low examination stress period and again during a high examination stress period. Salivary samples were analyzed for cortisol. Three major findings were observed. First, the examination stress protocol proved to be an effective trigger of elevations in both psychological measures of stress and in cortisol levels. Second, sex differences were observed in cortisol levels, such that males showed an elevation in cortisol during the high examination stress session whereas females did not. Finally, no significant correlations were observed between elevations in psychological measures of stress and elevations in cortisol levels. These findings suggest that the examination stress protocol used in the present study effectively elevated both psychological stress and cortisol levels. Furthermore, these findings suggest that there are biological differences in how males and females respond to stress. Finally, no evidence was found to suggest a relationship between psychological and hormonal levels of stress. Together, these findings suggest the need to better define and consider the implications of both the specific measures of stress being used and individual differences in the subject samples in psychoendocrine studies.

It is common for more than one metastasis to be treated during the same SRS session. We retrospectively identified four cases where our m3 micro multileaf collimator (mMLC) was used to create two distinct apertures and treat adjacent lesions using a single isocenter. For these four cases, single isocenter plans with static conformal beams were dosimetrically compared to plans utilizing two isocenters with static conformal beams or conformal arcs. The effects on dose homogeneity, dose conformity, and the minimum isodose separating the two targets are minor and variable. On the other hand, the use of a single isocenter technique consistently halves delivery time and decreases the integral dose to normal tissue. For small adjacent metastases, which can simultaneously be encompassed within the highresolution portion of the m3/Novalis mMLC collimator, the use of a single rather than a dual isocenter technique is feasible and generally advantageous.

During development, trafficking of mRNAs to both axonal and dendritic growth cones regulates neuronal growth. After synapse formation, mRNAs continue to be transported to dendrites both as a mechanism for the localization of proteins to specific compartments and as a substrate for local translational regulation of synaptic plasticity. Finally, activity-dependent mRNAs are transported quickly to dendrites after transcription. Determining how mRNAs are transported and specifically translated in these different paradigms is a major unanswered question. Addressing this question is also complicated by the presence of many other RNA processing and storage centers that may not be involved in transport but share components with the transport structures. In the present review, we will discuss several recent studies addressing mechanisms of mRNA transport in neurons, as well as proteomic characterization of mRNA transporting structures in neurons. We define two types of RNA transport structures in neurons, transport particles and RNA granules and distinguish them by the presence or absence of ribosomes. We will present a number of different molecular models for how mRNAs are repressed during transport, and how these may affect the regulation of local translation in neurons.

Anisotropic local contrast normalization: The role of stimulus orientation and spatial frequency bandwidths in the oblique and horizontal effect perceptual anisotropies	VISION RESEARCH			English	Article						contrast gain control; response normalization; horizontal effect; oblique effect; broadband stimuli; natural scenes	CAT STRIATE CORTEX; PRIMARY VISUAL-CORTEX; GAIN-CONTROL; HUMAN VISION; PERCEIVED CONTRAST; SIMPLE CELLS; DIRECTION SELECTIVITY; LUMINANCE GRATINGS; LATERAL INHIBITION; RECEPTIVE-FIELDS	Visual ability for sine waves and other narrowband stimuli shows an oblique effect-worst performance at obliques, best at horizontal and vertical orientations. Recently, we have shown that with broadband stimuli (either 1/f(alpha) visual noise or natural scenes), performance for detecting oriented content is worst at horizontal, best at the obliques, and intermediate at vertical orientations (a "horizontal effect"). This horizontal effect has been explained by a cortical contrast normalization model that is both local (over orientation and spatial frequency) and anisotropic (due to a numerical bias of neurons with different preferred orientations). Here, the bandwidth of content at which an oblique effect or horizontal effect occurs was assessed in two suprathreshold matching experiments conducted with 1/f(alpha) noise stimuli filtered with a triangle increment function of varied bandwidth (16 levels of orientation and spatial frequency bandwidth). The results provided further support for the local anisotropic normalization model in that an oblique effect was observed when a fairly small range of orientations and high spatial frequencies were tested and the horizontal effect was observed for broadband increments >= 20 degrees orientation bandwidth and >= 1-octave in frequency. At intermediate spatial frequency and orientation increment bandwidths, a blend of the two anisotropies was observed. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Several methods have been developed for this purpose and one of the most famous techniques is the Auto regressive moving average (ARMA) model. In the research reported here, the goal was to minimize the error for a specific season of the year as well as for the complete series. Goal programming (GP) was used to estimate the ARMA model parameters. Shaloo Bridge station on the Karun River with 68 years of observed stream flow data was selected to evaluate the performance of the proposed method.

J	Gagnon, D; Nadeau, S; Tam, V				Gagnon, Dany; Nadeau, Sylvie; Tam, Vincent			Ideal timing to transfer from an acute care hospital to an interdisciplinary inpatient rehabilitation program following a stroke: an exploratory study	BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH			English	Article							MEDICAL REHABILITATION; FUNCTIONAL OUTCOMES; IMPAIRMENT; DISABILITY; ADMISSION; LENGTH; TRIAL; STAY	Background: Timely accessibility to organized inpatient stroke rehabilitation services may become compromised since the demand for rehabilitation services following stroke is rapidly growing with no promise of additional resources. This often leads to prolonged lengths of stays in acute care facilities for individuals surviving a stroke. It is believed that this delay spent in acute care facilities may inhibit the crucial motor recovery process taking place shortly after a stroke. It is important to document the ideal timing to initiate intensive inpatient stroke rehabilitation after the neurological event. Therefore, the objective of this study was to examine the specific influence of short, moderate and long onset-admission intervals (OAI) on rehabilitation outcomes across homogeneous subgroups of patients who were admitted to a standardized interdisciplinary inpatient stroke rehabilitation program. Methods: A total of 418 patients discharged from the inpatient neurological rehabilitation program at the Montreal Rehabilitation Hospital Network after a first stroke (79% of all cases reviewed) were included in this retrospective study. After conducting a matching procedure across these patients based on the degree of disability, gender, and age, a total of 40 homogeneous triads (n = 120) were formed according to the three OAI subgroups: short ( less than 20 days), moderate ( between 20 and 40 days) or long ( over 40 days; maximum of 70 days) OAI subgroups. The rehabilitation outcomes ( admission and discharge Functional Independence Measure scores (FIM), absolute and relative FIM gain scores, rehabilitation length of stay, efficiency scores) were evaluated to test for differences between the three OAI subgroups. Results: Analysis revealed that the three OAI subgroups were comparable for all rehabilitation outcomes studied. No statistical difference was found for admission ( P = 0.305 - 0.972) and discharge ( P = 0.083 - 0.367) FIM scores, absolute ( P = 0.533 - 0.647) and relative ( P = 0.496 - 0.812) FIM gain scores, rehabilitation length of stay ( P = 0.096), and efficiency scores ( P = 0.103 - 0.674). Conclusion: OAI does not seem to affect significantly inpatient stroke rehabilitation outcomes of patients referred from acute care facilities where rehabilitation services are rapidly initiated after the onset of the stroke and offered throughout their stay. However, other studies considering factors such as the type and intensity of the rehabilitation are required to support those results.

The sum-of-products form is desirable because it reduces the cost of doing the quadratures required for quantum dynamics calculations. It also greatly facilitates the use of the multiconfiguration time dependent Hartree method. Unlike potfit product representation algorithm, the new NN approach does not require using a grid of points. It also produces sum-of-products potentials with fewer terms. As the number of dimensions is increased, we expect the advantages of the exponential NN idea to become more significant. (c) 2006 American Institute of Physics.

We show that membrane proteins with noninteractive external domains attached to the same carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) GPI anchor, but not to unrelated neural cell adhesion molecule GPI anchors, colocalize on the cell surface, confirming that the GPI anchor mediates association with specific membrane domains and providing a mechanism for specific signaling. This directed targeting was exploited by coexpressing an external domain-defective protein with a functional protein, both with the CEA GPI anchor. The result was a complete loss of signaling capabilities (through integrin-ECM interaction) and cellular effect (differentiation blockage) of the active protein, which involved an alteration of the size of the microdomains occupied by the active protein. This work clarifies how the GPI anchor can determine protein function, while offering a novel method for its modulation.

Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide directly modulates the activity of proopiomelanocortin neurons in the rat arcuate nucleus	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						PACAP; POMC; alpha-MSH; feeding behavior; hypothalamus; neuroendocrine functions	VASOACTIVE INTESTINAL POLYPEPTIDE; GONADOTROPIN-RELEASING-HORMONE; MESSENGER-RIBONUCLEIC-ACID; GENE-EXPRESSION; LUTEINIZING-HORMONE; 2 RECEPTORS; PACAP; BRAIN; HYPOTHALAMUS; LOCALIZATION	Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) and the proopiomelanocortin (POMC)-derived peptide alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH) both regulate multiple neuroendocrine functions and feeding behavior. Two subtypes of PACAP receptor mRNAs, pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypepide-specific receptor (PAC1-R) and pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide/vasoactive intestinal polypeptide mutual receptor (VPAC2-R), are actively expressed in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus, where POMC cell bodies are located. This observation led us to investigate the possible regulatory action of PACAP on rat POMC neurons, Double-labeling in situ hybridization histochemistry revealed that approximately 5.0% of POMC-producing neurons express PAC1-R and/or VPAC2-R mRNAs. The proportion of POW neurons that also contain PAC1-R mRNA was homogeneous along the rostro-caudal axis,of the arcuate nucleus while POMC-positive cell bodies expressing the VPAC2-R subtype were more abundant in the rostral region. Incubation of mediobasal hypothalamic explants with PACAP (10(-7) M; 30 min) increased POMC mRNA expression, and this effect was blocked by PACAP6 38 (10(-6) M). in contrast, incubation with vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (10(-7) M) did not affect POMC mRNA level. Incubation of hypothalamic fragments with PACAP (10(-7) M) caused a significant increase in a-MSH content in the tissue and in the incubation medium. Altogether,, the present results reveal that exogenous PACAP, acting probably through PAC1-R, regulates the activity of POMC neurons in the rat hypothalamus. These data suggest that the effects of PACAP on the gonadotropin-releasing hormone neuroendocrine axis and the regulation of feeding behavior may be mediated, at least in part, through modulation of POW neurons.

Boc is a receptor for sonic hedgehog in the guidance of commissural axons	NATURE			English	Article							IG SUPERFAMILY MEMBER; MYOGENIC DIFFERENTIATION; NERVOUS-SYSTEM; CDO; PROTEINS; PATHWAY; GENE; MICE; EXPRESSION; COMPONENTS	In the spinal cord, sonic hedgehog ( Shh) is secreted by the floor plate to control the generation of distinct classes of ventral neurons along the dorsoventral axis (1). Genetic and in vitro studies have shown that Shh also later acts as a midline- derived chemoattractant for commissural axons(2). However, the receptor( s) responsible for Shh attraction remain unknown. Here we show that two Robo-related proteins, Boc and Cdon, bind specifically to Shh and are therefore candidate receptors for the action of Shh as an axon guidance ligand. Boc is expressed by commissural neurons, and targeted disruption of Boc in mouse results in the misguidance of commissural axons towards the floor plate. RNA- interference-mediated knockdown of Boc impairs the ability of rat commissural axons to turn towards an ectopic source of Shh in vitro. Taken together, these data suggest that Boc is essential as a receptor for Shh in commissural axon guidance.

We have reported on a neural enhancer of Hoxd4 that directs expression in the CNS with the correct anterior border in the hindbrain. Comparison to the orthologous enhancer of zebrafish revealed seven conserved footprints including an obligatory retinoic acid response element (RARE), and adjacent sites D, E and F. Whereas enhancer function in the embryonic CNS is destroyed by separation of the RARE from sites DE-F by a half turn of DNA, it is rescued by one full turn, suggesting stereospecific constraints between DNA-bound retinoid receptors and the factor(s) recognizing sites D-E-F. Alterations in the DV trajectory of the Hoxd4 anterior expression border following mutation of site D or E implicated transcriptional regulators active across the DV axis. We show that PAX6 specifically binds sites D and E in vitro, and use chromatin immunoprecipitation to demonstrate recruitment of PAX6 to the Hoxd4 neural enhancer in mouse embryos. Hoxd4 expression throughout the CNS is reduced in Pax6 mutant Sey(Neu) animals on embryonic day 8. Additionally, stage-matched zebrafish embryos having decreased pax6a and/or pax6b activity display malformed rhombomere boundaries and an anteriorized hoxd4a expression border. These results reveal an evolutionarily conserved role for Pax6 in AP-restricted expression of vertebrate Hoxd4 orthologs. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

While they represent only a small fraction of the whole cell population, their properties confer an important place in several investigations. SP cells express high levels of various members of ABC transporters family, such as MDR1 and BCRP, which are responsible for drug resistance. Targeting SP could improve cancer therapy by blocking these transporters. In addition, SP appear to be enriched in stem cells, cells that play a pivotal role in normal development and cancer biology. Thus, they could provide a useful tool and a readily accessible source for stem cell studies in both the normal and cancerous settings. However, these cells are poorly defined and pose challenges in their identification and isolation, particularly since they are few in number. Thus, better characterization of SP will advance our understanding of stem cells and will provide us an accessible target for drug resistance in cancer therapy. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

In the PNS, perisynaptic Schwann cells (PSCs) are the glial cells associated with the pre- and postsynaptic elements of the neuromuscular junction (NMJ). They, as other glial cells of the CNS, respond to high-frequency motor nerve stimulation with an increase in intracellular Ca2+. In addition to detecting and responding to neurotransmission, PSCs are involved in short-term plasticity events where they depress neurotransmission through G-protein-dependent mechanisms and potentiate synaptic activity via Ca2+-dependent mechanisms. In this review, we will discuss evidence that outlines the role of PSCs in short- and long-term modulation of synaptic activity.

This involves cellular migration across various structures associated with the blood-brain barrier: the vascular endothelium, the glia limitans, and the perivascular space between them. Leukocytes accumulate spontaneously in the perivascular space in brains of transgenic (Tg) mice that overexpress CCL2 under control of a CNS-specific promoter. The Tg mice show no clinical symptoms, even though leukocytes have crossed the endothelial basement membrane. Pertussis toxin (PTx) given i.p. induced encephalopathy and weight loss in Tg mice. We used flow cytometry, ultra-small superparamagnetic iron oxide-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging, and immunofluorescent staining to show that encephalopathy involved leukocyte migration across the glia limitans into the brain parenchyma, identifying this as the critical step in inducing clinical symptoms. Metalloproteinase (MPs) enzymes are implicated in leukocyte infiltration in neuroinflammation. Unmanipulated Tg mice had elevated expression of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-10, and -12 mRNA in the brain. PTx further induced expression of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1, metalloproteinase disintegrins-12, NIMP-8, and -10 in brains of Tg mice. Levels of the microglial-associated NIP MMP-15 were not affected in control or PTx-treated Tg mice. PTx also up-regulated expression of proinflammatory cytokines IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha mRNA in Tg CNS. Weight loss and parenchymal infiltration, but not perivascular accumulation, were significantly inhibited by the broad-spectrum MP inhibitor BB-94/Batimastat. Our finding that MPs mediate PTx-induced parenchymal infiltration to the chemokine-overexpressing CNS has relevance for the pathogenesis of human diseases involving CNS inflammation, such as multiple sclerosis.

Cortical trapping of alpha-[C-11]methyl-L-tryptophan, an index of serotonin synthesis, is lower in females than males	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	34th Annual Meeting of the Society-for-Neuroscience	OCT 23-27, 2004	San Diego, CA	Soc Neurosci			POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; NATIONAL COMORBIDITY SURVEY; IRRITABLE-BOWEL-SYNDROME; METHYL-L-TRYPTOPHAN; CEREBROSPINAL-FLUID; SEX-DIFFERENCES; HUMAN-BRAIN; 5-HYDROXYINDOLEACETIC ACID; ALPHA-METHYLTRYPTOPHAN; HEALTHY-VOLUNTEERS	One neural system that may exhibit gender differences is serotonin (5-HT), a neurotransmitter implicated in the regulation of mood, cognitive processes, and impulse-control. However, most of the available evidence of gender-related differences in this system has been indirect and at times contradictory. The objective of the present study was to follow up on preliminary evidence that there are gender differences in brain regional 5-HT synthesis, as measured by trapping of alpha[C-11]methyl-L-tryptophan (alpha-[C-11]MTrp). Sixty-minute dynamic scans were performed in healthy volunteers, 28 women and 31 men. Functional images of the brain trapping constant, used as a proxy for 5-HT synthesis, which correlate in the rat brain with tryptophan's conversion into 5-HT, were transferred to the standardized 3D space. The voxel based comparison was performed by Statistical Parametric Mapping with proportional normalization. There was lower normalized alpha-[C-11]MTrp trapping in females than males throughout much of the cerebral cortex, including the left middle frontal gyrus, the bilateral inferior frontal gyrus, the bilateral precentral gyrus the left supramarginal gyrus, the bilateral inferior parietal lobule, the left superior temporal gyrus, the bilateral posterior cingulate gyrus, and the bilateral precuneus. There were no regions in which the normalized trapping was significantly higher in females than in males. Gender differences in sub-cortical sites were not found. Women, compared to men, may have lower rates of this tracer trapping, used as a proxy for 5-HT synthesis, throughout much of the cerebral cortex which is likely related to differences in 5-HT synthesis because relative differences in the normalized trapping should be the same as those in 5-HT synthesis. These differences may be related, at least in part, to previously suggested gender differences in affect, cognitive processes, and susceptibility to 5-HT-related neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders.

To determine whether this event might be amenable to brain imaging, the present [F-18]MPPF positron emission tomographic (PET) study was carried out in anesthetized cats given or not a single dose (5 mg/kg, i.v.) or chronically treated with fluoxetine (5 mg/kg, s.c. for 21 days). Compared to control, [F-18]MPPF binding potential was considerably (and visibly) decreased in the cat NRD after acute fluoxetine treatment, while it remained unchanged in other brain regions. Unexpectedly, after chronic fluoxetine treatment, [F-18]MPPF binding potential was not affected in any brain region. In parallel immunoelectron microscopic experiments carried out in rat, the density of 5-HT1A autoreceptors on the plasma membrane of NRD dendrites was comparable to control after chronic fluoxetine treatment. If the decrease in [F-18]MPPF binding at the onset of SSRI treatment was detectable by PET imaging, it could potentially serve as a biological index of efficacy. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Striatal dopamine release during performance of executive functions: A [C-11] raclopride PET study	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						positron emission tomography; functional imaging; raclopride; dopamine; basal ganglia; executive functions; cognition	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; WORKING-MEMORY; BASAL GANGLIA; COGNITIVE FUNCTION; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; LIGAND; RECEPTOR; BINDING; HUMANS	To date, while the contribution of the striatum in executive processes is well documented, the role played by striatal dopamine during tasks requiring executive functions is still unknown. We used D2-dopamine receptor ligand [C-11] raclopride PET in healthy subjects while performing the Montreal Card Sorting Task (MCST). We observed a striatal reduction in [C-11] raclopride binding potential during planning of a set-shift when compared with matching according to an ongoing rule. These findings suggest that striatal dopamine neurotransmission increases significantly during the performance of specific executive processes confirming previous evidence of striatal activation during FMRI studies. The present observation may provide some insights on the origin of cognitive deficits underlying certain neurological disorders associated with dopamine dysfunction, such as Parkinson's disease.

Contribution of the frontal lobe to externally and internally specified verbal responses: fMRI evidence	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						speech production; language; supplementary motor area; pre-supplementary motor area; ventral premotor area; response selection; externally and internally specified responses	SUPPLEMENTARY MOTOR AREA; POSITRON EMISSION TOMOGRAPHY; ADJACENT CINGULATE CORTEX; WORD-STEM COMPLETION; EVENT-RELATED FMRI; MACAQUE MONKEY; PREMOTOR CORTEX; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; WILLED ACTION	It has been suggested that within the frontal cortex there is a lateral to medial shift in the control of action, with the lateral premotor area (PMA) involved in externally specified actions and the medial supplementary motor areas (SMA) involved in internally specified actions. Recent brain imaging studies demonstrate, however, that the control of externally and internally specified actions may involve more complex and overlapping networks involving not only the PMA and the SMA, but also the pre-SMA and the lateral prefrontal cortex (PFC). The aim of the present study was to determine whether these frontal regions are differentially involved in the production of verbal responses, when they are externally specified and when they are internally specified. Participants engaged in three overt speaking tasks in which the degree of response specification differed. The tasks involved reading aloud words (externally specified), or generating words aloud from narrow or broad semantic categories (internally specified). Using fMRI, the location and magnitude of the BOLD activity for these tasks was measured in a group of ten participants. Compared with rest, all tasks activated the primary motor area and the SMA-proper, reflecting their common role in speech production. The magnitude of the activity in the PFC (Brodmann area 45), the left PMAv and the pre-SMA increased for word generation, suggesting that each of these three regions plays a role in internally specified action selection. This confirms previous reports concerning the participation of the pre-SMA in verbal response selection. The pattern of activity in PMAv suggests participation in both externally and internally specified verbal actions. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Methods: We performed cerebral blood flow evaluation using (99)mTc-Ethylene Cysteinate Dimer (ECD) SPECT on eight patients with polysomnographically confirmed RBD and nine age-matched controls. Comparisons were made using SPM2. Results: We found increased perfusion in the pons and putamen bilaterally and in the right hippocampus. In addition, we observed a decreased perfusion in frontal (Brodmann area [BA] 4, 6, 10, 43, 44, 47 bilaterally and left BA 9, 46) and temporo-parietal (BA 13, 22, 43 bilaterally and left BA 7, 19, 20, 21, 39, 40, 41, 42) cortices. Conclusion: Perfusional abnormalities in patients with REM behavior disorder were located in the brainstem, striatum, and cortex. These abnormalities are consistent with the anatomic metabolic profile of Parkinson disease.

Modeling ice growth on Canadian lakes using artificial neural networks	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH			English	Article							CLIMATE-CHANGE; FRAZIL ICE; RIVER ICE; SIMULATION; RAINFALL; COVER; VARIABILITY	[1] This paper presents artificial neural network ( ANN) models designed to predict ice in Canadian lakes and reservoirs during the early winter ice thickness growth period. The models fit ice thickness measurements at one or more monitored lakes and predict ice thickness during the growth period either at the same locations for dates without measurements ( local ANN models) or at any site in the region ( regional ANN model), provided that the required meteorological input variables are available. The input variables were selected after preliminary assessments and were adapted from time series of daily mean air temperature, rainfall, cloud cover, solar radiation, and average snow depth. The results of the ANN models compared well with those of the deterministic physics-driven Canadian Lake Ice Model (CLIMO) in terms of root-mean-square error and in terms of relative root-mean-square errors. The ANN models predictions were also marginally more precise than a revised version of Stefan's law (RSL), presented herein. They reproduced some intrawinter and interannual growth rate fluctuations that were not accounted for by RSL. The performance of the models results in good part from a careful choice of input variables, inspired from the work on deterministic models such as CLIMO. ANN models of ice thickness show good potential for the use in contexts where ad hoc adjustments are desirable because of the limited availability of measurements and where poor data nature, availability, and quality precludes using deterministic physics-driven models.

Compartmentalized Ca2+ channel regulation at divergent mossy-fiber release sites underlies target cell-dependent plasticity	NEURON			English	Article							METABOTROPIC GLUTAMATE-RECEPTOR; LONG-TERM POTENTIATION; SINGLE NERVE-TERMINALS; FEEDFORWARD INHIBITION; RAT HIPPOCAMPUS; TRANSMITTER RELEASE; PYRAMIDAL CELLS; SYNAPTIC TRANSMISSION; PRESYNAPTIC CALCIUM; NEUROTRANSMITTER RELEASE	Hippocampal mossy fibers (MFs) innervate CA3 targets via anatomically distinct presynaptic elements: MF boutons (MFBs) innervate pyramidal cells (PYRs), whereas filopodial extensions (Fils) of MFBs innervate st. lucidum interneurons (SLINs). Surprisingly, the same high-frequency stimulation (HFS) protocol induces presynaptically expressed LTP and LTD at PYR and SLIN inputs, respectively. This differential distribution of plasticity indicates that neighboring, functionally divergent presynaptic elements along the same axon serve as autonomous computational elements capable of modifying release independently. Indeed we report that HFS persistently depresses voltage-gated calcium channel (VGCC) function in Fil terminals, leaving MFB VGCCs unchanged despite similar contributions of N- and P/Q-type VGCCs to transmission at each terminal. Selective Fil VGCC depression results from HFS-induced mGluR7 activation leading to persistent P/Q-type VGCC inhibition. Thus, mGluR7 localization to MF-SLIN terminals and not MFBs allows for MF-SLIN LTD expression via depressed presynaptic VGCC function, whereas MF-PYR plasticity proceeds independently of VGCC alterations.

Many genes implicated in these processes may be present in low abundance in the human brain. DNA microarray analysis identifies changed genes that are expressed at high or moderate levels. Complementary to this approach, we described here a novel technology designed specifically to isolate rare and novel genes previously undetectable by other methods. We have used this method to identify differentially expressed genes in brains affected by AD. Our method, termed (S) under bar ubtractive (T) under bar ranscription-based (A) under bar mplification of mRNA (STAR), is a combination of subtractive RNA/DNA hybridization and RNA amplification, which allows the removal of non-differentially expressed transcripts and the linear amplification of the differentially expressed genes. Results: Using the STAR technology we have identified over 800 differentially expressed sequences in AD brains, both up- and down-regulated, compared to age-matched controls. Over 55% of the sequences represent genes of unknown function and roughly half of them were novel and rare discoveries in the human brain. The expression changes of nearly 80 unique genes were further confirmed by qRT-PCR and the association of additional genes with AD and/or neurodegeneration was established using an in-house literature mining tool (LitMiner). Conclusion: The STAR process significantly amplifies unique and rare sequences relative to abundant housekeeping genes and, as a consequence, identifies genes not previously linked to AD.

Similarly, myelination by Schwann cells is polarized, but the mechanisms involved remain unclear. Here, we show that the polarity protein Par-3 localizes asymmetrically in Schwann cells at the axon-glial junction and that disruption of Par-3 localization, by overexpression and knockdown, inhibits myelination. Additionally, we show that Par-3 directly associates and recruits the p75 neurotrophin receptor to the axon-glial junction, forming a complex necessary for myelination. Together, these results point to a critical role in the establishment of cell polarity for myelination.

This study investigated whether neuronally induced atrial arrhythmias can be modulated by SCS. In 16 anesthetized dogs with intact stellate ganglia and in five with bilateral stellectomy, trains of five electrical stimuli were delivered during the atrial refractory period to right- or left-sided mediastinal nerves for up to 20 s before and after SCS (20 min). Recordings were obtained from 191 biatrial epicardial sites. Before SCS (11 animals), mediastinal nerve stimulation initiated bradycardia alone (12 nerve sites), bradycardia followed by tachyarrhythmia/fibrillation (50 sites), as well as tachyarrhythmia/fibrillation without a preceding bradycardia (21 sites). After SCS, the number of responsive sites inducing bradycardia was reduced by 25% (62 to 47 sites), and the cycle length prolongation in residual bradycardias was reduced. The number of responsive sites inducing tachyarrhythmia was reduced by 60% (71 to 29 sites). Once elicited, residual tachyarrhythmias arose from similar epicardial foci, displaying similar dynamics (cycle length) as in control states. In the absence of SCS, bradycardias and tachyarrhythmias induced by repeat nerve stimulation were reproducible (five additional animals). After bilateral stellectomy, SCS no longer influenced neuronal induction of bradycardia and atrial tachyarrhythmias. These data indicate that SCS obtunds the induction of atrial arrhythmias resulting from excessive activation of intrinsic cardiac neurons and that such protective effects depend on the integrity of nerves coursing via the subclavian ansae and stellate ganglia.

Circulating interleukin-6 induces fever through a STAT3-linked activation of COX-2 in the brain	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY-REGULATORY INTEGRATIVE AND COMPARATIVE PHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						local inflammation; cytokines; nuclear factor-kappa B; prostaglandins; circumventricular organs	FACTOR-KAPPA-B; SENSORY CIRCUMVENTRICULAR ORGANS; NUCLEAR STAT3 TRANSLOCATION; INDUCIBLE CYCLOOXYGENASE EXPRESSION; ACUTE-PHASE RESPONSES; RAT-BRAIN; LOCALIZED INFLAMMATION; TRANSCRIPTIONAL ACTIVATION; ENDOTHELIAL-CELLS; FEBRILE RESPONSE	Interleukin (IL)-6 is an important humoral mediator of fever following infection and inflammation and satisfies a number of criteria for a circulating pyrogen. However, evidence supporting such a role is diminished by the moderate or even absent ability of the recombinant protein to induce fever and activate the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) pathway in the brain, a prerequisite step in the initiation and maintenance of fever. In the present study, we investigated the role of endogenous circulating IL-6 in a rodent model of localized inflammation, by neutralizing its action using a specific antiserum (IL-6AS). Rats were injected with LPS (100 mu g/kg) or saline into a preformed air pouch in combination with an intraperitoneal injection of either normal sheep serum or IL-6AS (1.8 ml/rat). LPS induced a febrile response, which was accompanied by a significant rise in plasma IL-6 and nuclear STAT3 translocation in endothelial cells throughout the brain 2 h after treatment, including areas surrounding the sensory circumventricular organs and the median preoptic area (MnPO), important regions in mediating fever. These responses were abolished in the presence of the IL-6AS, which also significantly inhibited the LPS-induced up-regulation of mRNA expression or immunoreactivity (IR) of the inducible form of COX, the rate-limiting enzyme for PGE(2)-synthesis. Interestingly, nuclear signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 3-positive cells colocalized with COX-2-IR, signifying that IL-6-activated cells are directly involved in PGE(2) production. These observations suggest that IL-6 is an important circulating pyrogen that activates the COX-2-pathway in cerebral microvasculature, most likely through a STAT3-dependent pathway.

Fifty craniotomy patients were randomly divided into two groups: morphine (morphine 0.1 mg center dot kg(-1) IV after dural closure and an SNB performed with 20 mL of 0.9% saline at the end of surgery) and block (10 mL of 0.9% saline instead of morphine after dural closure and an SNB performed with a 1:1 mixture of bupivacaine 0.5% and lidocaine 2% at the end of surgery). Postoperative pain was assessed at 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, and 24 h using a 10-point numerical rating scale. Analgesia consisted of subcutaneous codeine. Average numerical rating scale scores were similar between the two groups at each time interval. Total codeine dosage was also similar, except at 4 h postoperatively when it was higher in the block group. The delay before administration of the first dose of codeine was not statistically different between groups: 45 min (20-2880) vs 30 min (10-2880), median and range for the block and morphine group, respectively. Postoperative hemodynamics were similar for both groups. The incidence of nausea and vomiting was slightly more frequent in the morphine group, but the occurrence of confusion did not differ between groups. In conclusion, SNB provides a quality of transitional analgesia that is similar to that of morphine with the same postoperative hemodynamic profile.

Systematic review of antipsychotics for the treatment of hospital-associated delirium in medically or surgically ill patients	ANNALS OF PHARMACOTHERAPY			English	Article						antipsychotics; delirium	INTENSIVE-CARE-UNIT; MECHANICALLY VENTILATED PATIENTS; RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIALS; SYMPTOM RATING-SCALE; DOUBLE-BLIND TRIAL; CANCER-PATIENTS; OLDER PATIENTS; HIP FRACTURE; HALOPERIDOL; QUALITY	OBJECTIVE: To determine which antipsychotic is associated with the greatest efficacy and safety when used for the pharmacotherapeutic management of delirium in medically or surgically ill patients. Abstracts, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and EMBASE databases (all to July 2006) were searched for trials evaluating the pharmacologic treatment of delirium in medically or surgically ill patients. The key terms used included delirium, agitation, or acute confusion, and antipsychotics, phenothiazine, butyrophenone, perphenazine, fluphenazine, clozapine, trifluorophenazine, loxapine, thioridazine, pimozide, molindone, haloperidol, methotrimeprazine, chlorpromazine, prochlorperazine, droperidol, rispericlone, quetiapine, ziprasiclone, amisulpride, or olanzapine. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Prospective, randomized, controlled trials comparing the clinical effects of antipsychotictherapy with placebo or comparing 2 antipsychotic treatments in an acute care setting were selected. Studies involving dementia-associated delirium, Alzheimer's disease-associated delirium, emergency department-associated acute agitation, acute brain trauma-associated agitation, or agitation secondary to underlying psychiatric afflictions such as depression or schizophrenia were excluded. All studies were evaluated independently by the 3 authors using a validated evaluation tool. Outcomes related to both efficacy and safety were collected. Four prospective trials were included in this systematic review. DATA SYNTHESIS: Antipsychotic agents, either atypical or typical, were effective compared with baseline for the treatment of delirium in medically or surgically ill patients without underlying cognitive disorders. Oral haloperidol was associated with more frequent extrapyramidal side effects, but overall, all agents were well tolerated. Interpretation of the published evidence is limited by the small sample sizes, varied patient populations, and comparative agents of the studies reviewed. CONCLUSIONS: The comparative studies evaluated here suggest that antipsychotic drugs are efficacious, when compared with baseline, and safe for the treatment of delirium. Haloperidol remains the most studied agent. Recommendation of one antipsychotic over another as a first-line pharmacologic intervention in the treatment of hospital-associated delirium is limited by the quality and quantity of data available. Better designed and larger studies evaluating the addition of antipsychotic agents to nonpharmacologic treatments are needed to measure the true effect of pharmacologic treatment.

Methods: Sixteen patients with open-angle glaucoma and 16 patients with ocular hypertension underwent Heidelberg retina tomography and scanning laser Doppler flowmetry in 1 eye before and at least 2 months after a mean 35% sustained therapeutic reduction in intraocular pressure. Patients were assigned to a thin or thick group based on their median central corneal thickness. Results: Compared with 16 patients with thick corneas (mean +/- SD central corneal thickness, 587 +/- 31 mu m), the 16 patients with thin corneas (518 +/- 32 mu m) had greater reductions in mean (36 +/- 32 vs 4 +/- 36 mu m, P = .003) and in maximum cup depth (73 +/- 107 vs 4 +/- 89 mu m, P = .02). These changes were not statistically significantly different between the patients with open-angle glaucoma and those with ocular hypertension. Smaller mean +/- SD improvements in neuroretinal rim blood flow were seen in patients with thinner corneas compared with those with thicker corneas (35 +/- 80 vs 110 +/- 111 arbitrary units, P = .04). Conclusion: Patients with open-angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension with thinner corneas show significantly greater shallowing of the cup, a surrogate marker for lamina cribrosa displacement (compliance), and smaller improvements of neuroretinal rim blood flow after intraocular pressure reduction.

Design: Comparative study. Setting: Geriatric center offering rehabilitation services. Participants: Convenience sample of 15 persons (age, 69.4 +/- 12.0y; >= 3mo poststroke) recruited in a geriatric center with rehabilitation services, and 13 control persons (67.8 +/- 7.5y) participated in the study. Interventions: Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures: Unilateral and bilateral movements toward I or 2 targets located beyond arm's length and positioned in 3 directions. Angular changes of both upper limbs and trunk were characterized in the sagittal, frontal, and horizontal planes. Results: During the bilateral task, the deficits of the kinematic joints of the paretic upper limb persisted in subjects with hemiparesis as compared with the corresponding upper limb in the control subjects (abduction shoulder: subjects with hemiparesis, 5.7 degrees +/- 5.3 degrees; control subjects, 0.7 degrees +/- 4.8 degrees; extension elbow: subjects with hemiparesis, 38.2 degrees +/- 14.2 degrees; control subjects, 52.8 degrees +/- 12.5 degrees) with a marked flexion of the trunk (subjects with hemiparesis, 33.7 degrees +/- 8.7 degrees; control subjects, 26.8 degrees +/- 5.8 degrees). The elbow extension of the nonparetic upper limb was reduced (subjects with hemiparesis, 41.0 degrees +/- 13.6 degrees; control subjects, 52.8 degrees +/- 12.5 degrees). Conclusions: The use of parallel bilateral reaching tasks and placing movements of the upper extremities in the subjects with hemiparesis contributed an increase in the trunk flexion rather than improve the motor performance of the paretic upper limb, especially with regard to increasing elbow extension.

Direct electrical stimulation of this circuitry produces a powerful rewarding effect, which is called brain stimulation reward. Chronic food restriction resulting in body weight loss potentiates brain stimulation reward, but in only in a subset of cases. This could reflect individual differences between rats or subtle difference in electrode location that lead to differential excitation of functionally different components of the neural circuitry underlying brain stimulation reward. To distinguish between these views, the influence of chronic food restriction on brain stimulation reward was assessed in rats bearing multiple stimulation electrodes. In 5 of 13 cases, the rewarding effects produced by stimulating different sites in the same rat were altered differentially by weight loss. This finding is interpreted in terms of the subdivision of brain reward circuitry along functional and anatomical lines. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Over the last decade, identification of mutations in genes predisposing to these disorders has provided the means to better understand their pathogenesis. The discovery 13 years ago of SOD1 mutations linked to ALS, which account for less than 2% of total cases, had a major impact in the field. However, despite intensive research effort, the pathways leading to the specific motor neurons degeneration in the presence of SOD1 mutations have not been fully identified.

Of paramount importance is ridding cells of mutant or post-translationally modified proteins that otherwise tend to aggregate into insoluble complexes and form inclusions. Such inclusions are characteristic of many neurodegenerative diseases and implicate protein misfolding and aggregation as common aspects of pathogenesis. In the most common familial form of ALS, mutations in SOD1 promote misfolding of the protein and target it for degradation by proteasomes. Although proteasomes can degrade the mutant proteins efficiently, altered solubility and aggregation of mutant SOD1 are features of the disease and occur most prominently in the most vulnerable cells and tissues. Indeed, lumbar spinal cord of mutant SOD1 transgenic mice show early reduction in their capacity for protein chaperoning and proteasome-mediated hydrolysis of substrates, and motor neurons are particularly vulnerable to aggregation of mutant SOD1. A high threshold for upregulating key pathways in response to the stress of added substrate load may contribute to this vulnerability. The broad spectrum neuroprotective capability and efficacy of some chaperone-based therapies in preclinical models makes these pathways attractive as targets for therapy in ALS, as well as other neurodegenerative diseases. A better understanding of the mechanisms governing the regulation of protein chaperones and UPS components would facilitate development of treatments that upregulate these pathways in a coordinated manner in neural tissue without long term toxicity.

However, this more desirable measure of disease-related alterations is not fully evaluated in early dementia. The study presented here is the first to report the spatial patterns of cortical thickness in the pre-clinical stages of Alzheimer's disease, namely mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Cortical thickness measurements for 34 healthy elderly, 62 MCI and 42 Alzheimer's disease subjects were made using fully automated magnetic resonance imaging-based analysis techniques in order to determine the pattern of cortical thinning as a function of disease progression. The thickness of the cortex decreased significantly when the healthy elderly brains were compared to those with MCI, mainly in the medial temporal lobe region and in some regions of the frontal and the parietal cortices. With the progression of disease from MCI to Alzheimer's disease, a general thinning of the entire cortex with significant extension into the lateral temporal lobe was found. In all cases, the results were more pronounced in the left hemisphere. In conclusion, we have shown that there is a specific pattern in the thinning of the cortical ribbon which is in agreement with the previous histological reports. These novel findings support the notion of increased isocortical involvement with the progression of disease.

Purification of the NF2 tumor suppressor protein from human erythrocytes	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF NEUROLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article							NEUROFIBROMATOSIS TYPE-2 GENE; ERM PROTEINS; MEMBRANE SKELETON; GLYCOPHORIN-C; FERM DOMAIN; MERLIN; BINDING; GROWTH; IDENTIFICATION; SCHWANNOMIN	Background: Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) is an autosomal dominant disease predisposing individuals to the risk of developing tumors of cranial and spinal nerves. The NF2 tumor suppressor protein, known as Merlin/Schwanomin, is a member of the protein 4.1 superfamily that function as links between the cytoskeleton and the plasma membrane. Methods: Upon selective extraction of membrane-associated proteins from erythrocyte plasma membrane (ghosts) using low ionic strength solution, the bulk of NF2 protein remains associated with the spectrin-actin depleted inside-out-vesicles. Western blot analysis showed a similar to 70 kDa polypeptide in the erythrocyte plasma membrane. Furthermore, quantitative removal of NF2 protein from the inside-out-vesicles was achieved using 1.0 M potassium iodide, a treatment known to remove tightly-bound peripheral membrane proteins. Results: These results suggest a novel mode of NF2 protein association with the erythrocyte membrane that is distinct from the known membrane interactions of protein 4.1. Based on these biochemical properties, several purification strategies were devised to isolate native NF2 protein from human erythrocyte ghosts. Using purified and recombinant NF2 protein as internal standards, we quantified approximately similar to 41-65,000 molecules of NF2 protein per erythrocyte. Conclusion: We provide evidence for the presence of NF2 protein in the human erythrocyte membrane. The identification of NF2 protein in the human erythrocyte membrane will make it feasible to discover novel interactions of NF2 protein utilizing powerful techniques of erythrocyte biochemistry and genetics in mammalian cells.

However, little is known regarding the signalling pathways involved in the angiogenic response to brain tumor-derived growth factors in irradiated human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMEC). The goal of this study is to assess the effect of ionizing radiation (IR) on HBMEC survival, migration and tubulogenesis. Methods: HBMEC were cultured and irradiated at sublethal single doses. Cell survival was assessed by nuclear cell counting and flow cytometry. HBMEC migration in response to brain tumor-derived growth factors (U-87 GF) and tubulogenesis were assayed using modified Boyden chambers and Matrigel, respectively. Results: We observed that single administration of 3-10 Gy IR doses only reduced cell survival by 30%. Radioresistant HBMEC overexpressed RhoA, a small GTPase protein regulating cellular adhesion and migration, and Rho-kinase (ROK), a serine-threonine protein kinase and one of RhoA's major targets. HBMEC migration was induced by vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF), but even more so in response to sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) and to U-87 GF. Following IR exposure, HBMEC basal migration increased more than two-fold, whereas the response to S1P and to U-87 GF was significantly diminished. Similarly, the inhibitor of ROK Y-27632 decreased HBMEC migration in response to S1P and U-87 GF. Overexpression of RhoA decreased tubulogenesis, an effect also observed in irradiated HBMEC. Conclusion: Our results suggest that radioresistant HBMEC migration response to tumor-secreted growth factors and tubulogenesis are altered following IR. The RhoA/ROK signalling pathway is involved in the IR-altered angiogenic functions and may represent a potential molecular target for enhancing the impact of radiotherapy on tumor-associated endothelial cells.

Several studies have reported that tau was associated with membranes. In the present study, we further characterized the interaction of tau with membranous elements by examining its distribution in subfractions enriched in either Golgi or endoplasmic reticulum membranes isolated from rat brain. A subfraction enriched with markers of the medial Golgi compartment, MG160 and mannosidase II, presented a high tau content indicating that tau was associated with these membranes. Electron microscope morphometry confirmed the enrichment of this subfraction with Golgi membranes. Double-immunogold labeling experiments conducted on this subtraction showed the direct association of tau with vesicles labeled with either an antibody directed against MG160 or TGN38. The association of tau with the Golgi membranes was further confirmed by immunoisolating Golgi membranes with an anti-tau antibody. Immunogold labeling confirmed the presence of tau on the Golgi membranes in neurons in vivo. Overexpression of human tau in primary hippocampal neurons induced the formation of large Golgi vesicles that were found in close vicinity to tau-containing microtubules. This suggested that tau could serve as a link between Golgi membranes and microtubules. Such role for tau was demonstrated in an in vitro reconstitution assay. Finally, our results showed that some tau isoforms present in the Golgi subfraction were phosphorylated at the sites recognized by the phosphorylation-dependent antibodies PHF-1 and AT-8.

Gender difference in the fatigability of muscles can be attributed to muscle mass (or strength) and associated level of vascular occlusion, substrate utilization, muscle composition, and neuromuscular activation patterns. The purpose of this study was to assess the role of neuromuscular activation patterns to explain gender differences in back muscle fatigability during intermittent isometric tasks. Methods. Sixteen males and 15 females performed maximal voluntary contractions (Strength) and a fatigue test to exhaustion (fatigue criterion = time to exhaustion), while standing in a static dynamometer measuring L5/S1 extension moment. The fatigue test consisted of repetitions of an 8-s cycle (1.5 s ramp to reach 40% of maximal voluntary contraction +5 s plateau at 40% of maximal voluntary contraction +1.5 s rest). Surface electromyography signals were collected bilaterally from 4 back muscles (multifidus at the L5 level, iliocostalis lumborum at U, and longissimus at L1 and T10). Findings. Males were stronger (P < 0.05) than females (316, SD 82 > 196, SD 25 N m) but showed significantly shorter time-to-exhaustion values (7.1, SD 5.2 < 13.0, SD 6.1 min.), the latter result being corroborated by electromyographic indices of fatigue. However, the gender effect on time to exhaustion disappeared when accounting for Strength, thus supporting the muscle mass hypothesis. Among the various electromyographic indices computed to assess neuromuscular activation patterns, the amount of alternating activity between homolateral and between contralateral muscles showed a gender effect (females > males). Interpretation. These results support the muscle mass hypothesis as well as the neuromuscular activation hypothesis to explain gender differences in back muscle fatigability. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Evoked responses were recorded to stimuli consisting of a control sound (1000 ms) immediately followed by a test sound (150 ms). On half of the trials, the control sound was a noise and the test sound a vowel; to control for unavoidable effects of spectral change at the transition, the roles of the stimuli were reversed on the other half of the trials. The acoustical properties of the vowel and noise sounds were carefully matched to isolate the response specific to phonological processing. As the unspecific response to sound energy onset has subsided by the transition to the test sound, we hypothesized that the transition response from a noise to a vowel would reveal vowel-specific processing. Contrary to this expectation, however, the most striking difference between vowel and noise processing was a large, vertex-negative sustained response to the vowel control sound, which had a fast onset (30-50 ms) and remained constant throughout presentation of the vowel. The vowel-specific response was isolated using a subtraction technique analogous to that commonly applied in neuroimaging studies. This similarity in analysis methodology enabled close comparison of the EEG data collected in the present study with relevant functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) literature. Dipole source analysis revealed the vowel-specific component to be located anterior and inferior to primary auditory cortex, consistent with previous data investigating speech processing with fMRI.

Indeed, in the rodent brain, abundant NT-containing fibres are found in DA-rich areas such as the ventral tegmental area and substantia nigra. Moreover, it has been shown in vivo that NT, acting through its high-affinity receptor (NTS1), reduces the physiological and behavioural effects of DA D2 receptor (D2R) activation, a critical autoreceptor feedback system regulating DA neurotransmission. However, the mechanism of this interaction is still elusive. The aim of our study was thus to reproduce in vitro the interaction between D2R and NTS1, and then to characterize the mechanisms implicated. We used a primary culture model of DA neurons prepared from transgenic mice expressing green fluorescent protein under the control of the tyrosine hydroxylase promoter. In these cultures, DA neurons endogenously express both D2R and NTS1. Using electrophysiological recordings, we show that activation of D2R directly inhibits the firing rate of DA neurons. In addition, we find that NT, acting through a NTS1-like receptor, is able to reduce D2R autoreceptor function independently of its ability to enhance DA neuron firing, and that this interaction occurs through a protein kinase C- and Ca2+-dependent mechanism. Furthermore, prior activation of D2R reduces the ability of NTS1 to induce intracellular Ca2+ mobilization. Our findings provide evidence for bidirectional interaction between D2R and NTS1 in DA neurons, a regulatory mechanism that could play a key role in the control of the activity of these neurons.

Residual abilities to respond to visual stimuli in the blind field without consciously experiencing them have, however, been described in cortically blind patients and are termed 'blindsight'. Although the neuronal basis of blindsight remains unknown, possible neuronal correlates have been proposed based on the nature of the residual vision observed. The most prominent but still controversial hypothesis postulates the involvement of the superior colliculi in blindsight. Here we demonstrate, using a computer-based reaction time test in a group of hemispherectomized subjects, that human 'attention-blindsight' can be measured for achromatic stimuli but disappears for stimuli that solely activate S-cones. Given that primate data have shown that the superior colliculi lacks input from S-cones, our results lend strong support to the hypothesis that 'attention-blindsight' is mediated through a collicular pathway. The contribution of a direct geniculo-extrastriate-koniocellular projection was ruled out by testing hemispherectomized subjects in whom a whole hemisphere has been removed or disconnected for the treatment of epilepsy.

Methods: We provide a descriptive and an analytic comparison of nomograms. Further, we report a set of recent PCa nomograms, in which we recorded predictor variables, number of patients used to develop each nomogram, and nomogram-specific features. Moreover, accuracy estimates and type of validation are considered. Results: Our findings suggest a demand for updated nomograms in selected fields of PCa outcomes. Moreover, an increasing number of nomograms address important end points such as prostate-specific antigen recurrence, distant metastases, or androgen-independent PCa-specific survival. Conclusion: Our results suggest that nomograms are available for many PCa-related outcomes. They represent a valid methodologic approach if correct criteria are met.

J	Van der Werf, YD; Paus, T				Van der Werf, Ysbrand D.; Paus, Tomas			The neural response to transcranial magnetic stimulation of the human motor cortex. I. Intracortical and cortico-cortical contributions	EXPERIMENTAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						primary motor cortex; dorsal premotor cortex; oscillations; excitability; plasticity	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; CEREBRAL-BLOOD-FLOW; CORTICOSPINAL EXCITABILITY; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; REPETITIVE TMS; AREAS; EEG; MOVEMENTS; PREMOTOR; ARM	We investigated the properties of the neural response to transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) applied over the human primary motor cortex. Consistent with our previous findings, single pulses of TMS induce a characteristic negative deflection at 45 ms (N45) and a transient oscillation in the beta frequency-range (15-30 Hz), as measured using electroencephalograpy (EEG). Here we show the relative specificity of the beta oscillation and the N45; both are stronger when elicited by stimulation applied over the primary motor cortex, as compared with stimulation over the dorsal premotor cortex. We also provide a quantitative analysis of the beta responses to single pulses of TMS and show that the responses are highly phaselocked to the TMS pulses within single subjects; this phaselocking is similar from subject to subject. A single pulse of TMS applied over the primary motor cortex thus appears to reset the ongoing oscillations of the neurons, bringing them transiently into synchrony. Finally, we examine the effect of local or distal modulation of the excitability of the primary motor cortex on the beta oscillation and the N45 in response to single-pulse TMS. We applied low-frequency subthreshold repetitive TMS either over the primary motor cortex (local modulation) or, on a separate day, over the dorsal premotor cortex (distal modulation). The modulation was evaluated with single suprathreshold test pulses of TMS applied over the primary motor cortex before and after the subthreshold low-frequency rTMS. We recorded the EEG response throughout the testing session, i.e. to both the subthreshold and the suprathreshold pulses. After repetitive TMS applied over the primary motor cortex, but not the dorsal premotor cortex, the amplitude of the N45 in response to suprathreshold pulses tended to decrease (not significant), and subsequently increased (significant); neither type of repetitive TMS affected the amplitude of the beta oscillation. We conclude that (1) the N45 depends on circuits intrinsic to the primary motor cortex; (2) the beta oscillation is specific to stimulation of the primary motor cortex, but is not affected by modulation of either cortical area and; (3) the beta oscillatory response to pulses of TMS arises from resetting of ongoing oscillations rather than their induction.

Thalamocortical contributions	EXPERIMENTAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						primary motor cortex; oscillations; excitability; plasticity; Parkinson's disease	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; CEREBRAL-BLOOD-FLOW; HUMAN BASAL GANGLIA; HUMAN SUBTHALAMIC NUCLEUS; DEEP BRAIN-STIMULATION; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; BETA-DESYNCHRONIZATION; MOVEMENT; OSCILLATIONS; MODULATION	Beta oscillations (15-30 Hz) constitute an important electrophysiological signal recorded in the resting state over the human precentral gyrus. The brain circuitry involved in generating the beta oscillations is not well understood but appears to involve both cortical and subcortical structures. We have shown that single pulses of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) applied over the primary motor cortex consistently elicit a brief beta oscillation. Reducing the local cortical excitability using low-frequency repetitive TMS does not change the amplitude of the induced beta oscillation (Van Der Werf and Paus in Exp Brain Res DOI 10.1007/s00221-006-0551-2). Here, we investigated the possible involvement of the thalamus in the cortically expressed beta response to single-pulse TMS. We included eight patients with Parkinson's disease who had undergone unilateral surgical lesioning of the ventrolateral nucleus of the thalamus. We administered 50 single pulses of TMS, at an intensity of 120% of resting motor threshold, over the left and right primary motor cortex and, at the same time, recorded the electroencephalogram (EEG) using a 60-electrode cap. We were able to perform analyses on seven EEG data sets and found that stimulation of the unoperated hemisphere (with thalamus) resulted in higher amplitudes of the single-trial induced beta oscillations than in the operated hemisphere (with thalamotomy). The beta oscillation obtained in response to pulses applied over the unoperated hemisphere was also higher than that obtained in healthy controls. We suggest that (1) the beta oscillatory response to pulses of TMS applied over the primary motor cortex is higher in Parkinson's disease patients, (2) thalamotomy serves to reduce the abnormally high TMS-induced beta oscillations, and (3) the motor thalamus facilitates the cortically generated oscillation, through cortico-subcortico-cortical feedback loops.

J	Ouellette, BG; Casanova, C				Ouellette, Brian G.; Casanova, Christian			Overlapping visual response latency distributions in visual cortices and LP-pulvinar complex of the cat	EXPERIMENTAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article							LATERAL POSTERIOR NUCLEUS; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; CONNECTIONAL ORGANIZATION; TEMPORAL INTEGRATION; MOTION INTEGRATION; LAMINAR ORIGINS; THALAMIC NUCLEI; MACAQUE MONKEY; RHESUS-MONKEY; AREAS V1	The visual system of the cat is considered to be organized in both a serial and parallel manner. Studies of visual onset latencies generally suggest that parallel processing occurs throughout the dorsal stream. These studies are at odds with the proposed hierarchies of visual areas based on termination patterns of cortico-cortical projections. In previous studies, a variety of stimuli have been used to compute latencies, and this is problematic as latencies are known to depend on stimulus parameters. This could explain the discrepancy between latency and neuroanatomical based studies. Therefore, the first aim of the present study was to determine whether latencies increased along the hierarchy of visual areas when the same stimuli are used. In addition, the effect of stimulus complexity was assessed. Visual onset latencies were calculated for area 17, PMLS, AMLS, and AEV neurons. Latencies were also computed from neurons in the lateral posterior (LP)-pulvinar complex given the importance of this extrageniculate complex in cortical intercommunication. Latency distributions from all regions overlapped substantially, and no significant difference was present, regardless of the type of stimulus used. The onset latencies in the LP-pulvinar complex were comparable to those seen in cortical areas. The data suggest that the initial processing of information in the visual system is parallel, despite the presence of a neuroanatomical hierarchy. Simultaneous response onsets among cortical areas and the LP-pulvinar suggest that the latter is more than a simple relay station for information headed to cortex. The data are consistent with proposals of the LP-pulvinar as a center for the integration and distribution of information from/to multiple cortical areas.

Dynamics of the horizontal vestibuloocular reflex after unilateral labyrinthectomy: response to high frequency, high acceleration, and high velocity rotations	EXPERIMENTAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						VOR; unilateral labyrinthectomy; high frequency; high acceleration; high velocity	MEDIAL VESTIBULAR NUCLEUS; VISUAL FOLLOWING MECHANISMS; LONG-TERM MODIFICATIONS; PASSIVE HEAD MOVEMENTS; CANAL RELATED ACTIVITY; ALERT GUINEA-PIG; SQUIRREL-MONKEY; OCULAR REFLEX; CERVICOOCULAR REFLEX; NEURONAL-ACTIVITY	Loss of vestibular information from one labyrinth results in a marked asymmetry in the horizontal vestibuloocular reflex (VOR). The results of prior studies suggest that long-term deficits in VOR are more severe in response to rapid impulses than to sinusoidal head movements. The goal of the present study was to investigate the VOR following unilateral labyrinthectomy in response to different stimuli covering the full range of physiologically relevant head movements in macaque monkeys. The VOR was studied 1-39 days post-lesion using transient head perturbations (up to 12,000 degrees/s(2)), rapid rotations (up to 500 degrees/s), and sinusoidal rotations (up to 15 Hz). In response to rotations with high acceleration or velocity, both contra- and ipsilesional gains remained subnormal. VOR gains decreased as a function of increasing stimulus acceleration or velocity, reaching minimal values of 0.7-0.8 and 0.3-0.4 for contra and ipsilesional rotations, respectively. For sinusoidal rotations with low frequencies and velocities, responses to contralesional stimulation recovered within -4 days. With increasing velocities and frequencies of rotation, however, the gains of contra- and ipsilesional responses remained subnormal. For each of the most challenging stimuli tested (i.e., 12,000 degrees/s(2) supercript stoptransient head perturbations, 500 degrees/s fast whole-body rotations and 15 Hz stimulation) no significant compensation was observed in contra- or ipsilesional responses over time. Moreover, we found that gain of the cervico-ocular reflex (COR) remained negligible following unilateral loss indicating that neck reflexes did not contribute to the observed compensation. VOR responses elicited by both sinusoidal and transient rotations following unilateral labyrinthectomy could be described by the same mathematical model. We conclude that the compensated VOR has comparable response dynamics for impulses and sinusoidal head movements.

Methods: A search of the MEDLINE, CINAHL, and PsycINFO databases was conducted in June 2006 to identify studies that used a standardized interview or validated questionnaire to assess depression. The search was augmented by hand searching of selected journals and references of identified articles and reviews. Results: Major depression was identified in 4% to 10% of adult patients using structured interviews in hospital and in the year following discharge. The prevalence of significant depressive symptoms in studies that used the depression subscale of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale post discharge was 4% to 13%, whereas studies that used the Beck Depression Inventory generally produced substantially higher rates: between 13% and 26% for "moderate to severe" symptoms and between 22% and 54% for at least "mild" symptoms. Conclusions: The general low quality of studies reviewed suggests the need for future studies using larger sample sizes to adequately assess prevalence rates and risk factors. No existing studies have addressed the persistence of depression in burn survivors; there are no treatment studies; and there are no recent studies of children. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

A DTMOS transistor is a device whose gate is tied to its bulk. DTMOS transistor pseudo-pMOS differential input pairs are used for input common-mode range enhancement, followed by a single ended class-AB output. Two versions of the proposed opamp (opamp-A and opamp-B) were fabricated in a standard 0.18-mu m CMOS process technology. Measurements under 5 pF and 10 k Omega load conditions gave, for opamp-A, a DC open-loop gain of 50.1 dB, and a unity gain bandwidth (GBW) of 26.2 MHz. A common-mode rejection ratio (CMRR) of 78 dB, and input and output swings of 0.7 V and 0.9 V, respectively, were achieved. Opamp-B has been optimized for biomedical applications, and is implemented to build the analog front-end part of a near-infrared spectroreflectometry (NIRS) receiver of a multi-wavelength wireless brain oxymeter apparatus. A DC open-loop gain of 53 dB, a GBW of 1.3 MHZ, and input and output swings of 0.6 V and 0.8 V, respectively, were measured. Opamp-A consumes 550 mu W with an input referred noise of 160 nV/root Hz at 1 kHz. Opamp-B consumes only 40 mu W and exhibits a lower input referred noise of 107 nV/root Hz at 1 kHz.

Louis			Twenty new digital brain phantoms for creation of validation image data bases	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MEDICAL IMAGING			English	Article						brain; digital phantom; magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); simulation; validation	MAGNETIC-RESONANCE IMAGES; INTENSITY NONUNIFORMITY; MRI; CLASSIFICATION; VOLUMES	Simulations provide a way of generating data where ground truth is known, enabling quantitative testing of image processing methods. In this paper, we present the construction of 20 realistic digital brain phantoms that can be used to simulate medical imaging data. The phantoms are made from 20 normal adults to take into account intersubject anatomical variabilities. Each digital brain phantom was created by registering and averaging four T1, T2, and proton density (PD)-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans from each subject. A fuzzy minimum distance classification was used to classify voxel intensities from T1, T2, and PD average volumes into grey-matter, white matter, cerebro-spinal fluid, and fat. Automatically generated mask volumes were required to separate brain from nonbrain structures and ten fuzzy tissue volumes were created: grey matter, white matter, cerebro-spinal fluid, skull, marrow within the bone, dura, fat, tissue around the fat, muscles, and skin/muscles. A fuzzy vessel class was also obtained from the segmentation of the magnetic resonance angiography scan of the subject. These eleven fuzzy volumes that describe the spatial distribution of anatomical tissues define the digital phantom, where voxel intensity is proportional to the fraction of tissue within the voxel. These fuzzy volumes can be used to drive simulators for different modalities including MRI, PET, or SPECT. These phantoms were used to construct 20 simulated T1-weighted MR scans. To evaluate the realism of these simulations, we propose two approaches to compare them to real data acquired with the same acquisition parameters. The first approach consists of comparing the intensities within the segmented classes in both real and simulated data. In the second approach, a whole brain voxel-wise comparison between simulations and real T1-weighted data is performed. The first comparison underlines that segmented classes appear to properly represent the anatomy on average, and that inside these classes, the simulated and real intensity values are quite similar. The second comparison enables the study of the regional variations with no a priori class. The experiments demonstrate that these variations are small when real data are corrected for intensity nommiformity.

Mapping canonical Wnt signaling in the developing and adult retina	INVESTIGATIVE OPHTHALMOLOGY & VISUAL SCIENCE			English	Article							F-BOX PROTEIN; BETA-CATENIN; SONIC-HEDGEHOG; GENE-EXPRESSION; GANGLION-CELLS; HOMEOBOX GENE; MOUSE RETINA; VERTEBRATE DEVELOPMENT; TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR; MOLECULAR-MECHANISM	PURPOSE. The role of the Wnt[b]/beta-catenin-dependent pathway (canonical Wnt pathway) in the context of retinal development and homeostasis is largely unknown. This study was undertaken to characterize activation of the Wnt canonical pathway and its relevance to cell type populations in the developing and adult retina. METHODS. Tissue from TCF/Lef-LacZ (T-cell-specific transcription factor/lymphoid enhancer-binding factor) transgenic mice was used for monitoring the activation of the canonical Wnt pathway. Lithium (Li+) treatment was applied to induce ectopic activation of the TCF/Lef-LacZ reporter gene in retinal explants. Gene expression and retinal cell types were examined by in situ hybridization ( ISH) or by immunohistochemistry (IHC). RESULTS. On Li+ treatment, ectopic expression of the wTCF/Lef-LacZ reporter gene was rapidly and dramatically induced in retinal explants. The pattern of TCF/Lef-LacZ reporter gene expression was dynamic throughout retinal development and in the adult retina. There was a distinctive expression pattern in each cellular layer, in the developing ciliary margin (CM), and the prospective ciliary epithelium. In the mature retina, the TCF/Lef-LacZ reporter gene was expressed in subsets of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and amacrine cells. The expression of the four TCF/Lef transcription factors overlapped with activation of the TCF/Lef-LacZ reporter. CONCLUSIONS. The TCF/Lef-LacZ transgene is a faithful reporter of canonical Wnt signaling in the retina. The pattern of TCF/Lef-LacZ reporter gene activation and of TCF/Lef transcription factor expression suggests that activation of the canonical Wnt pathway is developmental-stage dependent and is spatially modulated. Our findings also imply the involvement of this pathway in the specification and/or generation of ciliary epithelium, cellular differentiation, axon guidance, and connectivity to targets in the central nervous system and in the maintenance or function of specific retinal neurons in the adult.

Quantitative spatial comparison of diffuse optical imaging with blood oxygen level-dependent and arterial spin labeling-based functional magnetic resonance imaging	JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL OPTICS			English	Article						near infrared; multimodality imaging; image reconstruction; magnetic resonance imaging	NEAR-INFRARED SPECTROSCOPY; BRAIN ACTIVATION; CEREBRAL-BLOOD; BOLD SIGNAL; IN-VIVO; FOREPAW STIMULATION; LIGHT-PROPAGATION; RESPONSE FUNCTION; BALLOON MODEL; FMRI	Akin to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), diffuse optical imaging (DOI) is a noninvasive method for measuring localized changes in hemoglobin levels within the brain. When combined with fMRI methods, multimodality approaches could offer an integrated perspective on the biophysics, anatomy, and physiology underlying each of the imaging modalities. Vital to the correct interpretation of such studies, control experiments to test the consistency of both modalities must be performed. Here, we compare DOI with blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) and arterial spin labeling fMRI-based methods in order to explore the spatial agreement of the response amplitudes recorded by these two methods. Rather than creating optical images by regularized, tomographic reconstructions, we project the fMRI image into optical measurement space using the optical forward problem. We report statistically better spatial correlation between the fMRI-BOLD response and the optically measured deoxyhemoglobin (R = 0.71, p = 1 X 10(-7)) than between the BOLD and oxyhemoglobin or total hemoglobin measures (R = 0.38, p = 0.04 vertical bar 0.37, p = 0.05, respectively). Similarly, we find that the correlation between the ASL measured blood flow and optically measured total and oxyhemoglobin is stronger (R = 0.73, p = 5 X 10(-6) and R = 0.71, p = 9 X 10(-6), respectively) than the flow to deoxyhemoglobin spatial correlation (R = 0.26, p = 0.10).

Participants: Three hundred thirty-nine patients with traumatic brain injury (239 mild, 48 moderate, 52 severe). Setting: Level I trauma center. Main Measures: Predictor variables considered were age, education, Glasgow Coma Scale score, duration of posttraumatic amnesia, cerebral imaging results, and need for neurosurgical intervention. Outcome measures were Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale and discharge destination. Results: Logistic regressions showed that a shorter posttraumatic amnesia decreased the probability of moderate to severe disability. Moreover, discharge home was less probable for patients with positive cerebral imaging. Conclusion: This model can help predict rehabilitation needs upon discharge from an acute care hospital.

Urinary iP levels have been used as indices of in vivo lipid peroxidation. Thus far, it has only been possible to measure iPs derived from arachidonic acid in urine, because levels of iPs/neuroprostanes (nPs) derived from omega 3-PUFAs have been found to be below detection limits of available assays. Because of the interest in omega 3-PUFA dietary supplementation, we developed specific methods to measure nPF(4 alpha)-VI and iPF(3 alpha)-VI [derived from 4,7,10,13,16,19-docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and 5,8,11,14,17-eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)] using a combination of chemical synthesis, gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS), and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS). Although nPF(4 alpha)-VI was below the detection limit of the assay, we conclusively identified iPF(3 alpha)-VI in human urine by GC/MS and LC/MS/MS. The mean levels in 26 subjects were similar to 300 pg/mg creatinine. Our failure to detect nPF(4 alpha)-VI may have been due to its rapid metabolism by beta-oxidation to iPF(3 alpha)-VI, which we showed to occur in rat liver homogenates. In contrast, iPF(3 alpha)-VI is highly resistant to beta- oxidation in vitro. Thus iPF(3 alpha)-VI can be formed by two mechanisms: i) direct autoxidation of EPA, and ii) b- oxidation of nPF(4 alpha)-VI, formed by autoxidation of DHA. This iP may therefore serve as an excellent marker for the combined in vivo peroxidation of EPA and DHA.

Materials and Methods: Eight patients with TL EEG spikes underwent an EEG-fMRI scanning session using z-shimming. The signal intensities in the z-shimmed images were compared with those in the standard images. BOLD activation maps were created from the two sets of images using the timings of the spikes observed on the EEG. Results: The mean signal increase in the TLs as a result of z-shimming was 45.9% +/- 4.5%. The percentage of TL voxels above a brain intensity threshold rose from 66.1% +/- 7.6% to 77.6% +/- 5.7%. This appreciable increase in signal did not lead to any significant differences in the statistical maps created with the two sets of functional images. Conclusion: The results suggest that loss of signal is not the limiting factor for the detection of spike-related BOLD signal changes in patients with TLE activity.

The relative contributions of these processes, sources and extent of membrane reserves are not well defined. In this study, the SA and V of single substrate-attached A549, 16HBE14o(-), CHO and NIH 3T3 cells were evaluated by reconstructing cell three-dimensional topology based on conventional light microscopic images acquired simultaneously from two perpendicular directions. The size of SA reserves was determined by swelling cells in extreme 98% hypotonic (similar to 6 mOsm) solution until membrane rupture; all cell types examined demonstrated surprisingly large membrane reserves and could increase their SA 3.6 +/- 0.2-fold and V 10.7 +/- 1.5-fold. Blocking exocytosis (by N-ethylmaleimide or 10 degrees) reduced SA and V increases of A549 cells to 1.7 +/- 0.3-fold and 4.4 +/- 0.9-fold, respectively. Interestingly, blocking exocytosis did not a. ect SA and V changes during moderate swelling in 50% hypotonicity. Thus, mammalian cells accommodate moderate (< 2-fold) V increases mainly by shape changes and by drawing membrane from preexisting surface reserves, while significant endomembrane insertion is observed only during extreme swelling. Large membrane reserves may provide a simple mechanism to maintain membrane tension below the lytic level during various cellular processes or acute mechanical perturbations and may explain the difficulty in activating mechanogated channels in mammalian cells.

Brief sojourns to subconductance levels were occasionally observed within prolonged ("persistent") burst openings. Subconductance occurrence and amplitude were determined following two distinct, complementary approaches: (1) direct visual inspection and (2) automated detection by application of a method that exploits the current variance of fixed-width tracing segments to sort amplitude estimations. The two approaches led to comparable results. At least six subconductance levels in addition to the full open state were revealed, with amplitudes that were approximately 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60% and 75% that of full openings. The global probability of subconductance opening occurrence within a burst as well as the probability of observing one particular subconductance level within a burst showed no clear dependence upon membrane potential in the -40 to +10 mV range. Open- and closed-time distributions of substate openings could either be similar to those observed in burst full openings or show distinct patterns. Low-amplitude late openings were also observed in isolation, separately from full-size openings. These openings corresponded to conductance levels very similar to those of the substates observed within full-size burst openings; therefore, they were interpreted as isolated subconductance openings. Early, transient openings responsible for the fast-inactivating whole-cell Na+-current component also manifested distinct conductance levels, the two most prominent of which were in an approximate 75 : 100 amplitude ratio. Interestingly, the 75% conductance level observed among early openings occurred much more frequently than in "persistent" burst openings. We conclude that pharmacologically untreated Na+ channels from native neurons generate substate openings that may influence differently the multiple gating modes displayed by these channels.

However, the contribution of low dose IR-induced non-apoptotic cell death pathways has not been investigated. This study aimed to characterize the effect of IR on human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMEC) and to assess the combined effect of epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCg), a green tea-derived anti-angiogenic molecule. HBMEC were treated with EGCg, irradiated with a sublethal (<= 10 Gy) single dose. Cell survival was assessed 48 h later by nuclear cell counting and Trypan blue exclusion methods. Cell cycle distribution and DNA fragmentation were evaluated by flow cytometry (FC), cell death was assessed by fluorimetric caspase-3 activity, FC and immunoblotting for pro-apoptotic proteins. While low IR doses alone reduced cell survival by 30%, IR treatment was found more effective in EGCg pretreated-cells reaching 70% cell death. Analysis of cell cycle revealed that IR-induced cell accumulation in G2-phase. Expression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p21(CIP/Waf1) and p27(Kip) were increased by EGCg and IR. Although random DNA fragmentation increased by approximately 40% following combined EGCg/IR treatments, the synergistic reduction of cell survival was not related to increased pro-apoptotic caspase-3, caspase-9 and cytochrome C proteins. Cell necrosis increased 5-fold following combined EGCg/IR treatments while no changes in early or late apoptosis were observed. Our results suggest that the synergistic effects of combined EGCg/IR treatments may be related to necrosis, a non-apoptotic cell death pathway. Strategies sensitizing brain tumor-derived EC to IR may enhance the efficacy of radiotherapy and EGCg may represent such a potential agent.

The earliest and perhaps still most consistent abnormal immunologic laboratory finding in MS is the increased concentration of Ig in the CSF, representing intrathecal antibody synthesis. Analysis of CSF Ig in terms of rate of production and restricted diversity (oligoclonal bands) remains a supportive diagnostic criteria for MS. Despite large-scale studies such as the analysis of 1000 cases reported by Ebers and Paty [Ebers, G.C., Paty, D.W., 1980. CSF electrophoresis in one thousand patients. Can. J. Neurol. Sci. 7 (4) 275-280], the challenge of correlating CSF Ig profiles and specific disease phenotypes remains. More recently, evidence from animal models and several human studies suggests that antibody-independent functions of B cells may also be implicated in the pathogenesis of MS. This presentation considers what roles Ig and/or B cells can play in mediating or regulating disease-relevant immune responses in MS. A timely corollary is whether B cell/Ig-directed therapeutic strategies can be effective in MS. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The aim of this study was to further characterize the profile of cognitive impairment and the neuroanatomical basis of Rtv-FTLD patients without behavioural disturbances. A group of three patients with this syndrome had a detailed neuropsychological assessment, along with Voxel-Based Morphometry (VBM) of their brain to determine location of cortical atrophy. VBM analyses showed a pattern of atrophy that was predominant in the right hemisphere and concerned primarily the right anterior temporal lobe region. Patients carried out a test of famous people in which their ability to recognize, name and provide semantic information about famous persons from their faces, their voices and their names was investigated. They all showed a severe defect in recognizing, naming and identifying famous people irrespective of modality. Therefore, their inability to recognize famous people resulted from a multimodal defect (semantic). These results highlight the semantic nature of the defect, and suggest that the anterior right temporal lobe may have a prominent role in processing person-based semantic knowledge. This study helps in further understanding the neuropsychological profile of patients with Rtv-FTLD.

Cerebral degeneration predicts survival in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis	JOURNAL OF NEUROLOGY NEUROSURGERY AND PSYCHIATRY			English	Article							MAGNETIC-RESONANCE SPECTROSCOPY; MOTOR-NEURON DISEASE; H-1 MRSI; IN-VIVO; ALS; POPULATION; PROGRESSION; CORTEX	Objective: To determine the relationship of cerebral degeneration with survival in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Methods: Patients with probable or definite ALS underwent magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) of the brain between July 1996 and May 2002, and were followed prospectively until March 2004. Creatine (Cr), choline (Cho) and the neuronal marker N-acetylaspartate (NAA) were quantified as ratios in the motor cortex. Results: In 63 patients compared with 18 healthy people, NAA/Cho was reduced by 13% (p < 0.001), NAA/Cr was reduced by 5% (p = 0.01) and Cho/Cr was increased by 8% (p = 0.01). NAA/Cho was used for survival analysis, given its larger effect size and superior test accuracy (a sensitivity of 67% and a specificity of 83%). Median survival after MRSI was 24 months. Multivariate analysis showed reduced survival for lower NAA/Cho (hazard ratio (HR) 0.24, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.08 to 0.72, p = 0.01), older age (HR 1.03, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.06, p = 0.04) and shorter symptom duration (HR 0.96, 95% CI 0.93 to 0.99, p = 0.01). Patients with NAA/Cho < 2.11 had a reduced survival of 19.4 v 31.9 months (HR 2.05, 95% CI 1.12 to 4.03, p = 0.02). Conclusions: Cerebral degeneration is predictive of reduced survival in ALS.

J	Schepens, B; Drew, T				Schepens, Benedicte; Drew, Trevor			Descending signals from the pontomedullary reticular formation are bilateral, asymmetric, and gated during reaching movements in the cat	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article							INTACT UNANESTHETIZED CAT; PRIMATE CORTICOMOTONEURONAL CELLS; PONTINE RETICULOSPINAL AXONS; GENERALIZED MOTOR INHIBITION; VOLUNTARY GAIT MODIFICATIONS; FUNCTIONAL-ORGANIZATION; DISCHARGE PATTERNS; PHA-L; CORTICORETICULAR PATHWAYS; POSTURAL ADJUSTMENT	We examined the contribution of neurons within the pontomedullary reticular formation (PMRF) to the control of reaching movements in the cat. We recorded the activity of 127 reticular neurons, including 56 reticulospinal neurons, during movements of each forelimb; 67/127 of these neurons discharged prior to the onset of activity in the prime flexor muscles during the reach of the ipsilateral limb and form the focus of this report. Most neurons (63/67) showed similar patterns and levels of discharge activity during reaches of either limb, although activity was slightly greater during reach of the ipsilateral limb. In 26/67 cells, the initial change in discharge activity was time-locked to the GO signal during reaches of either limb; we have argued that this early discharge contributes to the anticipatory postural adjustments that precede movement. In 11/26 cells, the initial change in activity was reciprocal for reaches with the left and right limbs, although activity during the movement was nonreciprocal. Spike-triggered averaging produced postspike facilitation or depression (PSD) in 12/50 cells during reaches of the limb ipsilateral to the recording site and in 17/49 cells during reach of the contralateral limb. Some cells produced PSD in ipsilateral extensor muscles before the start of the reach and during reaches made with the contralateral, but not the ipsilateral limb; this suggests the signal must be differentially gated. Overall, the results suggest a strong bilateral, albeit asymmetric, contribution from the PMRF to the control of posture and movement during voluntary movement.

In this paper, we used whole cell patch recordings in brain stem slices of young rats to show that these neurons have intrinsic bursting abilities that persist in absence of extracellular Ca2+. Application of different K+ channel blockers affected duration and firing rate of bursts, but left bursting ability intact. Bursting was voltage dependent and was abolished by low concentrations of Na+ channel blockers. The proportion of bursting neurons increased dramatically in the second postnatal week, in parallel with profound changes in several electrophysiological properties. This is the period in which masticatory movements appear and mature. Bursting was associated with the development of an afterdepolarization that depend on maturation of a persistent sodium conductance (I-NaP). An interesting finding was that the occurrence of bursting and the magnitude of I-NaP were both modulated by the extracellular concentration of Ca2+. Lowering extracellular [Ca2+] increased both I-NaP and probability of bursting. We suggest that these mechanisms underlie burst generation in mastication and that similar processes may be found in other motor pattern generators.

Depletion of glutathione induces 4-hydroxynonenal protein adducts and hydroxyurea teratogenicity in the organogenesis stage mouse embryo	JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY AND EXPERIMENTAL THERAPEUTICS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	45th Annual Meeting of the Teratology-Society	JUN 25-30, 2005	St Pete Beach, FL	Teratol Soc			DNA-BINDING ACTIVITY; BUTHIONINE SULFOXIMINE; CHEMICAL TERATOGENESIS; OXIDATIVE STRESS; VITAMIN-E; AP-1; ACTIVATION; LIMB; GLUCOSE-6-PHOSPHATE-DEHYDROGENASE; EMBRYOTOXICITY	Glutathione (GSH) homeostasis is important during organogenesis. To elucidate the impact of GSH depletion in organogenesis stage embryos on oxidative stress and drug teratogenicity, L-buthionine-S, R-sulfoximine (BSO) was given to timed pregnant CD-1 mice 4 h before exposure to a model teratogen, hydroxyurea (HU) [400 mg/kg (HU-400) or 600 mg/kg (HU600)]. Treatment with BSO or HU alone or with BSO plus HU-400 did not alter the ratios of glutathione disulfide/GSH in the embryo; in contrast, the combination of BSO plus HU-600 did increase this ratio at both 0.5 and 3 h post-HU, indicating the induction of oxidative stress in the embryos. Immunoreactivity to a product of lipid peroxidation, 4-hydroxynonenal (4HNE) protein adducts, was detected in saline-treated embryos; the intensity and nuclear localization of 4-HNE protein adduct immunoreactivity in specific regions in the embryo was significantly increased by exposure to BSO alone or BSO and either dose of HU. BSO pretreatment increased the spectrum and incidence of external and skeletal malformations (curly tail, hind limb malformations, hydrocephaly, exencephaly, open eye, spina bifida, and gastroschisis) induced by HU-400 and HU-600; BSO exposure did not alter the effects of HU on fetal mortality or fetal weights or HU induction of c-Fos heterodimer-dependent activator protein 1 DNA binding activity. The formation of 4-HNE protein adducts in teratogen-exposed embryos was localized to regions of the embryo that were highly susceptible to insult, namely the somites and caudal neural tube, correlating the presence of 4-HNE adducts with the disruption of pattern formation during organogenesis.

Pigs have been used for antiarrhythmic drug testing, but only sparse data exist regarding porcine atrial ionic electrophysiology. Here, we used electrophysiological, molecular, and pharmacological tools to characterize a prominent porcine outward K+ current (I-K,I-PO) in atrial cardiomyocytes isolated from adult pigs. I-K,I-PO activated rapidly (time to peak at +60 mV; 2.1 +/- 0.2 ms), inactivated slowly (tau(f) = 45 +/- 10; tau(s) = 215 +/- 28 ms), and showed very slow recovery (tau(f) = 1.54 +/- 0.73 s; tau(s) = 7.91 +/- 1.78 s; n = 9; 36 degrees C). Activation and inactivation were voltage-dependent, and current properties were consistent with predominant K+ conductance. Neurotoxins (heteropodatoxin, hongatoxin, and blood depressing substance) that block K(v)4.x, K(v)1.1, -1.2, -1.3, and -3.4 in a highly selective manner as well as H2O2 and tetraethylammonium, did not affect the current. Drugs with K(v)1.5-blocking properties (flecainide, perhexiline, and the novel atrial-selective antiarrhythmic 2'-{2-(4-methoxyphenyl)-acetylamino-methyl}-biphenyl-2-carboxylic acid (2-pyridin-3-yl-ethyl)-amide; AVE0118) inhibited I-K,I-PO (IC50 of 132 +/- 47, 17 +/- 10, and 1.25 +/- 0.62 mu M, respectively). 4-Aminopyridine suppressed the current and accelerated its decay, reducing charge carriage with an IC50 of 39 +/- 15 mu M. Porcine-specific K-v channel subunit sequences were cloned to permit real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction on RNA extracted from isolated cardiomyocytes, which showed much greater abundance of K(v)1.5 mRNA compared with K(v)1.4, K(v)4.2, and K(v)4.3. Action potential recordings showed that I-K,I-PO inhibition with 0.1 mM 4-AP delayed repolarization (e.g., action potential duration at -50 mV increased from 45 +/- 9 to 69 +/- 5 ms at 3 Hz; P < 0.05). In conclusion, porcine atrium displays a current that is involved in repolarization, inactivates more slowly than classic transient outward current, is associated with strong K(v)1.5 expression, and shows a pharmacological profile typical of K(v)1.5-dependent currents.

J	Ferreri, F; Agbokou, C; Gauthier, S				Ferreri, Florian; Agbokou, Catherine; Gauthier, Serge			Cognitive dysfunctions in schizophrenia: potential benefits of cholinesterase inhibitor adjunctive therapy	JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY & NEUROSCIENCE			English	Review						cholinesterase inhibitor; cognition; dementia; donepezil; schizophrenia	PLACEBO-CONTROLLED TRIAL; RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIAL; MINI-MENTAL-STATE; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; DOUBLE-BLIND; ACETYLCHOLINE-RECEPTOR; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; RATING-SCALE; BRAIN-TISSUE; DONEPEZIL	Objective: In schizophrenia, cognitive dysfunctions commonly affect attention, memory and executive function, interfere with functional outcome and remain difficult to treat. Previous studies have implicated the cholinergic system in cognitive functioning. In Alzheimer's disease, cholinergic agonists have shown modest clinical benefits on cognitive and behavioural symptoms. Impaired cholinergic activity might also be involved in schizophrenia. Hence the role of cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEI) as adjunctive therapy is under study. We aimed to review the literature and evaluate the overall effectiveness of ChEI adjunctive therapy for the management of cognitive dysfunctions in schizophrenia. Methods: We conducted a computer-based search using PubMed (up to February 15, 2006) and ISI Web of Science (conference proceeding abstracts from January 2003 to December 2005) databases. We used the search terms "schizophrenia," "cognition or memory" and "tacrine or donepezil or rivastigmine or galantamine." Studies included were critically analyzed for allocation, blindness, duration and study design, demographic data, and clinical and neuropsychological outcome assessments. We excluded studies that involved patients with psychiatric disorders other than schizophrenia-spectrum or if they involved animals or molecular investigations. We also excluded conference proceeding abstracts with no explicit neuropsychological battery and/or results. Results: Data on ChEI as adjunctive therapy for the cognitive impairments in schizophrenia are sparse and so far derived from small samples and mostly open uncontrolled studies. ChEI's potential in long-term management has barely been documented and remains to be fully explored. Conclusion: There is insufficient evidence on whether ChEI should be used for the treatment of cognitive dysfunctions in schizophrenia. Nevertheless, further studies with appropriate trial designs and outcome measures in homogenous schizophrenia populations are warranted.

Serotonin increases phosphorylation of synaptic 4EBP through TOR, but eukaryotic initiation factor 4E levels do not limit somatic cap-dependent translation in Aplysia neurons	MOLECULAR AND CELLULAR BIOLOGY			English	Article							LONG-TERM FACILITATION; RAPAMYCIN-SENSITIVE MANNER; LOCAL PROTEIN-SYNTHESIS; P70 S6 KINASE; MAMMALIAN TARGET; MESSENGER-RNA; SEA-URCHIN; PHAS-I; SIGNALING PATHWAY; ORNITHINE DECARBOXYLASE	The target of rapamycin (TOR) plays an important role in memory formation in Aplysia californica. Here, we characterize one of the downstream targets of TOR, the eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) binding protein (4EBP) from Aplysia. Aplysia 4EBP contains the four critical phosphorylation sites regulated by TOR as well as an N-terminal RAIP motif and a C-terminal TOS site. Aplysia 4EBP was hypophosphoryllated in synaptosomes, and serotonin addition caused a rapamycin-sensitive increase in 4EBP phosphorylation both in synaptosomes and in isolated neurites. Aplysia 4EBP was regulated in a fashion similar to that of mammalian 4EBPs, binding to eIF4E when dephosphorylated and releasing eIF4E after phosphorylation. Overexpression of 4EBP in the soma of Aplysia neurons caused a specific decrease in cap-dependent translation that was rescued by concomitant overexpression of eIF4E. However, eIF4E overexpression by itself did not increase cap-dependent translation, suggesting that increasing levels of free eIF4E by phosphorylating 4EBP is not important in regulating cap-dependent translation in the cell soma. Total levels of eIF4E were also regulated by 4EBP, suggesting that 4EBP can also act as an eIF4E chaperone. These studies demonstrate the conserved nature of 4EBP regulation and its role in cap-dependent translation and suggest differential roles of 4EBP phosphorylation in the soma and synapse.

In animal, fasciclin proteins participate in cell adhesion and communication. However, the molecular basis of interactions in plants is still unknown and none of these domains have been characterized in cereals. This work reports the characterization of 34 wheat (Triticum aestivum) and 24 rice (Oryza sativa) Fasciclin-Like Arabinogalactan-proteins (FLAs). Bioinformatics analyses show that cereal FLAs share structural characteristics with known Arabidopsis FLAs including arabinogalactan-protein and fasciclin conserved domains. At least 70% of the wheat and rice FLAs are predicted to be glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored to the plasma membranes. Expression analyses determined from the relative abundance of ESTs in the publicly available wheat EST databases and from RNA gel blots indicate that most of these genes are weakly expressed and found mainly in seeds and roots. Furthermore, most wheat genes were down regulated by abiotic stresses except for TaFLA9 and 12 where cold treatment induces their expression in roots. Plant fasciclin-like domains were predicted to have 3-D homology with FAS1 domain of the fasciclin I insect neural cell adhesion molecule with an estimated precision above 70%. The structural analysis shows that negatively charged amino acids are concentrated along the beta 1-alpha 3-alpha 4-beta 2 edges, while the positively charged amino acids are concentrated on the back side of the folds. This highly charged surface distribution could provide a way of mediating protein-protein interactions via electrostatic forces similar to many other adhesion molecules. The identification of wheat FLAs will facilitate studying their function in plant growth and development and their role in stress response.

The distinct and unifying aspect of these disorders is the presence of thorny deformations of circulating erythrocytes. This may be due to abnormal properties of red cell membranes, which could lead to insights into mechanisms of neurodegeneration. Research approaches in this field, in addition to examining functions and protein interactions of the affected proteins with particular respect to neurons, have also drawn upon the expertise of hematologists and red cell membrane biologists. In this article, recent developments in the field are presented.

To determine whether this neurotransmitter-specific progression persists at later pathological stages, presynaptic bouton densities, and the areas of occupation and localization of plaque adjacent dystrophic neurites were quantified in 18-month-old APP(K670N,M671L)+PS1(M146L) doubly transgenic mice. Quantification revealed that transgenic animals had significantly lower cholinergic, glutamatergic and GABAergic presynaptic bouton densities. Cholinergic and glutamatergic dystrophic neurites appear to be heavily influenced by fibrillar A beta as both types displayed a decreasing area of occupation with respect to increasing plaque size. Furthermore, cholinergic dystrophic neurites reside in closer proximity to plaques than glutamatergic dystrophic neurites, while GABAergic dystrophic neurites were minimal regardless of plaque size. To investigate whether similarities exist in the human AD pathology, a monoclonal antibody (McKA1) against the human vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (VG1uT1) was developed. Subsequent staining in AD brain tissue revealed the novel presence of glutamatergic dystrophic neurites, to our knowledge the first evidence of a structural glutamatergic deficit in the AD pathology.

Plasmid encoding a constitutively active form of Hsf1, HSf1(act) and chemicals shown to activate Hsf1 in other cells were investigated in a primary culture model of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Hsf1(act) and the Hsp90 inhibitor, geldanamycin, induced high expression of multiple Hsps in cultured motor neurons and conferred dramatic neuroprotection against SOD1(G93A) in comparison to Hsp70 or flsp25 alone. Two other Hsp90 inhibitors, 17-allylamino-17demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG) and radicicol, and pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate induced robust expression of Hsp70 and Hsp40 in motor neurons, but at cytotoxic concentrations. 17-AAG, which penetrates the blood-brain barrier, has exhibited a higher therapeutic index than geldanamycin, but this may not be the case when activation of Hsf1 in neurons is targeted.

Recent studies indicate an adverse effect even at relatively low exposure levels. In the present study, we used sensitive quantitative methods to assess tremor in chloralkali workers with current low exposure to Hg-0. Neurological examinations and recordings of tremor using both an accelerometer and a laser-based system were conducted in 43 mercury-exposed workers and 22 age-matched referents. The median urinary mercury concentration in exposed workers was 5.9 (1.3-25) mu g/g creatinine (mu g/gC), while it was 0.7 (0.2-4.1) mu g/gC in referents. The mean exposure time was 15 years, and the median cumulative mercury index was 161 years x mu g/gC in exposed workers. There were no differences between the exposed workers and the referents in the clinical evaluation of tremor. In the quantitative tremor tests, no associations were found with current or cumulative mercury exposure for the majority of tremor measures. There were indications that exposure to Hg-0 was associated with a lowering of tremor frequency in the non-dominant hand, and a possible interaction with smoking. The differences were small, however, and overall, this study indicates no significant adverse effects on tremor at these exposure levels. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

However, it is still unknown whether endogenously released acetylcholine exerts a tonic inhibition on nociceptive transmission through the nAChRs in the spinal dorsal horn. Here, we report the presence of such a tonic inhibitory mechanism in the spinal dorsal horn in mice. In behavioral experiments, intrathecal (i.t.) injection of non-selective nAChR antagonist mecamylamine and alpha 4 beta 2 subtype-selective antagonist dihydro-beta-erythroidine (DH beta E) dose-dependently induced thermal and mechanical hyperalgesia in mice while the alpha 7-selective antagonist methyl lycaconitine (MLA) had no effect. Similarly, antisense knock-down of alpha 4 subunit of nAChR, but not alpha 7 subunit, in spinal cord induced thermal and mechanical hyperalgesia. In whole-cell patch-clamp experiments in spinal cord slice preparation from adult mice, the frequency of miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs) observed in substantia gelatinosa (SG) neurons was decreased by mecamylamine and DH beta E, but not by MLA. The amplitudes of the mIPSCs were not affected. The nicotinic antagonists decreased the frequency of both GABAergic and glycinergic IPSCs. On the other hand, the nicotinic antagonists had no effect on the excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs). Finally, acetylcholine-esterase inhibitor neostigmine-induced facilitation of IPSO frequencies in SG neurons was inhibited by mecamylamine and DHPE. Altogether these findings suggest that nicotinic cholinergic system in the spinal dorsal horn can tonically inhibit nociceptive transmission through presynaptic facilitation of inhibitory neurotransmission in SG via the alpha 4 beta 2 subtype of nAChR.

The clinical spectrum of developmental language impairment in school-aged children: Language, cognitive, and motor findings	PEDIATRICS			English	Article						cognitive development; language disorders; developmental delay; motor development; language development	PRESCHOOL-CHILDREN; KINDERGARTEN-CHILDREN; DISORDERS; DIAGNOSIS; SPEECH; COORDINATION; PREVALENCE	OBJECTIVE. Our goal was to evaluate detailed school-age language, nonverbal cognitive, and motor development in children with developmental language impairment compared with age-matched controls. METHODS. Children with developmental language impairment or normal language development ( controls) aged 7 to 13 years were recruited. Children underwent language assessment ( Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals-4, Peabody Picture Vocabulary-3, Goldman-Fristoe Test of Articulation-2), nonverbal cognitive assessment ( Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-IV), and motor assessment ( Movement Assessment Battery for Children). Exclusion criteria were nonverbal IQ below the 5th percentile or an acquired language, hearing, autistic spectrum, or neurologic disorder. RESULTS. Eleven children with developmental language impairment ( 7: 4 boys/girls; mean age: 10.1 +/- 0.8 years) and 12 controls ( 5: 7 boys/girls; mean age: 9.5 +/- 1.8 years) were recruited. Children with developmental language impairment showed lower mean scores on language ( Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals-4 -developmental language impairment: 79.7 +/- 16.5; controls: 109.2 +/- 9.6; Goldman-Fristoe Test of Articulation-2-developmental language impairment: 94.1 +/- 10.6; controls: 104.0 +/- 2.8; Peabody Picture Vocabulary-3 -developmental language impairment: 90.5 +/- 13.8; controls: 100.1 +/- 11.6), cognitive ( Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-IV-developmental language impairment: 99.5 +/- 15.5; controls: 113.5 +/- 11.9), and motor measures ( Movement Assessment Battery for Children percentile-developmental language impairment: 12.7 +/- 16.7; controls: 66.1 +/- 30.6) and greater discrepancies between cognitive and language scores ( Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-IV/Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals-4-developmental language impairment: 17.8 +/- 17.8; controls: 1.2 +/- 12.7). Motor impairment was more common in children with developmental language impairment (70%) than controls (8%). CONCLUSIONS. Developmental language impairment is characterized by a broad spectrum of developmental impairments. Children identified on the basis of language impairment show significant motor comorbidity. Motor assessment should form part of the evaluation and follow-up of children with developmental language impairment.

A retrospective analysis showed differential responses to cholinesterase inhibitors (ChE-Is) in patients younger than 75 years. This analysis investigated the effect of BuChE genotype on response to ChE-I therapy in these patients. In a retrospective analysis, patients younger than 75 who had consented to pharmacogenetic analysis were divided into groups according to BuChE genotype. Efficacy measures were the Severe Impairment Battery (SIB), Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), Global Deterioration Scale (GDS), Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living Scale (ADCS-ADL). Changes on efficacy parameters were calculated for rivastigmine-treated and donepezil-treated patients in both groups. Of 114 (34.1%) patients younger than 75 who were successfully assessed for BuChE genotype, 76 (66.7%) were homozygous for wild-type BuChE, and 38 (33.3%) carried at least one BuChE K-variant allele. Wild-type BuChE carriers showed significantly greater responses to rivastigmine than to donepezil on the SIB, ADCS-ADL, GDS and NPI. No significant between-treatment differences in efficacy were observed in BuChE K-variant carriers, although adverse events were more frequent in rivastigmine-treated patients. In this retrospective analysis, Alzheimer's disease patients younger than 75 with wild-type BuChE exhibited differential efficacy to rivastigmine, while BuChE K-variant carriers experienced similar long-term treatment effects with both agents. These differences may reflect rivastigmine's ability to inhibit BuChE and AChE.

The present study examined the effects of melanotan-II (NIT-II), a cyclic peptide analogue of alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone on appetitive and consummatory aspects of female sexual behavior, including aspects of sexual proceptivity (solicitations, hops and darts, ear wiggling, pacing) and receptivity (lordosis). One group of ovariectomized Long-Evans rats (n = 7) was primed subcutaneously with estradiol benzoate (EB) and progesterone (P) (10 mu g and 500 mu g respectively) and another group (n = 7) with EB (10 mu g) and oil (EB alone). Paced mating tests were performed with sexually experienced males in unilevel chambers, which were bisected by a Plexiglas divider containing three holes, through which only the female could pass. MT-II (1 and 3 mg/kg) or saline was injected intravenously 10 min before each 30-min paced mating test. Each female received the 3 treatments. In females primed with EB +P both doses of MT-II increased the number of hops and darts and car wiggling significantly, but did not alter pacing or lordosis. With EB alone, no effect of MT-II was observed on any of the parameters measured. These results suggest that P can interact with MT-II to increase proceptive behaviors. Because hops and darts are essentially solicitations, made in close proximity to the male, that indicate a desire on the part of females to receive mounts and intromissions, these data suggest that activation of melanocortin receptors may represent a promising mode of action for the treatment of women with hypoactive sexual desire.
