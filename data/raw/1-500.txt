J	Cascio, MA				Cascio, M. Ariel			Operationalizing New Biopolitical Theory for Anthropological Inquiry	ANTHROPOLOGICAL QUARTERLY			English	Article						Biosociality; biological citizenship; biopolitics; data analysis; ethnography; autism	BIOLOGICAL CITIZENSHIP; UNITED-STATES; RAW-MILK; AUTISM; HEALTH; NEURODIVERSITY; DISORDERS; POLITICS; SCIENCE; CANCER	In the nearly 20 years since Rabinow's 1996 "Artificiality and Enlightenment: From Sociobiology to Biosociality," scholarly attention to biosociality and related concepts such as biological citizenship have expanded Foucault's theories of biopolitics, updating them-as it were-for the 21st century. In this commentary, I explicate these "new biopolitical theories" and propose a schema for operationalizing them for deductive analyses in ethnographic research. I illustrate the way this schema may be applied with examples from an ethnographic study on autism in Italy. In doing so, I provide a model of new biopolitical theory that can be used in future projects in a variety of research settings and put scholarship on biosocialities and biological citizenships in more explicit conversation with each other. Such robust conversation will further scholarly understanding of biopolitics in general and of the local particularity of biologies, biomedicines, and politics that affect them.	[Cascio, M.

In certain application scenarios, however, this matrix is either rank deficient or very ill conditioned, so this requirement cannot be fulfilled. In this paper, we investigate possible solutions to this important problem based on subspace techniques for single -channel time-domain noise reduction. The eigenvalue decomposition is applied to both the speech and noise correlation matrices to separate the null and nonnull subspaces. Then, a set of optimal and suboptimal filters are derived from the nullspace of the noise signal. Through simulations, we observe that the proposed filters are able to significantly reduce noise without introducing much distortion to the desired signal. In comparison with the conventional Wiener approach, the developed filters perform significantly better in improving both the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the perceptual evaluation of speech quality (PESQ) score when the noise correlation matrix is rank deficient.

Learning features for offline handwritten signature verification using deep convolutional neural networks	PATTERN RECOGNITION			English	Article						Signature verification; Convolutional Neural Networks; Feature learning; Deep learning	ONLINE; IDENTIFICATION; CLASSIFIER; STATE; ART	Verifying the identity of a person using handwritten signatures is challenging in the presence of skilled forgeries, where a forger has access to a person's signature and deliberately attempt to imitate it. In offline (static) signature verification, the dynamic information of the signature writing process is lost, and it is difficult to design good feature extractors that can distinguish genuine signatures and skilled forgeries. This reflects in a relatively poor performance, with verification errors around 7% in the best systems in the literature. To address both the difficulty of obtaining good features, as well as improve system performance, we propose learning the representations from signature images, in a Writer-Independent format, using Convolutional Neural Networks. In particular, we propose a novel formulation of the problem that includes knowledge of skilled forgeries from a subset of users in the feature learning process, that aims to capture visual cues that distinguish genuine signatures and forgeries regardless of the user. Extensive experiments were conducted on four datasets: GPDS, 1VICYT, CEDAR and Brazilian PUC-PR datasets. On GPDS-160, we obtained a large improvement in state-of-the-art performance, achieving 1.72% Equal Error Rate, compared to 6.97% in the literature. We also verified that the features generalize beyond the GPDS dataset, surpassing the state-of-the-art performance in the other datasets, without requiring the representation to be fine-tuned to each particular dataset.

Cannabis and cue-induced craving in cocaine-dependent individuals: A pilot study	ADDICTIVE BEHAVIORS			English	Article						Cocaine; Cannabis; Craving; Neuroimaging; Relapse; Withdrawal	RELIABILITY; SEVERITY; ALCOHOL; ADDICTION; VALIDITY; INCREASE; STRESS; HEROIN	Background: Cannabis consumption is common among cocaine users; however, little is known about its effect on cocaine craving. The objective of this study was to assess whether cannabis co-use is associated with lower cue induced cocaine craving in non-treatment-seeking cocaine-dependent individuals. Methods: Data from twenty-eight cocaine-dependent men were analyzed in this pilot study. Cocaine-dependent subjects (n = 12) were compared with cocaine-dependent subjects who also abused or were dependent on cannabis (n = 16). After at least 72 h of cocaine abstinence, verified using the Timeline Followback and a drug screening test, subjects participated in a functional magnetic resonance imaging session during which neutral and drug cue video sequences were presented. Each sequence comprised four video blocks alternating with resting blocks. We report here subjective craving measures that were collected using the Visual Analog Scale, administered before and after each video block as per standard craving measurement paradigms. Results: Cocaine craving was successfully induced, with no significant difference in cue-induced craving between the two groups. However, post-hoc analyses revealed a significant increase in pre-video cocaine craving scores over time among individuals with cannabis use disorders. Conclusion: We could not highlight significant differences in cocaine craving induction between groups, but we observed a possible deficit in craving decay in the cocaine and cannabis group. In light of this finding, methodology of craving assessment in non-treatment-seeking users, particularly when different substances are combined, should possibly include outcomes linked to craving decay. Studies examining the association between cocaine craving decay and other outcome measures, such as relapse, are also warranted.

To solve this problem we design a multi-start constructive algorithm to train a discrete artificial neural network using a randomized greedy strategy to add neurons to the network hidden layer. The process of weights' searching for the neurons to be added is based on solving linear programming formulations. The computational experiments show that the proposed algorithm is much more efficient when the dual formulations are used to find the weights of the network neurons and that the obtained classifier has good levels of generalization accuracy. In addition, the proposed algorithm can be straight applied to other multi-class classification problems with more than three classes. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

We begin with the transformation of MRI into the L*a*b* color space to have a good effect on image contrast. With statistical measurements, a subsequent multivariable thresholding segmentation is performed in order to find a measurable detection region of grey matter (GM) voxel intensities in the L* histograms (DRGMVI-L*), where the scale model of MRI in the L* histograms provides an interface between the boundary GM volume and the group phenomena of interest quantitatively for detecting AD-dementia. Experiments validate the approach using extracted voxel-based features of tissue in the DRGMVI-L* on the real-time data of OASIS. The study reveals that (a) on average, the group of normal control (NC) exhibits a larger volume of GM voxel significantly than those two subject groups with AD-dementia (the group of AD with CDR = 2 and the group of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) with CDR = 0.5 or 1), with likelihood ratios of NC/MCl/AD at 1:0.8721:0.7587 and 1:0.9524:0.8412 in the anatomical transverse and sagittal sections, respectively; (b) the group of NC appears to have a signaling pulse of GM phenomenally, compared to the groups of AD and MCI with approximately uniform across or slightly concave in the DRGMVI-L*; this may prove to be unique biomarkers of disease in differentiating subjects with AD-dementia from the NC group, and may further develop to assist in identifying difficult cases of MCI. Additionally, in the cross validation, the results show that the proposed approach improves the performance with a hit rate of 0.826 as compared with published results in the literature in the detection of AD-dementia in MRI.

One of the major factor behind these successes is the availability of high quality parallel corpora. We explore two strategies on leveraging abundant amount of monolingual data for neural machine translation. We observe improvements by both combining scores from neural language model trained only on target monolingual data with neural machine translation model and fusing hidden-states of these two models. We obtain up to 2 BLEU improvement over hierarchical and phrase-based baseline on low-resource language pair, Turkish -> English. Our method was initially motivated towards tasks with less parallel data, but we also show that it extends to high resource languages such as Cs -> En and De -> En translation tasks, where we obtain 0.39 and 0.47 BLEU improvements over the neural machine translation baselines, respectively.

J	Choi, H; Cho, K; Bengio, Y				Choi, Heeyoul; Cho, Kyunghyun; Bengio, Yoshua			Context-dependent word representation for neural machine translation	COMPUTER SPEECH AND LANGUAGE			English	Article						Neural machine translation; Contextualization; Symbolization		We first observe a potential weakness of continuous vector representations of symbols in neural machine translation. That is, the continuous vector representation, or a word embedding vector, of a symbol encodes multiple dimensions of similarity, equivalent to encoding more than one meaning of the word. This has the consequence that the encoder and decoder recurrent networks in neural machine translation need to spend substantial amount of their capacity in disambiguating source and target words based on the context which is defined by a source sentence. Based on this observation, in this paper we propose to contextualize the word embedding vectors using a nonlinear bag-of-words representation of the source sentence. Additionally, we propose to represent special tokens (such as numbers, proper nouns and acronyms) with typed symbols to facilitate translating those words that are. not well-suited to be translated via continuous vectors. The experiments on En-Fr and En-De reveal that the proposed approaches of contextualization and symbolization improves the translation quality of neural machine translation systems significantly.

The proposed approach enables a single neural translation model to translate between multiple languages, with a number of parameters that grows only linearly with the number of languages. This is made possible by having a single attention mechanism that is shared across all language pairs. We train the proposed multi-way, multilingual model on ten language pairs from WMT'15 simultaneously and observe clear performance improvements over models trained on only one language pair. We empirically evaluate the proposed model on low-resource language translation tasks. In particular, we observe that the proposed multilingual model outperforms strong conventional statistical machine translation systems on Turkish-English and Uzbek-English by incorporating the resources of other language pairs.

We reported that supernatants (Sup) from cultured B cells from blood of relapsing remitting MS (RRMS) patients, but not normal controls (NC), were cytotoxic to rat oligodendrocytes (OL). We now show that RRMS blood B cells, not stimulated in vitro, secrete factor/s toxic to rat and human neurons.

The safety and efficacy of treatments have not been compared in a randomised trial. How to treat patients with UIAs suitable for both options remains unknown. Methods We randomly allocated clipping or coiling to patients with one or more 3-25 mm UIAs judged treatable both ways. The primary outcome was treatment failure, defined as: initial failure of aneurysm treatment, intracranial haemorrhage or residual aneurysm on 1-year imaging. Secondary outcomes included neurological deficits following treatment, hospitalisation >5 days, overall morbidity and mortality and angiographic results at 1 year. Results The trial was designed to include 260 patients. An analysis was performed for slow accrual: 136 patients were enrolled from 2010 through 2016 and 134 patients were treated. The 1-year primary outcome, available for 104 patients, was reached in 5/48 (10.4% (4.5%-22.2%)) patients allocated surgical clipping, and 10/56 (17.9% (10.0%-29.8%)) patients allocated endovascular coiling (OR: 0.54 (0.13-1.90), p=0.40). Morbidity and mortality (modified Rankin Scale>2) at 1 year occurred in 2/48 (4.2% (1.2%-14.0%)) and 2/56 (3.6% (1.0%-12.1%)) patients allocated clipping and coiling, respectively. New neurological deficits (15/65 vs 6/69; OR: 3.12 (1.05-10.57), p=0.031), and hospitalisations beyond 5 days (30/65 vs 6/69; OR: 8.85 (3.22-28.59), p=0.0001) were more frequent after clipping. Conclusion Surgical clipping or endovascular coiling of UIAs did not show differences in morbidity at 1 year. Trial continuation and additional randomised evidence will be necessary to establish the supposed superior efficacy of clipping.	[Darsaut, Tim E.; Findlay, J.

Social motivation and conflict resolution tactics as potential building blocks of sociality in cichlid fishes	BEHAVIOURAL PROCESSES			English	Article						Cooperative breeding; Sociality; Group living; Aggression; Submission; Lake Tanganyika	NEOLAMPROLOGUS-PULCHER PISCES; COOPERATIVELY BREEDING FISH; BRAIN GENE-EXPRESSION; LAKE TANGANYIKA; DOMINANCE HIERARCHIES; BEHAVIOR; HELPERS; EVOLUTION; SIZE; RELATEDNESS	Even closely related and ecologically similar cichlid species of Lake Tanganyika exhibit an impressive diversity of social systems, and therefore these fishes offer an excellent opportunity to examine the evolution of social behaviour. Sophisticated social relationships are thought to have evolved via a building block design where more fundamental social behaviours and cognitive processes have been combined, incrementally modified, and elaborated over time. Here, we studied two of these putative social building blocks in two closely related species of cichlids: Neolamprologus pukher, a group-living species, and Telmatochromis temporalis, a non-grouping species. Otherwise well matched in ecology, this pair of species provide an excellent comparison point to understand how behavioural processes may have been modified in relation to the evolution of sociality. Using social assays in both the laboratory and in the field, we explored each species' motivation to interact with conspecifics, and each species' conflict resolution tactics. We found that individuals of the group living species, N. pukher, displayed higher social motivation and were more likely to produce submission displays than were individuals of the non-grouping species, T. temporalis. We argue that the motivation to interact with conspecifics is a necessary prerequisite for the emergence of group living, and that the use of submission reduces the costs of conflict and facilitates the maintenance of close social proximity. These results suggest that social motivation and conflict resolution tactics are associated with social complexity, and that these behavioural traits may be functionally significant in the evolution and maintenance of sociality.

Methods and Materials: We created a retrospective multi-institutional database of 823 patients with melanoma and brain metastases diagnosed between 2006 and 2015. Clinical parameters, gene mutation status (BRAF, C-KIT, NRAS), and treatment were correlated with survival. Treatment patterns and outcomes were compared with a prior era (1985-2005). Results: BRAF status was known in 584 of 823 patients (71%). BRAF, NRAS, and C-KIT mutations were present in 51%, 22%, and 11% of tested patients, respectively. The median time from primary diagnosis to brain metastasis was 32 months, and overall median survival (MS) from the time of initial treatment of brain metastases was 10 months. MS for BRAF-positive and BRAF-negative patients was 13 months and 9 months, respectively (P=.02). There was no significant difference in MS in patients with or without NRAS or C-KIT mutations. The time from primary diagnosis to brain metastasis did not vary by mutation and was not associated with survival after the diagnosis of brain metastases. MS for the 1985 to 2005 and 2006 to 2015 cohorts was 6.7 months and 10.0 months, respectively (P<.01). Reflecting treatment-trend changes, use of whole-brain radiation therapy decreased from 48% to 26% during this period. Among BRAF-positive patients, 71% received targeted BRAF and/or MEK inhibitors and 57% received some combination of targeted therapy, chemotherapy, and/or immunotherapy. Conclusions: For melanoma patients with brain metastases, BRAF-positive patients survive longer than BRAF-negative patients and overall survival has improved from 1985-2005 to 2006-2015.

For unclear reasons, the lateral habenula (LHb), a key brain region involved in the pathophysiology of ADs, becomes hyperactive after ethanol withdrawal. M-type K+ channels (M-channels), important regulators of neuronal activity, are abundant in the LHb, yet little is known about their role in AUDs and associated ADs. We report here that in rats at 24 h withdrawal from systemic ethanol administration (either by intraperitoneal injection, 2 g/kg, twice/day, for 7 days; or intermittent drinking 20% ethanol in a two-bottle free choice protocol for 8 weeks), the basal firing rate and the excitability of LHb neurons in brain slices was higher, whereas the amplitude of medium afterhyperpolarization and M-type K+ currents were smaller, when compared to ethanol naive rats. Concordantly, M-channel blocker (XE991)-induced increase in the spontaneous firing rate in LHb neurons was smaller. The protein expression of M-channel subunits, KCNQ2/3 in the LHb was also smaller. Moreover, anxiety levels (tested in open field, marble burying, and elevated plus maze) were higher, which were alleviated by LHb inhibition either chemogenetically or by local infusion of the M-channel opener, retigabine. Intra-LHb infusion of retigabine also reduced ethanol consumption and preference. These findings reveal an important role of LHb M-channels in the expression of AUDs and ADs, and suggest that the M-channels could be a potential therapeutic target for alcoholics.

The objectives of this study were: (i) to examine SLE manifestation groups longitudinally in an SLE cohort; and (ii) to assess the association between early antimalarial treatment and renal manifestations. Methods Seven SLE manifestation groupscutaneous, hematologic, lung, musculoskeletal, neuropsychiatric, serositis, renalwere tracked using Kaplan-Meier survival curves in an incident SLE cohort from Quebec health administrative data (n=2010). A subgroup with provincial drug insurance coverage was followed over time to examine the association between early antimalarial treatment (within three months after SLE diagnosis) and renal manifestations using a Cox proportional hazards survival model. Results Cutaneous manifestations was the most common manifestation at SLE diagnosis (30.0%, 95% CI: 27.7-32.2%). About two-thirds (66.2%, 95% CI: 63.4-68.9%) of patients had evidence of at least one SLE manifestation at diagnosis, which increased to 87.2% (95% CI: 84.2-90.3%) by the end of follow-up. After adjusting for age, sex, early concomitant systemic steroid therapy, Charlson comorbidity index, primary care visits in the year prior and other SLE manifestations at baseline, no statistically significant association was established between antimalarial therapy and renal manifestations. Conclusion This study provides insight regarding organ manifestations within a population-based sample. Most patients identified with SLE had other diagnostic evidence that supports an underlying diagnosis of SLE. No protective effects for antimalarial agents against renal manifestations could be established in this population-based cohort.

Research indicates that abnormalities in brain connectivity are associated with these behavioral features. However, the inclusion of individuals past the age of onset of the defining behaviors complicates interpretation of the observed abnormalities: they may be cascade effects of earlier neuropathology and behavioral abnormalities. Our recent study of network efficiency in a cohort of 24-month-olds at high and low familial risk for ASD reduced this confound; we reported reduced network efficiencies in toddlers classified with ASD. The current study maps the emergence of these inefficiencies in the first year of life. METHODS: This study uses data from 260 infants at 6 and 12 months of age, including 116 infants with longitudinal data. As in our earlier study, we use diffusion data to obtain measures of the length and strength of connections between brain regions to compute network efficiency. We assess group differences in efficiency within linear mixedeffects models determined by the Akaike information criterion. RESULTS: Inefficiencies in high-risk infants later classified with ASD were detected from 6 months onward in regions involved in low-level sensory processing. In addition, within the high-risk infants, these inefficiencies predicted 24-month symptom severity. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that infants with ASD, even before 6 months of age, have deficits in connectivity related to low-level processing, which contribute to a developmental cascade affecting brain organization and eventually higher-level cognitive processes and social behavior.

We attempted to confirm and extend this finding in a larger independent sample. METHODS: A longitudinal magnetic resonance imaging study of infants at risk for ASD was carried out on 343 infants, who underwent neuroimaging at 6, 12, and 24 months. Of these infants, 221 were at high risk for ASD because of an older sibling with ASD, and 122 were at low risk with no family history of ASD. A total of 47 infants were diagnosed with ASD at 24 months and were compared with 174 high-risk and 122 low-risk infants without ASD. RESULTS: Infants who developed ASD had significantly greater extra-axial CSF volume at 6 months compared with both comparison groups without ASD (18% greater than high-risk infants without ASD; Cohen's d = 0.54). Extraaxial CSF volume remained elevated through 24 months (d = 0.46). Infants with more severe autism symptoms had an even greater volume of extra-axial CSF from 6 to 24 months (24% greater at 6 months, d = 0.70; 15% greater at 24 months, d = 0.70). Extra-axial CSF volume at 6 months predicted which high-risk infants would be diagnosed with ASD at 24 months with an overall accuracy of 69% and corresponding 66% sensitivity and 68% specificity, which was fully cross-validated in a separate sample. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms and extends previous findings that increased extra-axial CSF is detectable at 6 months in high-risk infants who develop ASD. Future studies will address whether this anomaly is a contributing factor to the etiology of ASD or an early risk marker for ASD.

Superoxide dismutase 1 is positively selected to minimize protein aggregation in great apes	CELLULAR AND MOLECULAR LIFE SCIENCES			English	Article						Primate evolution; Evolution of aging; Superoxide dismutase 1; Oxidative stress; Protein aggregation	AMYOTROPHIC-LATERAL-SCLEROSIS; COMPARATIVE PRIMATE GENOMICS; CODON-SUBSTITUTION MODELS; EFFECTIVE POPULATION-SIZE; MOLECULAR EVOLUTION; LIFE-SPAN; STABILITY CHANGES; METABOLIC-RATE; SEQUENCE EVOLUTION; MITOCHONDRIAL-DNA	Positive (adaptive) selection has recently been implied in human superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), a highly abundant antioxidant protein with energy signaling and antiaging functions, one of very few examples of direct selection on a human protein product (exon); the molecular drivers of this selection are unknown. We mapped 30 extant SOD1 sequences to the recently established mammalian species tree and inferred ancestors, key substitutions, and signatures of selection during the protein's evolution. We detected elevated substitution rates leading to great apes (Hominidae) at similar to 1 per 2 million years, significantly higher than in other primates and rodents, although these paradoxically generally evolve much faster. The high evolutionary rate was partly due to relaxation of some selection pressures and partly to distinct positive selection of SOD1 in great apes. We then show that higher stability and net charge and changes at the dimer interface were selectively introduced upon separation from old world monkeys and lesser apes (gibbons). Consequently, human, chimpanzee and gorilla SOD1s have a net charge of -6 at physiological pH, whereas the closely related gibbons and macaques have -3. These features consistently point towards selection against the malicious aggregation effects of elevated SOD1 levels in long-living great apes. The findings mirror the impact of human SOD1 mutations that reduce net charge and/or stability and cause ALS, a motor neuron disease characterized by oxidative stress and SOD1 aggregates and triggered by aging. Our study thus marks an example of direct selection for a particular chemical phenotype (high net charge and stability) in a single human protein with possible implications for the evolution of aging.

These low-frequency oscillations are thought to be generated through local circuit interactions between Golgi cells and granule cells within the GCL. Golgi cells display rhythmic firing and pacemaking properties, and also are electrically coupled through gap junctions within the GCL. Here, we tested if gap junctions in the rat cerebellar cortex contribute to the generation of LFP oscillations in the GCL. We recorded LFP oscillations under urethane anesthesia, and examined the effects of local infusion of gap junction blockers on 5-15 Hz oscillations. Local infusion of the gap junction blockers carbenoxolone and mefloquine resulted in significant decreases in the power of oscillations over a 30-min period, but the power of oscillations was unchanged in control experiments following vehicle injections. In addition, infusion of gap junction blockers had no significant effect on multi-unit activity, suggesting that the attenuation of low-frequency oscillations was likely due to reductions in electrical coupling rather than a decreased excitability within the granule cell layer. Our results indicate that electrical coupling among the Golgi cell networks in the cerebellar cortex contributes to the local circuit mechanisms that promote the occurrence of GCL LFP slow oscillations in the anesthetized rat.

J	Guimond, S; Hawco, C; Lepage, M				Guimond, Synthia; Hawco, Colin; Lepage, Martin			Prefrontal activity and impaired memory encoding strategies in schizophrenia	JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRIC RESEARCH			English	Article						Schizophrenia; Episodic memory; Associative encoding; Encoding strategies; Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex	LONG-TERM-MEMORY; ASSOCIATIVE MEMORY; ORGANIZATIONAL STRATEGIES; EPISODIC MEMORY; ANTIPSYCHOTICS; HETEROGENEITY; METAANALYSIS; PERFORMANCE; MECHANISMS; DEFICITS	Schizophrenia patients have significant memory difficulties that have far-reaching implications in their daily life. These impairments are partly attributed to an inability to self-initiate effective memory encoding strategies, but its core neurobiological correlates remain unknown. The current study addresses this critical gap in our knowledge of episodic memory impairments in schizophrenia. Schizophrenia patients (n = 35) and healthy controls (n = 23) underwent a Semantic Encoding Memory Task (SEMT) during an fMRI scan. Brain activity was examined for conditions where participants were a) prompted to use semantic encoding strategies, or b) not prompted but required to self-initiate such strategies. When prompted to use semantic encoding strategies, schizophrenia patients exhibited similar recognition performance and brain activity as healthy controls. However, when required to self-initiate these strategies, patients had significant reduced recognition performance and brain activity in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, as well as in the left temporal gyrus, left superior parietal lobule, and cerebellum. When patients were divided based on performance on the SEMT, the subgroup with more severe deficits in self-initiation also showed greater reduction in left dorsolateral prefrontal activity. These results suggest that impaired self-initiation of elaborative encoding strategies is a driving feature of memory deficits in schizophrenia. We also identified the neural correlates of impaired self-initiation of semantic encoding strategies, in which a failure to activate the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex plays a key role. These findings provide important new targets in the development of novel treatments aiming to improve memory and ultimately patients' outcome. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Of growing interest to addiction researchers is whether or not this process results in the attribution of incentive salience to alcohol-predictive cues, which could motivate alcohol-seeking behavior and relapse. To evaluate this question, we present a review of rodent behavioral studies that examined the capacity of alcohol-predictive cues to (i) support sign-tracking behavior, (ii) serve as conditioned reinforcers, and (iii) produce Pavlovian-to-instrumental transfer. A second, emerging area of research is focused on delineating the role of context in alcohol-seeking behavior and relapse. Here, we review studies showing that alcohol-associated contexts (i) support conditioned place preference, (ii) renew extinguished alcohol-seeking behavior, and (iii) modulate alcohol-seeking responses elicited by discrete alcohol predictive cues. These behavioral effects may be mediated by unique psychological processes, and have important implications for cue-reactivity studies and neurobiological research.

Here we investigate how contextual relevance affects CI processing and regulates the connectivity between Cl-processing-related brain regions. Participants listened to dialogues in which the level of contextual relevance to dialogue-final utterance (reply) was manipulated. This utterance was either direct, indirect but relevant, irrelevant with contextual hint, or irrelevant with no contextual hint. Results indicated that compared with direct replies, indirect replies showed increased activations in bilateral IFG, bilateral MTG, bilateral TPJ, dmPFC, and precuneus, and increased connectivity between rTPJ/dmPFC and both IFG and MTG. Moreover, irrelevant replies activated right MTG along an anterior-posterior gradient as a function of the level of irrelevance. Our study provides novel evidence concerning how the language and theory-of-mind networks interact for pragmatic inference and how the processing of CI is modulated by level of contextual relevance.

Mutations in the CLN5 gene are responsible for the Finnish variant late-infantile form of NCL (Finnish vLINCL). CLN5 is translated as a 407 amino acid transmembrane domain containing protein that is heavily glycosylated, and subsequently cleaved into a mature soluble protein. Functionally, CLN5 is implicated in the recruitment of the retromer complex to endosomes, which is required to sort the lysosomal sorting receptors from endosomes to the trans-Golgi network. The mechanism that processes CLN5 into a mature soluble protein is currently not known. Herein, we demonstrate that CLN5 is initially translated as a type II transmembrane protein and subsequently cleaved by SPPL3, a member of the SPP/SPPL intramembrane protease family, into a mature soluble protein consisting of residues 93-407. The remaining N-terminal fragment is then cleaved by SPPL3 and SPPL2b and degraded in the proteasome. This work further characterizes the biology of CLN5 in the hopes of identifying a novel therapeutic strategy for affected children.

The mixed evidence from the existing studies has led to contradictions in the literature regarding the bilingual advantage. Moreover, fMRI evidence on the neural basis of interference control mechanisms with the Simon task is limited. Previous work by our team showed that equivalent performance on the Simon task was associated with different activation maps in elderly bilinguals and monolinguals. This study aims to provide a more in-depth perspective on the neural bases of performance on the Simon task in elderly bilinguals and monolinguals, by adopting a network perspective for the functional connectivity analysis. A node-by-node analysis led to the identification of the specific topology that characterized the bilingual and monolingual functional networks and the degree of connectivity between each node across groups. Results showed greater connectivity in bilinguals in the inferior temporal sulcus, which plays a role in visuospatial processing. On the other hand, in monolinguals, brain areas involved in visual, motor, executive functions and interference control were more connected to resolve the same task. In other words, in comparison to the monolingual brain, the bilingual brain resolves visuospatial interference economically, by allocating fewer and more clustered regions. These results demonstrate a larger global efficiency in task performance in bilinguals as compared to monolinguals. Also, the provided evidence filters out the task-specific socalled bilingual advantage discussed in the literature and posits that bilinguals are strategically more efficient in a given performance than monolinguals, thus enhancing our understanding of successful aging.

High frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation treatment for major depression: Dissociated effects on psychopathology and neurocognition	JOURNAL OF AFFECTIVE DISORDERS			English	Article						Decision making; Impulse control; Major depressive disorder; Treatment resistant depression; Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS)	TREATMENT-RESISTANT DEPRESSION; MEDICATION-FREE PATIENTS; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; DECISION-MAKING; MOTOR THRESHOLD; COGNITIVE PERFORMANCE; DOUBLE-BLIND; LARGE-SAMPLE; OPEN-LABEL; DISORDER	Objectives: This open-label pilot study explored the effects of a course of accelerated high-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (HF-rTMS) on two neurocognitive domains (decision-making and impulse control) in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). Methods: Participants with MDD and a treatment resistant major depressive episode (n=24) underwent twice daily HF-rTMS targeted at the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (1DLPFC) over two weeks. Psychopathology was assessed by clinician-administered and self-reported measures of depression and anxiety; decision-making was assessed by the Iowa Gambling Task, the Balloon Analog Risk Task and the Game Of Dice Task; impulse control was assessed by the Stroop Color-Word Task, the Continuous Performance Task and the Stop-Signal Task. Results: Depression and anxiety scores significantly improved from pre-post HF-rTMS treatment. However, none of the decision-making or impulse control variables of interest changed significantly from pre-post HF-rTMS. Moreover, there was no correlation between changes in psychopathological symptoms and in neurocognition. Limitations: This is a moderately sized open label trial, and the confounds of ongoing psychotropics and illness chronicity can not be excluded in this treatment resistant sample. Conclusions: There is dissociation between acute symptomatic benefit after a course of accelerated HF-rTMS applied to the 1DLPFC in treatment resistant MDD and performance on tests of decision making and impulse control. Though rTMS appears cognitively safe, additional research is warranted to understand this potential dissociation and its putative clinical implications.

Fast scene analysis using vision and artificial intelligence for object prehension by an assistive robot	ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Scene analysis; Artficial vision; Artificial intelligence; Object grasping; Assistive robotics	RECOGNITION; SEGMENTATION	Robotic assistance for people affected by motor deficits is a fast growing field. In this context, two major challenges remain in terms of automated scene analysis and automated object prehension. More specifically, the most robust of current segmentation methods are still computationally intensive, preventing the automation of objects prehension from being fast enough to be considered acceptable as an everyday technical-aid. The objective of this study is to develop a fast scene analysis using vision and artificial intelligence for object prehension by an assistive robot. The solution developed in this paper aims at facilitating human-machine interaction by enabling users to easily communicate their needs to the technical aid. To achieve this, this paper proposes several novelties in three interconnected domains: scene segmentation, prehension and recognition of 3D objects. A novel technic, inspired by mechanical probing, is developed for scenes probing to detect objects. A simple, fast and effective decision tree is proposed for object prehension. Finally, the physical characteristics of the 3D objects are directly used in the neural network without using discriminants features descriptors. The results obtained in this paper have shown that scene analysis for robotic object prehension in cooperation with a user can be performed with effective promptness. Indeed, the system requires on average 0.6 s to analyze an object in a scene. With the JACO robotic assistance arm, the system can pick up a requested object in 15 s while moving at 50 mm/s, which may be greatly improved upon using a faster robot. The system performance averages 83% accuracy for object recognition and is able to use a decision tree to select a simple approach path for the robot end-effector towards a desired object. This system, in combination with an assistive robot, has great potential for providing users suffering from musculoskeletal disorders with improved autonomy and independence, and for encouraging sustained usage of this type of technical aids.

In this systematic review of cases (N = 82) and group studies (including 912 participants of which 315 are hyperlexic), we address: whether the hyperlexic profile is associated with autism and why, whether models of non-autistic reading can teach us about hyperlexia, and what additional information we can get from models specific to autistic cognitive functioning. We find that hyperlexia, or a hyperlexic-like profile, characterises a substantial portion of the autistic spectrum, in which the subcomponents of the typical reading architecture are altered and dissociated. Autistic children follow a chronologically inverted path when learning to read, and make extended use of the perceptual expertise system, specifically the visual word form recognition systems. We conclude by discussing the possible use of hyperlexic skills in intervention.

However, there are few aquatic toxicological studies addressing environmental effects of Gd which remains unknown in aquatic animals. Therefore, this study aimed to compare the effects of GdCl3 and a gadolinium-based MRI contrast agent (Omniscan), in zebra mussels after 28 days through a multibiomarker approach. Data revealed that after GdCl3 exposure, the mRNA level of metallothionein (MT) was modulated, those of cytochrome c oxidase (CO1) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were increased, while gene expressions of catalase (CAT) and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) were downregulated. Furthermore, neither lipoperoxidation (LPO) nor genotoxicity were detected but only a decrease in the cyclooxygenase (COX) activity was observed. In addition, a significant correlation was found between biomarkers and bioaccumulated Gd, suggesting that mitochondrial and anti-inflammatory pathways were triggered with GdCl3. By opposition, the contrasting agent formulation induced downregulation of SOD, CAT, GST and CO1, a decrease in the level of LPO and an increase in the GST and COX activities. This suggests that the chelated form of Gd did not promote reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and exhibits antioxidant and proinflammatory effects in mussels. Therefore, this study revealed that ionic and the chelated form of Gd influence different cellular pathways to initiate cellular changes. Crown Copyright (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The present study investigated neuroanatomical abnormalities in the FLN to find a possible neural signature for suicidal behavior in patients with bipolar disorder type I (BD-I). We used voxel-based morphometry to compare euthymic patients with BD-I who had attempted suicide (n = 20), who had not attempted suicide (n = 19) and healthy controls (HCs) (n = 20). We also assessed the highest medical lethality of their previous SA. Compared to the participants who had not attempted suicide, the patients with BD-I who had attempted suicide exhibited significantly increased gray matter volume (GMV) in the right rostral anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), which was more pronounced and extended further to the left ACC in the high-lethality subgroup (p < 0.05, with family-wise error (FWE) correction for multiple comparisons using small-volume correction). GMV in the insula and orbitofrontal cortex was also related to suicide lethality (p < 0.05, FWE-corrected). The current findings suggest that morphological changes in the FLN could be a signature of previous etiopathogenic processes affecting regions related to suicidality and its severity in BD-I patients.

The aim of this paper is to explore the development and alterations of the functional thalamocortical connectivity in preterm infants with and without punctate white matter lesions (PWMLs) during the period before term equivalent age (TEA). In this study, twenty-two normal preterm infants (NP), twenty-two preterm infants with PWMLs and thirty-one full-term control infants (FT) were enrolled. Thalamus parcellation was performed based on partial correlation between the thalamus and seven well-recognized infant networks obtained from independent component analysis (ICA), and thalamocortical connectivity was further reconstructed between the defined thalamus clusters and the whole brain. Thalamo-salience (SA) and thalamo-sensorimotor (SM) connectivity were predominantly identified, while other types of thalamocortical connectivity remained largely limited during the neonatal period. Both preterm groups exhibited prominent development in thalamo-SA and thalamo-SM connectivity during this period. Compared with NP infants, PWML infants demonstrated increased connectivity in the parietal area in thalamo-SA connectivity but no significant differences in thalamo-SM connectivity. Our results reveal that compared with NP infants, PWML infants exhibit slightly altered thalamo-SA connectivity, and this alteration is deduced to be functional compensations for inefficient thalamocortical processing due to PWMLs.

Thus, we investigated the changes in the sub cellular distribution of SERT and 5-HT1A receptors (5-HT1AR) in the rat olfactory bulbectomy model of depression using immuno-gold labeling and electron microscopy, and examined the effect of chronic treatment with the antidepressant, fluoxetine, a serotonin reuptake inhibitor, on the subcellular distribution of SERT and 5-HT1AR. The density of plasma membrane labeling of 5-HT1A auto-receptors on dendrites of dorsal raphe neurons was increased after bulbectomy, but the 5-11T1A hetero-receptor membrane labeling on dendrites of CA3 hippocampal neurons was not. The density of membrane labeling of SERTs was increased both in dendrites of dorsal raphe neuron and axon terminals in the hippocampus after bulbectomy. However, the proportion of 5-HT1AR and SERT membrane labeling relative to total labeling was unchanged, suggesting an increase in protein levels. The increases in 5-HT1AR and SERTs membrane labeling induced by bulbectomy were reversed by chronic fluoxetine treatment, and these changes were associated with a reduction in the relative proportion of membrane versus total labeling, consistent with a protein shift between subcellular compartments. Our findings support the hypothesis that changes in efficacy of serotonergic neurotransmission in this model of depression depends on both activity and density of cell surface-expressed SERT and 5-HT1A auto-receptors.

A group of neurologically typical adult participants performed a visually guided mediolateral (left right) weight shifting task requiring precise adjustments in body orientation. During one phase of the task, the visual feedback of center of pressure (COP) was systematically biased toward the left or the right, requiring an adjustment in posture to compensate. COP during quiet standing without visual feedback was examined prior to and immediately following the sensorimotor adaptation procedure, in order to observe whether compensatory adjustments in postural control resulting from the visual feedback manipulation would transfer to the control of whole-body COP during quiet standing. Results showed that the sensorimotor adaptation procedure induced a small but reliable compensatory change in the stance of participants, resulting in a change in postural symmetry and control that was found to persist even after normal visual feedback was restored.

Its importance in sound and acoustical design of consumer products no longer needs to be demonstrated. One of the challenges is the creation of a prediction model that is able to predict the results of a listening test while using metrics derived from the sound stimuli. Often, these models are either derived using linear regression on a limited set of experimenter-selected metrics, or using more complex algorithms such as neural networks. In the former case, the user-selected metrics can bias the model and reflect the engineer pre-conceived idea of sound quality while missing potential features. In the latter case, although prediction might be efficient, the model is often in the form of a black-box which is difficult to use as a sound design guideline for engineers. In this paper, preprocessing by participants clustering and three different algorithms are compared in order to construct a sound quality prediction model that does not suffer from these limitations. The lasso, elastic-net and stepwise algorithms are tested for listening tests of consumer product for which 91 metrics are used as potential predictors. Based on the reported results, it is shown that the most promising algorithm is the lasso which is able to (1) efficiently limit the number of metrics, (2) most accurately predict the results of listening tests, and (3) provide a meaningful model that can be used as understandable design guidelines.

This study addressed these gaps in knowledge, reporting on findings from a prospective, longitudinal follow-up study that investigated social outcomes post-injury and explored factors contributing to these outcomes at two years post-injury. The sample included 113 children, 74 with TBI and 39 typically developing (TD) controls. TBI participants were recruited on presentation to the hospital. Parents rated pre-injury function at that time, and all children underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Participants were followed up at two years post-injury. Outcomes were social adjustment, social participation, social relationships, and social cognition. Predictors of social outcomes examined included brain lesion characteristics, child cognition (6 months post-TBI), and behavior and environmental factors (pre-injury and two years). Reduced social adjustment (p=0.011) and social participation (p<0.001) were evident in children with TBI compared with TD controls. Poor social adjustment was predicted by externalizing behavior problems and younger age at injury. Reduced social participation was linked to internalizing behavior problems. Greater lesion volume, lower socioeconomic status, and family burden contributed to poorer social relationships, whereas age at injury predicted social cognition. Within the TBI group, 23% of children exhibited social impairments. Younger age at injury, greater pre-injury, and current behavior problems and family dysfunction, and poorer intelligence quotient (IQ), processing speed, and empathy were linked to impairment. Further follow-up is required to track social recovery and the influences of cognition, brain, and environment over time.	[Anderson, Vicki; Crossley, Louise; Ryan, Nicholas; Hearps, Stephen J.

Seven out of 25 Sprague-Dawley rats experiencing 1 h of pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus (SE) began treatment with allopregnanolone (9.6-12.8 mg/kg/day) on the following day. On day 4 after SE, video-depth EEG recordings from the hippocampal CA3 subfield and the entorhinal cortex were initiated and continued for 12 consecutive days. We found that 66.7% (12/18) of untreated animals exhibited seizures compared to 28.6% (2/7) of allopregnanolone-treated animals. Interictal spikes occurred less frequently in the CA3 subfield of allopregnanolone-treated rats (n = 4) than in untreated animals presenting (n = 4) or not presenting (n = 4) with spontaneous seizures (p < 0.05), and were less frequent in the entorhinal cortex compared to both untreated groups (p < 0.05). Finally, allopregnanolone-treated rats had significantly lower rates of interictal spikes with fast ripples (250-500 Hz) compared to untreated animals but only in CA3 (p < 0.05). Our findings show that allopregnanolone reduces the frequency of interictal spikes and fast ripples in CA3, a structure that plays an important role in ictogenesis and epileptogenesis. Neurosteroids may therefore influence pathological network activity leading to spontaneous seizures following pilocarpine-induced SE. Recordings after termination of allopregnanolone treatment will be however required to establish whether allopregnanolone exerts disease-modifying properties. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Targeting glutamatergic and cellular prion protein mechanisms of amyloid beta-mediated persistent synaptic plasticity disruption: Longitudinal studies	NEUROPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Alzheimer's disease; Long-term potentiation; Glutamate-oxalate transaminase; Metabotropic glutamate receptor 5; APP transgenic rat	LONG-TERM POTENTIATION; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; RECEPTOR 5; COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; IN-VIVO; BLOOD GLUTAMATE; RAT MODEL; OXALOACETATE TRANSAMINASE; ALLOSTERIC MODULATOR; CEREBROSPINAL-FLUID	Alzheimer's disease amyloid-beta (A beta) oligomers are synaptotoxic, inappropriately increasing extracellular glutamate concentration and glutamate receptor activation to thereby rapidly disrupt synaptic plasticity. Thus, acutely promoting brain glutamate homeostasis with a blood-based scavenging system, glutamate-oxaloacetate transaminase (GOT), and blocking metabotropic glutamate 5 (mGlu5) receptor or its co-receptor cellular prion protein (PrP), prevent the acute inhibition of long-term potentiation (LTP) by exogenous A beta. Here, we evaluated the time course of the effects of such interventions in the persistent disruptive effects of A beta oligomers, either exogenously injected in wild type rats or endogenously generated in transgenic rats that model Alzheimer's disease amyloidosis. We report that repeated, but not acute, systemic administration of recombinant GOT type 1, with or without the glutamate co-substrate oxaloacetate, reversed the persistent deleterious effect of exogenous A beta on synaptic plasticity. Moreover, similar repetitive treatment reversibly abrogated the inhibition of LTP monitored longitudinally in freely behaving transgenic rats. Remarkably, brief repeated treatment with an mGlu5 receptor antagonist, basimglurant, or an antibody that prevents A beta oligomer binding to PrP, ICSM35, also had similar reversible ameliorative effects in the transgenic rat model. Overall, the present findings support the ongoing development of therapeutics for early Alzheimer's disease based on these complementary approaches. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

However, many of these characteristics evolve significantly with age. Secondary analysis on these data explored whether the characteristics associated with different risky driving profiles were influenced by driver age. Methods: Data (N = 138) on three driving groups (i.e., alcohol impaired [DWI], reckless [SPEED], and impaired and reckless [MIXED]), and a low-risk control group [CTL] were stratified by age (younger: 19-28; older: 2939). Younger and older drivers of each risky driving group were compared to their age-matched CTLs on driving simulation, personality, and cognitive control. Results: In DWI, elevated behavioural disinhibition was observed only in older drivers. In MIXED, elevated reward sensitivity and risky driving behaviour were seen only in older drivers. In SPEED, greater risky driving and lower agreeableness personality were only seen in young drivers, while elevated sensation seeking and risk taking were observed only in older drivers. Discussion: Unique processes predominate in distinct forms of risky driving behaviour at different developmental stages. More effective prevention strategies may require intervention tailoring based on both risky driving preference and age. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Applied doses are lower than those needed to unfold an antidepressive effect. While efficacy of antidepressants for chronic pain has been reported in large randomized controlled trials (ROT), there is inconsistent data on adverse effects and tolerability. We aimed at synthesizing data from ROT to explore adverse effect profiles and tolerability of antidepressants for treatment of chronic pain. Methods: Systematic literature research and meta-analyses were performed regarding side effects and safety of different antidepressants in the treatment of chronic pain according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. The National Center for Biotechnology Information library and MEDLINE were searched. Randomized placebo-controlled trials were included in quantitative data synthesis. Results: Out of 1,975 screened articles, 33 papers published between 1995 and 2015 were included in our review and 23 studies were included in the meta-analyses. A higher risk for adverse effects compared to placebo was observed in all antidepressants included in our analyses, except nortriptyline. The most prevalent adverse effects were dry mouth, dizziness, nausea, headache, and constipation. Amitriptyline, mirtazapine, desipramine, venlafaxine, fluoxetine, and nortriptyline showed the highest placebo effect-adjusted risk of adverse effects. Risk for withdrawal due to adverse effects was highest in desipramine (risk ratio: 4.09, 95%-confidence interval [1.31; 12.82]) followed by milnacipran, venlafaxine, and duloxetine. The most common adverse effects under treatment with antidepressants were dry mouth, dizziness, nausea, headache, and constipation followed by palpitations, sweating, and drowsiness. However, overall tolerability was high. Each antidepressant showed distinct risk profiles of adverse effects. fConclusion: Our synthesized data analysis confirmed overall tolerability of low-dose antidepressants for the treatment of chronic pain and revealed drug specific risk profiles. This encompassing characterization of adverse effect profiles might be useful in defining multimodal treatment regimens for chronic pain which also consider patients' comorbidities and co-medication.

GEFOS Anytype Fracture Consortium	Large-scale GWAS identifies multiple loci for hand grip strength providing biological insights into muscular fitness	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							GENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION; GROWTH-FACTOR-ALPHA; MENDELIAN RANDOMIZATION; SKELETAL-MUSCLE; GENETIC INFLUENCES; METAANALYSIS; DISEASE; INSTRUMENTS; FRACTURES; VARIANTS	Hand grip strength is a widely used proxy of muscular fitness, a marker of frailty, and predictor of a range of morbidities and all-cause mortality. To investigate the genetic determinants of variation in grip strength, we perform a large-scale genetic discovery analysis in a combined sample of 195,180 individuals and identify 16 loci associated with grip strength (P<5 x 10(-8)) in combined analyses. A number of these loci contain genes implicated in structure and function of skeletal muscle fibres (ACTG1), neuronal maintenance and signal transduction (PEX14, TGFA, SYT1), or monogenic syndromes with involvement of psychomotor impairment (PEX14, LRPPRC and KANSL1). Mendelian randomization analyses are consistent with a causal effect of higher genetically predicted grip strength on lower fracture risk. In conclusion, our findings provide new biological insight into the mechanistic underpinnings of grip strength and the causal role of muscular strength in age-related morbidities and mortality.

However, recent evidence indicates that, beyond classic reinforcement learning adaptations, individuals may also learn the inherent task structure and anticipate the occurrence of reversals. A candidate structure to support such task representation is the hippocampus, which might create a flexible representation of the environment that can be adaptively applied to goaldirected behavior. Toinvestigate the functional role of thehippocampusin the implementation of anticipatory strategies in reversal learning, we first studied, in 20 healthy individuals (11 women), whether the gray matter anatomy and volume of the hippocampus were related to anticipatory strategies in a reversal learning task. Second, wetested 20 refractory temporal lobe epileptic patients (11women) with unilateral hippocampal sclerosis, who served as a hippocampal lesion model. Our results indicate that healthy participants were able to learn the task structure and useit toguidetheirbehaviorandoptimizetheirperformance. Participants' ability toadoptanticipatory strategies correlatedwiththegraymatter volumeof the hippocampus. In contrast, hippocampal patients were unable to grasp the higher-order structure of the task with thesamesuccess than controls. Present results indicate that the hippocampus is necessary to respond in an appropriately flexible manner to high-order environments, and disruptions in this structure can render behavior habitual and inflexible.

For autosomal-dominant spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs), 28 genes have been identified, but only five SCAs originate from non-coding mutations. Over half of SCA-affected families, however, remain without a genetic diagnosis. We used genome-wide linkage analysis, NGS, and repeat analysis to identify an (ATTTC)(n) insertion in a polymorphic ATTTT repeat in DAB1 in chromosomal region 1p32.2 as the cause of autosomal-dominant SCA; this region has been previously linked to SCA37. The non-pathogenic and pathogenic alleles have the configurations [(ATTTT)(7-400)] and [(ATTTT)(60-79)(ATTTC)(31-75)(ATTTT)(58-90)], respectively. (ATTTC) n insertions are present on a distinct haplotype and show an inverse correlation between size and age of onset. In the DAB1-oriented strand, (ATTTC) n is located in 50 UTR introns of cerebellar-specific transcripts arising mostly during human fetal brain development from the usage of alternative promoters, but it is maintained in the adult cerebellum. Overexpression of the transfected (ATTTC)(58) insertion, but not (ATTTT) n, leads to abnormal nuclear RNA accumulation. Zebrafish embryos injected with RNA of the (AUUUC)(58) insertion, but not (AUUUU)(n), showed lethal developmental malformations. Together, these results establish an unstable repeat insertion in DAB1 as a cause of cerebellar degeneration; on the basis of the genetic and phenotypic evidence, we propose this mutation as the molecular basis for SCA37.

However, inter-and intra-observer variability is high with only a 30% positive predictive value for the classification of pathological outcomes. This has a significant negative impact on the perinatal foetus and often results in cardio-pulmonary arrest, brain and vital organ damage, cerebral palsy, hearing, visual and cognitive defects and in severe cases, death. This paper shows that using machine learning and foetal heart rate signals provides direct information about the foetal state and helps to filter the subjective opinions of medical practitioners when used as a decision support tool. The primary aim is to provide a proof-of-concept that demonstrates how machine learning can be used to objectively determine when medical intervention, such as caesarean section, is required and help avoid preventable perinatal deaths. Methods: This is evidenced using an open dataset that comprises 506 controls ( normal virginal deliveries) and 46 cases ( caesarean due to pH <= 7.20-acidosis, n = 18; pH > 7.20 and pH < 7.25-foetal deterioration, n = 4; or clinical decision without evidence of pathological outcome measures, n = 24). Several machine-learning algorithms are trained, and validated, using binary classifier performance measures. Results: The findings show that deep learning classification achieves sensitivity = 94%, specificity = 91%, Area under the curve = 99%, F-score = 100%, and mean square error = 1%. Conclusions: The results demonstrate that machine learning significantly improves the efficiency for the detection of caesarean section and normal vaginal deliveries using foetal heart rate signals compared with obstetrician and midwife predictions and systems reported in previous studies.

Specifically, acoustic and articulatory data were recorded while sighted and congenitally blind French speakers produced several repetitions of the vowel /phi/. At the acoustic level, blind speakers produced larger compensatory responses to altered vowels than their sighted peers. At the articulatory level, blind speakers also produced larger displacements of the upper lip, the tongue tip, and the tongue dorsum in compensatory responses. These findings suggest that blind speakers tolerate less discrepancy between actual and expected auditory feedback than sighted speakers. The study also suggests that sighted speakers have acquired more constrained somatosensory goals through the influence of visual cues perceived in face-to-face conversation, leading them to tolerate less discrepancy between expected and altered articulatory positions compared to blind speakers and thus resulting in smaller observed compensatory responses.

While there is presently no known cure for AD and current treatments having only a transient effect, an increasing number of publications indicate that growth factors (GF) may be used to treat AD. GFs like the bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), especially BMP-9, affect many aspects of AD. However, BMP-9 is a big protein that cannot readily cross the blood-brain barrier. We have therefore studied the effects of two small peptides derived from BMP-9 (pBMP-9 and SpBMP-9). We investigated their capacity to differentiate SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells into neurons with or without retinoic acid (RA). Both peptides induced Smad 1/5 phosphorylation and their nuclear translocation. They increased the number and length of neurites and the expression of neuronal markers MAP-2, NeuN and NSE better than did BMP-9. They also promoted differentiation to the cholinergic phenotype more actively than BMP-9, SpBMP-9 being the most effective as shown by increases in intracellular acetylcholine, ChAT and VAchT. Finally, both peptides activated the PI3K/Akt pathway and inhibited GSK3beta, a current AD therapeutic target. BMP-9-derived peptides, especially SpBMP-9, with or without RA, are promising molecules that warrant further investigation.

However, no study examined Slc6a15 in the ventral striatum [nucleus accumbens (NAc) J in depression. Given our previous characterization of Slc6a15 as a striatal dopamine receptor 2 (D2)-neuron-enriched gene, we examined the role of Slc6a15 in NAc D2-neurons in mediating susceptibility to stress in male mice. First, we showed that Slc6a15 mRNA was reduced in NAc of mice susceptible to chronic social defeat stress (CSDS), a paradigm that produces behavioral and molecular adaptations that resemble clinical depression. Consistent with our preclinical data, we observed Slc6a15 mRNA reduction in NAc of individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD). The Slc6a15 reduction in NAc occurred selectively in D2-neurons. Next, we used Cre-inducible viruses combined with D2-Cre mice to reduce or overexpress Slc6a15 in NAc D2-neurons. Slc6a15 reduction in D2-neurons caused enhanced susceptibility to a subthreshold social defeat stress (SSDS) as observed by reduced social interaction, while a reduction in social interaction following CSDS was not observed when Slc6a15 expression in D2-neurons was restored. Finally, since both D2-medium spiny neurons (MSNs) and D2-expressing choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) interneurons express Slc6a15, we examined Slc6a15 protein in these interneurons after CSDS. Slc6a15 protein was unaltered in ChAT interneurons. Consistent with this, reducing Slc5a15 selectively in NAc D2-MSNs, using A2A-Cre mice that express Cre selectively in D2-MSNs, caused enhanced susceptibility to SSDS. Collectively, our data demonstrate that reduced Slc6a15 in NAc occurs in MDD individuals and that Slc6a15 reduction in NAc D2-neurons underlies stress susceptibility.	[Chandra, Ramesh; Francis, T.

Disrupted hippocampal neuregulin-1/ErbB3 signaling and dentate gyrus granule cell alterations in suicide	TRANSLATIONAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Article							RECOMBINANT HUMAN NEUREGULIN-1; MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER; CHRONIC HEART-FAILURE; TEMPORAL CORTEX; MOOD DISORDERS; SCHIZOPHRENIA; ERBB3; BRAIN; NEUROGENESIS; STRESS	Neuregulin-1 (NRG1) and ErbB receptors have been associated with psychopathology, and NRG1-ErbB3 signaling has been shown to increase hippocampal neurogenesis and induce antidepressant-like effects. In this study, we aimed to determine whether deficits in NRG1 or ErbBs might be present in the hippocampus of suicide completers. In well-characterized postmortem hippocampal samples from suicides and matched sudden-death controls, we assessed gene expression and methylation using qRT-PCR and EpiTYPER, respectively. Moreover, in hippocampal tissues stained with cresyl violet, stereology was used to quantify numbers of granule cells and of glia. Granule cell body size was examined with a nucleator probe, and granule cell layer volume with a Cavalieri probe. Unmedicated suicides showed sharply decreased hippocampal ErbB3 expression and decreased numbers of ErbB3-expressing granule cell neurons in the anterior dentate gyrus; a phenomenon seemingly reversed by antidepressant treatment. Furthermore, we found ErbB3 expression to be significantly decreased in the dentate gyrus of adult mice exposed to chronic social defeat stress. Taken together, these results reveal novel suicidal endophenotypes in the hippocampus, as well as a putative etiological mechanism underlying suicidality, and suggest that antidepressant or NRG1 treatment may reverse a potential deficit in anterior dentate gyrus granule cell neurons in individuals at risk of dying by suicide.

The revised DLB consensus criteria now distinguish clearly between clinical features and diagnostic biomarkers, and give guidance about optimal methods to establish and interpret these. Substantial new information has been incorporated about previously reported aspects of DLB, with increased diagnostic weighting given to REM sleep behavior disorder and (123)iodine-metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) myocardial scintigraphy. The diagnostic role of other neuroimaging, electrophysiologic, and laboratory investigations is also described. Minor modifications to pathologic methods and criteria are recommended to take account of Alzheimer disease neuropathologic change, to add previously omitted Lewy-related pathology categories, and to include assessments for substantia nigra neuronal loss. Recommendations about clinical management are largely based upon expert opinion since randomized controlled trials in DLB are few. Substantial progress has been made since the previous report in the detection and recognition of DLB as a common and important clinical disorder. During that period it has been incorporated into DSM-5, as major neurocognitive disorder with Lewy bodies. There remains a pressing need to understand the underlying neurobiology and pathophysiology of DLB, to develop and deliver clinical trials with both symptomatic and disease-modifying agents, and to help patients and carers worldwide to inform themselves about the disease, its prognosis, best available treatments, ongoing research, and how to get adequate support.

The Affective Neuroscience Personality Scales (ANPS) assess their functioning. Using a person-centred approach of the ANPS, this study: (i) examined the existence of latent personality profiles, (ii) studied their gender invariance, (iii) assessed their longitudinal (4 years) stability, and (iv) explored how they relate to several intrapersonal, interpersonal, and emotion regulation skills. Latent Profile Analysis in 2 samples (Canadian, longitudinal, N = 520; French, cross-sectional, N = 830) found that, qualitatively, 3 profiles characterized both populations and genders, with one distinction for the second profile where the French women endorsed slightly higher and lower scores for, respectively, the negative and positive emotions. Whilst not being quantitatively similar across genders, the personality profiles remained consistent across time in the longitudinal sample. Associations between profiles and intrapersonal (e.g. depression), interpersonal (e.g. empathy), and emotion regulation skills measures (e.g. emotional intelligence) offered concurrent validity evidence. This person centred approach to ANPS offers a holistic and parsimonious way to study affective personality dimensions. It opens promising avenues for future studies on the predictive value of ANPS profiles, and for personalitytargeted interventions.

Subdivisions within the insula have been identified on the basis of cytoarchitectonics, sulcal landmarks, and connectivity. Depending on the parcellation technique used, the insula can be divided into anywhere between 2 and 13 distinct subdivisions. The insula subserves a wide variety of functions in humans ranging from sensory and affective processing to high-level cognition. Here, we provide a concise summary of known structural and functional features of the human insular cortex with a focus on lesion case studies and recent neuroimaging evidence for considerable functional heterogeneity of this brain region.

These criteria require a testing of their reliability in different prospective cohorts. Objectives: The objective was to evaluate the MDS prodromal PD criteria in 2 independent prospective studies. Methods: Prodromal PD probabilities of the Tubingen Evaluation of Risk Factors for Early Detection of Neurodegeneration cohort (TREND study, n=650, recruited by the presence of probable rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, depression, and/or hyposmia or none of these at baseline and 2-, 4-, and 6-year follow-up) and the population-based Prospective Evaluation of Risk Factors for Idiopathic Parkinson's Syndrome cohort (PRIPS Tubingen subsample; n=715, baseline and 3- and 5-year follow-up) were calculated. Baseline posttest probabilities, time to PD diagnosis, marker constellations, and longitudinal changes of prodromal PD probabilities were analyzed. Results: Incident PD cases (TREND, n = 10; PRIPS = 7) showed significantly higher likelihood ratios of risk and prodromal markers at baseline when compared with nonconverters. Only 2 of 17 incident PD cases met the criteria for probable prodromal PD (ie, posttest probability > 80%) and 5 had possible prodromal PD (ie, > 50%) 1.4 to 3.8 years before diagnosis. The criteria showed high specificity and negative predictive values (> 98%), but low sensitivity (TREND, 30%; PRIPS, 14%) and positive predictive values (TREND, 19%, PRIPS, 50%). The individual risk for prodromal PD in incident PD cases showed an inverse correlation with the time to conversion (Spearman rho=.80, P=.006) and unlike in nonconverters, increased during follow-up. Conclusion: The MDS prodromal criteria provide a practical framework for the calculation of prodromal PD risk. Although specificity of the criteria is high, most patients will not meet the criteria before diagnosis unless testing is thoroughly performed with numerous and highly specific markers objectively assessed.

Outcome comparison of different approaches to self-intermittent catheterization in neurogenic patients: a systematic review	SPINAL CORD			English	Review							CORD INJURED PATIENTS; HYDROPHILIC-COATED CATHETER; URINARY-TRACT-INFECTIONS; QUALITY-OF-LIFE; BLADDER DYSFUNCTION; LOFRIC CATHETER; RESIDUAL URINE; CROSSOVER; TRIAL; MEN	Study design: Systematic review (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA); http: //www.prisma-statement.org). Objectives: Different types of catheters and techniques have been described in the past three decades to identify the best self-intermittent catheterization method. Our aim is to review systematically the literature on the most appropriate material and technique to perform self-intermittent catheterization in the adult neurogenic population. Methods: A systematic review search was performed through PubMed/Medline, Embase and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) databases to study all types of self-intermittent catheters, and analyzing their impact on urinary tract infections (UTIs), urethral trauma, cost-effectiveness, quality of life and patient's satisfaction. We used the following keywords: 'intermittent catheterization/catheterisation', 'neurogenic', 'urinary catheters for intermittent use' and 'urethral catheterization/catheterisation' published by November 2015. Results: After screening 3768 articles, 31 were included in the final synthesis (level of evidence 1b to 2b). The 2188 trial participants were mainly spinal cord injury adults and women with multiple sclerosis. Hydrophilic-coated catheters tended to decrease the incidence of UTI as well as urethral trauma and improve patient's satisfaction when compared with non-hydrophilic-coated catheters. Similarly, prelubricated catheters were associated with better results in terms of patient satisfaction. Sterile technique seemed to decrease the incidence of recurrent UTI; however, these results are counter-balanced by significantly increasing cost compared with clean catheterization. Conclusions: The present review demonstrated advantages of hydrophilic-coated catheters in decreasing risk of UTI and urethral trauma as well as improving patient's satisfaction. Prelubricated catheters has been shown to be superior to conventional polyvinyl chloride catheters.

However, it is often challenging to validate these techniques with real clinical data due to the rarity of such publicly available repositories. Acquisition and validation methods: Pre-operative magnetic resonance images (MRI), and intra-operative ultrasound (US) scans were acquired from 23 patients with low-grade gliomas who underwent surgeries at St. Olavs University Hospital between 2011 and 2016. Each patient was scanned by Gadolinium-enhanced T1w and T2-FLAIR MRI protocols to reveal the anatomy and pathology, and series of B-mode ultrasound images were obtained before, during, and after tumor resection to track the surgical progress and tissue deformation. Retrospectively, corresponding anatomical landmarks were identified across US images of different surgical stages, and between MRI and US, and can be used to validate image registration algorithms. Quality of landmark identification was assessed with intra- and inter-rater variability. Data format and access: In addition to co-registered MRIs, each series of US scans are provided as a reconstructed 3D volume. All images are accessible in MINC2 and NIFTI formats, and the anatomical landmarks were annotated in MNI tag files. Both the imaging data and the corresponding landmarks are available online as the RESECT database at https://archive.norstore.no (search for "RESECT"). Potential impact: The proposed database provides real high-quality multi-modal clinical data to validate and compare image registration algorithms that can potentially benefit the accuracy and efficiency of brain tumor resection. Furthermore, the database can also be used to test other image processing methods and neuro-navigation software platforms.

First, areas activated more in stop-success (SS) than stop-failure (SF) included the lateral orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) extending into the inferior frontal gyrus (ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, BA 47/12), and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Second, the anterior cingulate and anterior insula (AI) were activated more on failure trials, specifically in SF versus SS. The interaction between brain region and SS versus SF activations was significant (P=5.6 * 10(-8)). The results provide new evidence from this "big data" investigation consistent with the hypotheses that the lateral OFC is involved in the stop-related processing that inhibits the action; that the DLPFC is involved in attentional processes that influence task performance; and that the AI and anterior cingulate are involved in emotional processes when failure occurs. The investigation thus emphasizes the role of the human lateral OFC BA 47/12 in changing behavior, and inhibiting behavior when necessary. A very similar area in BA47/12 is involved in changing behavior when an expected reward is not obtained, and has been shown to have high functional connectivity in depression.

Age-Related Mapping of Intracortical Myelin from Late Adolescence to Middle Adulthood Using T-1-Weighted MRI	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING			English	Article						intracortical myelin; aging; magnetic resonance imaging; cerebral cortex	PRIMARY VISUAL-CORTEX; IN-VIVO; WHITE-MATTER; HUMAN BRAIN; LIFE-SPAN; MYELOARCHITECTONIC ANALYSIS; T2-WEIGHTED MRI; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; CORTICAL AREAS; HUMAN STRIATE	Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies in humans have reported that the T-1-weighted signal in the cerebral cortex follows an inverted "U" trajectory over the lifespan. Here, we investigated the T-1-weighted signal trajectory from late adolescence to middle adulthood in humans to characterize the age range when mental illnesses tend to present, and efficacy of treatments are evaluated. We compared linear to quadratic predictors of age on signal in 67 healthy individuals, 17-45 years old. We investigated 1/4, 1/2, and 3/4 depths in the cortex representing intracortical myelin (ICM), in the superficial white matter (SWM), and in a reference deep white matter tract. We found that the quadratic fit was superior in all regions of the cortex, while signal in the SWM and deep white matter showed no global dependence on age over this range. The signal trajectory in any region followed a similar shape regardless of cortical depth. The quadratic fit was analyzed in 70 cortical regions to obtain the age of maximum signal intensity. We found that visual, cingulate, and left ventromedial prefrontal cortices peak first around 34 years old, whereas motor and premotor areas peak latest at similar to 38 years. Our analysis suggests that ICM trajectories over this range can be modeled well in small cohorts of subjects using quadratic functions, which are amenable to statistical analysis, thus suitable for investigating regional changes in ICM with disease. This study highlights a novel approach to map ICM trajectories using an age range that coincides with the onset of many mental illnesses. (C) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

However, the neural mechanisms involved in these social inferences are largely unknown. Employing functional magnetic resonance imaging, we examined the brain networks and individual differences underlying the evaluation of speaker believability from vocal expressions. Participants (n=26) listened to statements produced in a confident, unconfident, or "prosodically unmarked" (neutral) voice, and judged how believable the speaker was on a 4-point scale. We found frontal-temporal networks were activated for different levels of confidence, with the left superior and inferior frontal gyrus more activated for confident statements, the right superior temporal gyrus for unconfident expressions, and bilateral cerebellum for statements in a neutral voice. Based on listener's believability judgment, we observed increased activation in the right superior parietal lobule (SPL) associated with higher believability, while increased left posterior central gyrus (PoCG) was associated with less believability. A psychophysiological interaction analysis found that the anterior cingulate cortex and bilateral caudate were connected to the right SPL when higher believability judgments were made, while supplementary motor area was connected with the left PoCG when lower believability judgments were made. Personal characteristics, such as interpersonal reactivity and the individual tendency to trust others, modulated the brain activations and the functional connectivity when making believability judgments. In sum, our data pinpoint neural mechanisms that are involved when inferring one's believability from a speaker's voice and establish ways that these mechanisms are modulated by individual characteristics of a listener.

In order to obtain a comprehensive view on this disease, we have collected clinical and biochemical data as well as information on HMGCL mutations of 37 patients (35 families) from metabolic centers in Belgium, Germany, The Netherlands, Switzerland, and Turkey. All patients were symptomatic at some stage with 94% presenting with an acute metabolic decompensation. In 50% of the patients, the disorder manifested neonatally, mostly within the first days of life. Only 8% of patients presented after one year of age. Six patients died prior to data collection. Long-term neurological complications were common. Half of the patients had a normal cognitive development while the remainder showed psychomotor deficits. We identified seven novel HMGCL mutations. In agreement with previous reports, no clear genotype phenotype correlation could be found. This is the largest cohort of HMGCLD patients reported so far, demonstrating that HMGCLD is a potentially life-threatening disease with variable clinical outcome. Our findings suggest that the clinical course of HMGCLD cannot be predicted accurately from HMGCL genotype. The overall outcome in HMGCLD appears limited, thus rendering early diagnosis and strict avoidance of metabolic crises important. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

It is characterized by a complex anatomical architecture composed of numerous small nuclei, which mediate the involvement of the thalamus in a wide range of neurological functions. We present a novel framework for segmenting the thalamic nuclei, which explores the orientation distribution functions (ODFs) from diffusion magnetic resonance images at 3 T. The differentiation of the complex intra-thalamic microstructure is improved by using the spherical harmonic (SH) representation of the ODFs, which provides full angular characterization of the diffusion process in each voxel. The clustering was performed using the k-means algorithm initialized in a data-driven manner. The method was tested on 35 healthy volunteers and our results show a robust, reproducible and accurate segmentation of the thalamus in seven nuclei groups. Six of them closely matched the anatomy and were labeled as anterior, ventral anterior, medio-dorsal, ventral latero-ventral, ventral latero-dorsal and pulvinar, while the seventh cluster included the centro-lateral and the lateroposterior nuclei. Results were evaluated both qualitatively, by comparing the segmented nuclei to the histological atlas of Morel, and quantitatively, by measuring the clusters' extent and the clusters' spatial distribution across subjects and hemispheres. We also showed the robustness of our approach across different sequences and scanners, as well as intra-subject reproducibility of the segmented clusters using additional two scan-rescan datasets. We also observed an overlap between the path of the main long-connection tracts passing through the thalamus and the spatial distribution of the nuclei identified with our clustering algorithm. Our approach, based on SH representations of the ODFs, outperforms the one based on angular differences between the principle diffusion directions, which is considered so far as state-of-the-art method. Our findings show an anatomically reliable segmentation of the main groups of thalamic nuclei that could be of potential use in many clinical applications.

Here, we investigated whether beat perception might have its roots in the earliest stages of auditory cortical processing. Local field potentials were recorded from 8 patients implanted with depth-electrodes in Heschl's gyrus and the planum temporale (55 recording sites in total), usually considered as human primary and secondary auditory cortices. Using a frequency-tagging approach, we show that both low-frequency (<30 Hz) and high-frequency (>30 Hz) neural activities in these structures faithfully track auditory rhythms through frequency-locking to the rhythm envelope. A selective gain in amplitude of the response frequency-locked to the beat frequency was observed for the low-frequency activities but not for the high-frequency activities, and was sharper in the planum temporale, especially for the more challenging syncopated rhythm. Hence, this gain process is not systematic in all activities produced in these areas and depends on the complexity of the rhythmic input. Moreover, this gain was disrupted when the rhythm was presented at fast speed, revealing low-pass response properties which could account for the propensity to perceive a beat only within the musical tempo range. Together, these observations show that, even though part of these neural transforms of rhythms could already take place in subcortical auditory processes, the earliest auditory cortical processes shape the neural representation of rhythmic inputs in favor of the emergence of a periodic beat.

Long-term attention deficits combined with subcortical and cortical structural central nervous system alterations in young adults born small for gestational age	EARLY HUMAN DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Small for gestational age; Adults; Cerebral Mill; Voxel-based morphometry; FreeSurfer; Attention	LOW-BIRTH-WEIGHT; SURFACE-AREA; COGNITIVE FUNCTION; LATE ADOLESCENCE; BRAIN VOLUMES; CHILDREN; GROWTH; SEGMENTATION; MORPHOMETRY; THICKNESS	Background: Being born small for gestational age has been associated with neurodevelopmental disabilities and smaller gray matter volumes in childhood. However, it is not known if these changes persist in adults and whether SGA has any impact on attention memory and IQ. Aims: The goal of this study was to evaluate the association between birth weight and gray matter anatomy in adults born small for gestational age at term, in relation to IQ, attention and memory. Materials and methods: This prospective follow-up study at age 20 included 39 adults born small for gestational age at term and 37 adults born appropriate for gestational age at term. Detailed neurocognitive skills were assessed (IQ, attention and memory). Anatomical images were analyzed using Voxel-Based-Morphometry and FreeSurfer. Results: Adults born small for gestational age at term had lower performances in subtests assessing attention and executive functions. They also showed smaller total intracranial volume; smaller volumes and surface areas in the frontal lobe, inferior/middle parietal and temporal gyrus; smaller cerebellum, thalamus and basal ganglia volumes. Interestingly, all these structures correlated with attention subtests. Conclusion: These results highlight the persistent effects of being born small for gestational age on attention and associated brain structures.

This "JTC bias" may be a trait marker of the disease and may not improve with antipsychotic treatment. We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to test whether intranasal oxytocin could reduce JTC in stable, medicated patients with SCZ and healthy controls (HCs). We also explored whether striatal volume, clinical symptoms, and baseline social functioning (SF) was related to JTC performance. Methods: Forty-three male, medicated SCZ patients (Mean Age: 40.81 +/- 11.44) and sixteen HCs (Mean Age: 30.38 +/- 9.85) participated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study. Participants completed the Beads Task on two separate visits (minimum 20 days apart). Participants were randomized to receive either intranasal oxytocin (50IU in solution) or intranasal placebo (saline). Twenty of the SCZ patients and all sixteen HCs also provided Ti MRIs (3-T). Results: Patients with SCZ took fewer draws to decision (DTD) than HCs (t(57) = -2.78, p = 0.007). Oxytocin did not significantly change DTD in patients (t(42) = -1.11, p = 0.27-), nor in HCs (t(15) = -0.62, p = 0.55). Exploratory analyses found ventral caudate volumes were negatively correlated with DTD (r(18) = -0.50, p = 0.03) in patients. Moreover, oxytocin was more likely to improve JTC in patients with lower baseline SF. However, these exploratory findings did not survive correction for multiple comparisons. Conclusions: We replicate increased JTC in SCZ. However, acute intranasal oxytocin did not modify JTC. Future studies with larger samples should explore how brain morphology and SF are related to JTC performance in patients with SCZ.

A decrease in eukaryotic elongation factor 2 phosphorylation is required for local translation of sensorin and long-term facilitation in Aplysia	JOURNAL OF NEUROCHEMISTRY			English	Article						eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase; learning and memory; protein synthesis; S6 kinase; synaptic plasticity; target of rapamycin (TOR)	RAPAMYCIN-SENSITIVE MANNER; SYNAPTIC PLASTICITY; PROTEIN-SYNTHESIS; HETEROSYNAPTIC FACILITATION; S6 KINASE; COMPLEX 1; MEMORY; SEROTONIN; EEF2; NEURONS	Mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1)-dependent protein synthesis is required for many forms of synaptic plasticity and memory, but the downstream pathways important for synaptic plasticity are poorly understood. Longterm facilitation (LTF) in Aplysia is a form of synaptic plasticity that is closely linked to behavioral memory and an attractive model system for examining the important downstream targets for mTORC1 in regulating synaptic plasticity. Although mTORC1-regulated protein synthesis has been strongly linked to translation initiation, translation elongation is also regulated by mTORC1 and LTF leads to an mTORC1-dependent decrease in eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2) phosphorylation. The purpose of this study is to test the hypothesis that the decrease in eEF2 phosphorylation is required for mTORC1-dependent translation and plasticity. We show that the LTF-induced decrease in eEF2 phosphorylation is blocked by expression of an eEF2 kinase (eEF2K) modified to be resistant to mTORC1 regulation. We found that expression of this modified kinase blocked LTF. LTF requires local protein synthesis of the neuropeptide sensorin and importantly, local sensorin synthesis can be measured using a dendra fluorescent protein containing the 50 and 30 untranslated regions (UTRs) of sensorin. Using this construct, we show that blocking eEF2 dephosphorylation also blocks the increase in local sensorin synthesis. These results identify decreases in eEF2 phosphorylation as a critical downstream effector of mTOR required for long-term plasticity and identify an important translational target regulated by decreases in eEF2 phosphorylation.

Among multiple mediators of this `pathological connectivity' the role of extracellular vesicles (EVs) and their subsets (exosomes, ectosomes, oncosomes) is of particular interest for several reasons. The release of EVs from cancer cells represents a unique mechanism of regulated expulsion of bioactive molecules, a process that also mediates cell-to-cell transfer of lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids. Biological effects of these processes have been implicated in several aspects of cancer-related pathology, including tumour growth, invasion, angiogenesis, metastasis, immunity and thrombosis. Notably, the emerging evidence suggests that oncogenic mutations may impact several aspects of EV-mediated cell-cell communication including: (i) EV release rate and protein content; (ii) molecular composition of cancer EVs; (iii) the inclusion of oncogenic and mutant macromolecules in the EV cargo; (iv) EV-mediated release of genomic DNA; (v) deregulation of mechanisms responsible for EV biogenesis (vesiculome) and (vi) mechanisms of EV uptake by cancer cells. Intriguingly, EV-mediated intercellular transfer of mutant and oncogenic molecules between subpopulations of cancer cells, their indolent counterparts and stroma may exert profound biological effects that often resemble (but are not tantamount to) oncogenic transformation, including changes in cell growth, clonogenicity and angiogenic phenotype, or cause cell stress and death. However, several biological barriers likely curtail a permanent horizontal transformation of normal cells through EV-mediated mechanisms. The ongoing analysis and targeting of EV-mediated intercellular communication pathways can be viewed as a new therapeutic paradigm in cancer, while the analysis of oncogenic cargo contained in EVs released from cancer cells into biofluids is being developed for clinical use as a biomarker and companion diagnostics. Indeed, studies are underway to further explore the multiple links between molecular causality in cancer and various aspects of cellular vesiculation. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Zoomed MRI Guided by Combined EEG/MEG Source Analysis: A Multimodal Approach for Optimizing Presurgical Epilepsy Work-up and its Application in a Multi-focal Epilepsy Patient Case Study	BRAIN TOPOGRAPHY			English	Article						Combined EEG/MEG; Zoomed MRI; Epileptic activity; Source reconstruction; Realistic finite element head model; Skull conductivity calibration; Focal cortical dysplasia type IIb	FOCAL CORTICAL DYSPLASIA; EEG SOURCE ANALYSIS; ELECTRODE IMPLANTATION; EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY; INVERSE PROBLEM; HUMAN BRAIN; MEG; LOCALIZATION; HEAD; MAGNETOENCEPHALOGRAPHY	In recent years, the use of source analysis based on electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) has gained considerable attention in presurgical epilepsy diagnosis. However, in many cases the source analysis alone is not used to tailor surgery unless the findings are confirmed by lesions, such as, e.g., cortical malformations in MRI. For many patients, the histology of tissue resected from MRI negative epilepsy shows small lesions, which indicates the need for more sensitive MR sequences. In this paper, we describe a technique to maximize the synergy between combined EEG/MEG (EMEG) source analysis and high resolution MRI. The procedure has three main steps: (1) construction of a detailed and calibrated finite element head model that considers the variation of individual skull conductivities and white matter anisotropy, (2) EMEG source analysis performed on averaged interictal epileptic discharges (IED), (3) high resolution (0.5 mm) zoomed MR imaging, limited to small areas centered at the EMEG source locations. The proposed new diagnosis procedure was then applied in a particularly challenging case of an epilepsy patient: EMEG analysis at the peak of the IED coincided with a right frontal focal cortical dysplasia (FCD), which had been detected at standard 1 mm resolution MRI. Of higher interest, zoomed MR imaging (applying parallel transmission, 'ZOOMit') guided by EMEG at the spike onset revealed a second, fairly subtle, FCD in the left fronto-central region. The evaluation revealed that this second FCD, which had not been detectable with standard 1 mm resolution, was the trigger of the seizures.	[Aydin, Ue.; Wollbrink, A.; Wolters, C.

Understand the craniofacial dysmorphology associated with nonsyndromic craniosynostosis. 2. Understand the functional concerns and preoperative considerations when treating patients with nonsyndromic craniosynostosis. 3. Understand the various treatment options available to address patients with nonsyndromic craniosynostosis. 4. Recognize the current debate with regard to timing and type of surgical intervention, and their impact on patient outcome, for patients with nonsyndromic craniosynostosis. Summary: Craniosynostosis is a pathologic condition associated with the premature fusion of one or more cranial sutures. When the cranial sutures fuse prematurely, the skull and the growing brain beneath the suture are restricted, leading to a compensatory expansion into regions of the skull that are not affected. Craniosynostosis can occur in isolation (nonsyndromic) or can be associated with other extracranial anomalies. When anomalies outside the skull are present, craniosynostosis is often part of a syndrome and usually involves multiple sutures (syndromic craniosynostosis). This article focuses on nonsyndromic craniosynostosis, and describes the current state of knowledge regarding its diagnosis, surgical management, and outcomes.

Retinoblastoma and Neuroblastoma Predisposition and Surveillance	CLINICAL CANCER RESEARCH			English	Article							RAPID-ONSET OBESITY; CENTRAL HYPOVENTILATION SYNDROME; BECKWITH-WIEDEMANN SYNDROME; 2ND PRIMARY MALIGNANCIES; TP53 MUTATION CARRIERS; LI-FRAUMENI SYNDROME; LONG-TERM SURVIVORS; PINEAL-GLAND CYST; 2B PHOX2B GENE; HEREDITARY RETINOBLASTOMA	Retinoblastoma (RB) is the most common intraocular malignancy in childhood. Approximately 40% of retinoblastomas are hereditary and due to germline mutations in the RB1 gene. Children with hereditary RB are also at risk for developing a midline intracranial tumor, most commonly pineoblastoma. We recommend intensive ocular screening for patients with germline RB1 mutations for retinoblastoma as well as neuroimaging for pineoblastoma surveillance. There is an approximately 20% risk of developing second primary cancers among individuals with hereditary RB, higher among those who received radiotherapy for their primary RB tumors. However, there is not yet a clear consensus on what, if any, screening protocol would be most appropriate and effective. Neuroblastoma (NB), an embryonal tumor of the sympathetic nervous system, accounts for 15% of pediatric cancer deaths. Prior studies suggest that about 2% of patients with NB have an underlying genetic predisposition that may have contributed to the development of NB. Germline mutations in ALK and PHOX2B account for most familial NB cases. However, other cancer predisposition syndromes, such as Li-Fraumeni syndrome, RASopathies, and others, may be associated with an increased risk for NB. No established protocols for NB surveillance currently exist. Here, we describe consensus recommendations on hereditary RB and NB from the AACR Child hood Cancer Predisposition Workshop.

J	Mottron, L				Mottron, Laurent			Should we change targets and methods of early intervention in autism, in favor of a strengths-based education?	EUROPEAN CHILD & ADOLESCENT PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						Autism; Intelligence; Early intensive behavioral intervention; Autistic strengths	SPECTRUM DISORDER; BEHAVIORAL INTERVENTIONS; REPETITIVE BEHAVIORS; YOUNG-CHILDREN; ACQUISITION; PERCEPTION; ABILITIES; PATTERNS; LANGUAGE; IMPLICIT	Early intensive behavioral intervention (EIBI) and its recent variant, naturalist developmental behavioral intervention (NDBI) aim to increase socialization and communication, and to decrease repetitive and challenging behaviors in preschool age autistic children. These behaviorist techniques are based on the precocity and intensity of the intervention, face-to-face interaction, errorless learning, and information fragmentation. Once considered to be "scientifically proven", the efficacy of these approaches has been called into question in the last decade due to poor-quality data, small effects, low cost-efficiency, and the evolution of ethical and societal standards. Grounded on a reappraisal of the genetic and cognitive neuroscience of autism, we question three aspects of EIBI/NDBI: their focus on prerequisites for typical socio-communicative behaviors, their lack of consideration of autistic language development and learning modes, and their negative view of repetitive behaviors and restricted interests. We propose alternative predictions for empirical validation, based on the strengths of prototypical autistic children: (a) their non-verbal intelligence should be normally distributed and within the normal range; (b) improving access to non-communicative verbal and written auditory language material should favor their subsequent speech development and (c) decrease their problematic behavior; (d) lateral tutorship should increase the well-being of children and parents to a greater extent than personalized, face-to-face interventions by professionals; (e) admission to regular, but supervised daycare centers, combined with parental support and on-site crisis solving, represents a more cost-effective educational intervention than EIBI/NDBI.

The force pyramid: a spatial analysis of force application during virtual reality brain tumor resection	JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGERY			English	Article						force pyramid; Tier 3 performance metrics; virtual reality neurosurgical simulation; ergonomics; brain tumor resection; NeuroTouch; NeuroVR; surgical technique	ENDOSCOPIC SINUS SURGERY; MCGILL SIMULATOR; PERFORMANCE; NEUROTOUCH	OBJECTIVE Virtual reality simulators allow development of novel methods to analyze neurosurgical performance. The concept of a force pyramid is introduced as a Tier 3 metric with the ability to provide visual and spatial analysis of 3D force application by any instrument used during simulated tumor resection. This study was designed to answer 3 questions: 1) Do study groups have distinct force pyramids? 2) Do handedness and ergonomics influence force pyramid structure? 3) Are force pyramids dependent on the visual and haptic characteristics of simulated tumors? METHODS Using a virtual reality simulator, NeuroVR (formerly NeuroTouch), ultrasonic aspirator force application was continually assessed during resection of simulated brain tumors by neurosurgeons, residents, and medical students. The participants performed simulated resections of 18 simulated brain tumors with different visual and haptic characteristics. The raw data, namely, coordinates of the instrument tip as well as contact force values, were collected by the simulator. To provide a visual and qualitative spatial analysis of forces, the authors created a graph, called a force pyramid, representing force sum along the z-coordinate for different xy coordinates of the tool tip. RESULTS Sixteen neurosurgeons, 15 residents, and 84 medical students participated in the study. Neurosurgeon, resident and medical student groups displayed easily distinguishable 3D "force pyramid fingerprints." Neurosurgeons had the lowest force pyramids, indicating application of the lowest forces, followed by resident and medical student groups. Handedness, ergonomics, and visual and haptic tumor characteristics resulted in distinct well-defined 3D force pyramid patterns. CONCLUSIONS Force pyramid fingerprints provide 3D spatial assessment displays of instrument force application during simulated tumor resection. Neurosurgeon force utilization and ergonomic data form a basis for understanding and modulating resident force application and improving patient safety during tumor resection.

However, randomized and sham-controlled trials (RCTs) published to date have yielded heterogeneous clinical results and we have thus carried out the present systematic review and exploratory meta analysis of RCTs to evaluate this issue. We searched the literature for RCTs on TBS for MD from January 2001 through September 2016 using MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and CENTRAL. We then performed a random-effects meta-analysis with the main outcome measures including pre-post score changes in the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) as well as rates of response, remission and dropout. Data were obtained from 5 RCTs, totalling 221 subjects with MD. The pooled Hedges' g for pre-post change in HAM-D scores was 1.0 (p = 0.003), indicating a significant and large-sized difference in outcome favouring active TBS. Furthermore, active TBS was associated with significantly higher response rates when compared to sham TBS (35.6% vs. 17.5%, respectively; p = 0.005), although the groups did not differ in terms of rates of remission (18.6% vs. 10.7%, respectively; p = 0.1) and dropout (4.2% vs. 7.8%, respectively; p = 0.5). Finally, subgroup analyses indicated that bilateral TBS and unilateral intermittent TBS seem to be the most promising protocols. In conclusion, although TBS is a promising novel therapeutic intervention for MD, future studies should identify more clinically-relevant stimulation parameters as well as neurobiological predictors of treatment outcome, and include larger sample sizes, active comparators and longer follow-up periods.

Many of these algorithms rely on templates and atlases in a common coordinate space. Most freely available brain atlases are generated from relatively young individuals and not always derived from well-defined cohort studies. In this paper, we introduce a publicly available multi-spectral template with corresponding tissue probability atlases and regional atlases, optimised to use in studies of ageing cohorts (mean age 75 5 years).

Concentrations of DP (syn and anti isomers) are increasingly being reported in aquatic ecosystems worldwide. However, there is exceedingly little information on the exposure-related toxicity of DP in aquatic organisms, especially in bivalves. The objective of this study was to investigate the in vivo and in vitro effects of DP exposure on histopathology, lipid peroxidation (LPO) levels, cyclooxygenase (COX) activity, phagocytosis capacity and efficiency, and DNA strand breakage in the blue mussel (Mytilus edulis) following a 29 days exposure (0.001, 0.01, 0.1 and 1.0 mu g DP/L). Blue mussels accumulated DP in muscle and digestive gland in a dose-dependent manner. LPO levels in gills were found to increase by 82% and 67% at the 0.01 and 1.0 mu g DP/L doses, respectively, while COX activity in gills decreased by 44% at the 1 mu g/L dose. No histopathological lesion was found in gonads following DP exposure. Moreover, no change in hemocyte DNA strand breakage, phagocytosis rate, and viability was observed following DP exposure. Present study showed that toxicity of DP may occur primarily via oxidative stress in the blue mussel and potentially other bivalves, and that gills represent the most responsive tissue to this exposure.

Clinical criteria for subtyping Parkinson's disease: biomarkers and longitudinal progression	BRAIN			English	Article						Parkinson's disease; subtypes; biomarkers; neuroimaging; prognosis	SLEEP BEHAVIOR DISORDER; IDENTIFICATION; ASSOCIATION; DYSFUNCTION; FEATURES; NEURODEGENERATION; RECOMMENDATIONS; QUESTIONNAIRE; HETEROGENEITY; DIAGNOSIS	Parkinson's disease varies widely in clinical manifestations, course of progression and biomarker profiles from person to person. Identification of distinct Parkinson's disease subtypes is of great priority to illuminate underlying pathophysiology, predict progression and develop more efficient personalized care approaches. There is currently no clear way to define and divide subtypes in Parkinson's disease. Using data from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative, we aimed to identify distinct subgroups via cluster analysis of a comprehensive dataset at baseline (i.e. cross-sectionally) consisting of clinical characteristics, neuroimaging, biospecimen and genetic information, then to develop criteria to assign patients to a Parkinson's disease subtype. Four hundred and twenty-one individuals with de novo early Parkinson's disease were included from this prospective longitudinal multicentre cohort. Hierarchical cluster analysis was performed using data on demographic and genetic information, motor symptoms and signs, neuropsychological testing and other non-motor manifestations. The key classifiers in cluster analysis were a motor summary score and three non-motor features (cognitive impairment, rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder and dysautonomia). We then defined three distinct subtypes of Parkinson's disease patients: 223 patients were classified as 'mild motor-predominant' (defined as composite motor and all three non-motor scores below the 75th percentile), 52 as 'diffuse malignant' (composite motor score plus either 51/3 non-motor score 475th percentile, or all three non-motor scores 475th percentile) and 146 as ` intermediate'. On biomarkers, people with diffuse malignant Parkinson's disease had the lowest level of cerebrospinal fluid amyloid-b (329.0 +/- 96.7 pg/ml, P = 0.006) and amyloid-b/total-tau ratio (8.2 +/- 3.0, P = 0.032). Data from deformation-based magnetic resonance imaging morphometry demonstrated a Parkinson's disease-specific brain network had more atrophy in the diffuse malignant subtype, with the mild motor-predominant subtype having the least atrophy. Although disease duration at initial visit and follow-up time were similar between subtypes, patients with diffuse malignant Parkinson's disease progressed faster in overall prognosis (global composite outcome), with greater decline in cognition and in dopamine functional neuroimaging after an average of 2.7 years. In conclusion, we introduce new clinical criteria for subtyping Parkinson's disease based on a comprehensive list of clinical manifestations and biomarkers. This clinical subtyping can now be applied to individual patients for use in clinical practice using baseline clinical information. Even though all participants had a recent diagnosis of Parkinson's disease, patients with the diffuse malignant subtype already demonstrated a more profound dopaminergic deficit, increased atrophy in Parkinson's disease brain networks, a more Alzheimer's disease-like cerebrospinal fluid profile and faster progression of motor and cognitive deficits.

Four members of the Dlx homeobox gene family, Dlx1,2, 5 and 6, are involved in the specification of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic neurons in the vertebrate forebrain. Orthologous genes in mammals and teleost show similarities in expression patterns and transcriptional regulation mechanisms. We have used lineage tracing to permanently label dlx-expressing cells in the zebrafish and have characterized the progeny of these cells in the larva and in the juvenile and adult brain. We have found that dlx1a/2a and dlx5a/6a expressing progenitors give rise, for the most part, to small populations of cells which constitute only a small proportion of GABAergic cells in the adult brain tissue. Moreover, some of the cells do not acquire a neuronal phenotype suggesting that, regardless of the time a cell expresses dlx genes in the brain, it can potentially give rise to cells other than neurons. In some instances, labeling larval dlx5a/6a-expressing cells, but not dlx1a/2a-expressing cells, results in massively expanding, widespread clonal expansion throughout the adult brain. Our data provide a detailed lineage analysis of the dlx1a/2a and dlx5a/6a expressing progenitors in the zebrafish brain and lays the foundation for further characterization of the role of these transcription factors beyond the specification of GABAergic neurons.

There is recent evidence that men have higher density of synapses in temporal cortex than women. One consequence of these differences would be different rates of cortical energy turnover and blood flow in men and women. To test the hypotheses that rates of oxygen consumption (CMRO2) and cerebral blood flow are higher in men than in women in regions of cerebral cortex, and that the differences persist with aging, we used positron emission tomography to determine cerebral blood flow and cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen as functions of age in healthy volunteers of both sexes. Cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen did not change with age for either sex and there were no differences of mean values of cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen between men and women in cerebral cortex. Women had significant decreases of cerebral blood flow as function of age in frontal and parietal lobes. Young women had significantly higher cerebral blood flow than men in frontal and temporal lobes, but these differences had disappeared at age 65. The absent sex difference of cerebral energy turnover suggests that the known differences of synaptic density between the sexes are counteracted by opposite differences of individual synaptic activity.

The three types of words were processed similarly in the group of AD participants. In contrast, patients in the svPPA group were significantly more impaired at processing concrete words than abstract words, while comprehension of abstract emotional words was in between. VBM analyses showed that comprehension of concrete words relative to abstract words was significantly correlated with atrophy in the left anterior temporal lobe. These results support the view that concrete words are disproportionately impaired in svPPA, and that concrete and abstract words may rely upon partly dissociable brain regions.

Following the identification of many guidance cue molecules, recent experiments have focused on the interactions of their signaling cascades, which can be generally classified as additive or non-additive depending on the signal convergence point. While additive (parallel) signaling suggests limited molecular interaction between the pathways, non-additive signaling involves crosstalk between pathways and includes more complex synergistic, hierarchical, and permissive guidance cue relationships. Here the authors have attempted to classify recent studies that describe axon guidance signal integration according to these divisions. They also discuss the mechanistic implications of such interactions, as well as general ideas relating signal integration to the generation of diversity of axon guidance responses.

Heterogeneous Nuclear Ribonucleoprotein F Stimulates Sirtuin-1 Gene Expression and Attenuates Nephropathy Progression in Diabetic Mice	DIABETES			English	Article							COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT TEST; BRAIN INSULIN-RESISTANCE; CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; METABOLIC SYNDROME; VERBAL FLUENCY; INTRANASAL INSULIN; INCREASED RISK; OLDER-ADULTS; DEMENTIA	We investigated the mechanism of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein F (hnRNP F) renoprotective action in a type 2 diabetes (T2D) mouse model (db/db). Immortalized rat renal proximal tubular cells (IRPTCs) and kidneys from humans with T2D were also studied. The db/db mice developed hyperglycemia, oxidative stress, and nephropathy at age 20 weeks compared with their db/m littermates. These abnormalities, with the exception of hyperglycemia, were attenuated in db/db hnRNP F-transgenic (Tg) mice specifically overexpressing hnRNP F in their RPTCs. Sirtuin-1, Foxo3 alpha, and catalase expression were significantly decreased in RPTCs from db/db mice and normalized in db/db hnRNP F-Tg mice. In vitro, hnRNP F overexpression stimulated Sirtuin-1 and Foxo3 alpha with downregulation of acetylated p53 expression and prevented downregulation of Sirtuin-1 and Foxo3 alpha expression in IRPTCs by high glucose plus palmitate. Transfection of Sirtuin-1 small interfering RNA prevented hnRNP F stimulation of Foxo3 alpha and downregulation of acetylated p53 expression. hnRNP F stimulated Sirtuin-1 transcription via hnRNP F-responsive element in the Sirtuin-1 promoter. Human T2D kidneys exhibited more RPTC apoptosis and lower expression of hnRNP F, SIRTUIN-1, and Foxo3 alpha than nondiabetic kidneys. Our results demonstrate that hnRNP F protects kidneys against oxidative stress and nephropathy via stimulation of Sirtuin-1 expression and signaling in diabetes.

A Low-Frequency Inactivating AKT2 Variant Enriched in the Finnish Population Is Associated With Fasting Insulin Levels and Type 2 Diabetes Risk	DIABETES			English	Article							BETA-CELL MASS; NEUROTROPHIC FACTOR; GDNF FAMILY; GLUCOSE-HOMEOSTASIS; FATTY RAT; ZDF RATS; EXPRESSION; SECRETION; NEURTURIN; MELLITUS	To identify novel coding association signals and facilitate characterization of mechanisms influencing glycemic traits and type 2 diabetes risk, we analyzed 109,215 variants derived from exome array genotyping together with an additional 390,225 variants from exome sequence in up to 39,339 normoglycemic individuals from five ancestry groups. We identified a novel association between the coding variant (p.Pro50Thr) in AKT2 and fasting plasma insulin (FI), a gene in which rare fully penetrant mutations are causal for monogenic glycemic disorders. The low-frequency allele is associated with a 12% increase in FI levels. This variant is present at 1.1% frequency in Finns but virtually absent in individuals from other ancestries. Carriers of the FI-increasing allele had increased 2-h insulin values, decreased insulin sensitivity, and increased risk of type 2 diabetes (odds ratio 1.05). In cellular studies, the AKT2-Thr50 protein exhibited a partial loss of function. We extend the allelic spectrum for coding variants in AKT2 associated with disorders of glucose homeostasis and demonstrate bidirectional effects of variants within the pleckstrin homology domain of AKT2.

The probability of object-scene co-occurrence influences object identification processes	EXPERIMENTAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Object; Scene; Context; Probability; Event-related potentials	REAL-WORLD EVENTS; PARAHIPPOCAMPAL CORTEX; SEMANTIC INTEGRATION; LANGUAGE PERCEPTION; CONTEXT; RECOGNITION; MEMORY; COMPREHENSION; P300; ERPS	Contextual information allows the human brain to make predictions about the identity of objects that might be seen and irregularities between an object and its background slow down perception and identification processes. Bar and colleagues modeled the mechanisms underlying this beneficial effect suggesting that the brain stocks information about the statistical regularities of object and scene co-occurrence. Their model suggests that these recurring regularities could be conceptualized along a continuum in which the probability of seeing an object within a given scene can be high (probable condition), moderate (improbable condition) or null (impossible condition). In the present experiment, we propose to disentangle the electrophysiological correlates of these context effects by directly comparing object-scene pairs found along this continuum. We recorded the event-related potentials of 30 healthy participants (18-34 years old) and analyzed their brain activity in three time windows associated with context effects. We observed anterior negativities between 250 and 500 ms after object onset for the improbable and impossible conditions (improbable more negative than impossible) compared to the probable condition as well as a parieto-occipital positivity (improbable more positive than impossible). The brain may use different processing pathways to identify objects depending on whether the probability of co-occurrence with the scene is moderate (rely more on top-down effects) or null (rely more on bottom-up influences). The posterior positivity could index error monitoring aimed to ensure that no false information is integrated into mental representations of the world.

Early growth response-1-mediated down-regulation of drebrin correlates with loss of dendritic spines	JOURNAL OF NEUROCHEMISTRY			English	Article						dendritic spine; drebrin; Egr-1	LONG-TERM POTENTIATION; RESPONSE 1 EGR-1; MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; SYNAPTIC PLASTICITY; BINDING PROTEIN; GENE-EXPRESSION; TRANSCRIPTIONAL ACTIVATOR; POSTSYNAPTIC DENSITY-95; HIPPOCAMPAL-NEURONS	Post-synaptic dendritic spines are structurally composed of actin cytoskeleton, which undergoes dynamic morphological changes to accommodate incoming synaptic activity. Drebrin is an actin-binding protein highly expressed in dendritic spines that serves an important role in regulating spine morphology. Functionally, loss of drebrin directly correlates with deficits in learning and memory, as is the case observed in Alzheimer's disease. Despite these findings, the regulatory factor responsible for drebrin loss remains unclear. Here, we show that early growth response-1 (Egr-1), an inducible zinc finger transcription factor, down-regulates drebrin expression. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses identified Egr-1 binding sites upstream of the drebrin start site in neuronal cells. Over-expression of Egr-1 invitro in primary hippocampal neurons or invivo in homogenates prepared from the hippocampi of an inducible mouse model of Egr-1 show reduced drebrin mRNA and protein levels. Conversely, increased drebrin was detected in hippocampal samples isolated from Egr-1-deficient brain. These data demonstrate that Egr-1 interacts with the drebrin promoter and negatively regulates drebrin expression. Furthermore, immunocytochemical and Golgi staining analyses revealed reduced drebrin protein and dendritic spine density as well as reduced expression of synaptic markers in invitro hippocampal neurons over-expressing Egr-1 and invivo inducible mouse model of Egr-1. In contrast, increased drebrin expression correlated with increased dendritic spine density was detected in samples from Egr-1-deficient mice. These data provide evidence that Egr-1 is a novel regulator of drebrin expression, which is linked to changes in dendritic spine density.

Bruce			Field inhomogeneity correction for gradient echo myelin water fraction imaging	MAGNETIC RESONANCE IN MEDICINE			English	Article						myelin water; multicomponent T-2*; field inhomogeneities; gradient echo imaging	NMR RELAXATION DATA; IN-VIVO; MULTIPLE-SCLEROSIS; T-2-ASTERISK DECAY; T-2 RELAXATION; WHITE-MATTER; MAGNETIC-RESONANCE; PERIPHERAL-NERVE; BRAIN; MRI	PurposeRecently, the multi-echo gradient echo (MGRE) sequence has been proposed for multicomponent T2* (MC T2*) based myelin water fraction (MWF) mapping. This approach has appeal because it can provide fast whole-brain coverage, has low specific absorption rate, and short echo spacing. However, the MGRE signal requires correction for accurate MWF mapping, because of its sensitivity to magnetic field inhomogeneities (B-0). We propose a B-0 correction method for 2D MGRE data obtained for MWF mapping. Theory and MethodsLatter-echo MGRE data were fit to estimate B-0 gradients in the slice-select direction ( Gz). The decay signal was corrected for the effects of Gz, and MC T2* analysis was performed using nonnegative least-squares fitting. The method was evaluated using simulations and its performance demonstrated in healthy volunteers. ResultsSimulations showed that MWFs are significantly biased in the presence of Gz and that our correction method leads to accurate MWF estimates. In vivo MWF maps obtained from corrected data showed recovery of MWF estimates in areas of high B-0,B- and overall good agreement with literature values obtained with the reference MC T2-based method. ConclusionA new algorithm was presented for B-0 correction of 2D MGRE echo data acquired for MWF imaging. Simulations and in vivo data showed an improvement in MWF estimates.

However, there are no criteria to quantitatively evaluate different processing methods, to properly use the new sequence. MethodsWe evaluated different processing steps of this new sequence under the common generalized linear model (GLM) framework by assessing the reliability of results. A bootstrap sampling technique was first used to generate multiple replicated data sets; a GLM with different processing steps was then applied to obtain activation maps, and the reliability of these maps was assessed. ResultsWe applied our analysis in an event-related GLM related to IEDs. A higher reliability was achieved by using a GLM with head motion confound regressor with 24 components rather than the usual 6, with an autoregressive model of order 5 and with a canonical hemodynamic response function (HRF) rather than variable latency or patient-specific HRFs. Comparison of activation with IED field also favored the canonical HRF, consistent with the reliability analysis. ConclusionThe reliability analysis helps to optimize the processing methods for this fast fMRI sequence, in a context in which we do not know the ground truth of activation areas.

J	Boswell, P				Boswell, Paul			Neuroethics and the Scientific Revision of Common Sense	NEUROETHICS			English	Book Review						Folk psychology; Eliminativism; Narrative identity; Cognitive enhancement; Death; David Lewis	MEMORY; BRAIN; DEATH	This ambitious book aims to make a substantive contribution to six separate debates within neuroethics - the existence of free will, the impact of cognitive enhancement and (separately) of memory management on personal identity, the nature of mental privacy, the supposed subjectivity of pain, and the proper definition of death - all in the context of a framing argument concerning the relation between common sense psychological concepts and scientific concepts. Gligorov means to rebut skepticism about folk mental states in the face of surprising neuroscientific results by reconceptualizing folk theories as protean, incorporating some of the very results that seem to challenge them. My impression is that Gligorov's arguments on cognitive enhancement, memory modification, and brain death make helpful contributions to the respective literatures on those subjects, but I close with a number of concerns about the book, especially whether its framing argument is successful in its current form.

Moreover, both processes activate similar brain regions within the parietal cortex, in particular, the intraparietal sulcus; however, it is still unclear whether the neuronal underpinnings of VSTM directly correlate with mathematical operation and reasoning abilities. The main objective was to investigate the association between parieto-occipital brain activity during the retention period of a VSTM task and performance in mathematics. Method: The authors measured mathematical abilities and VSTM capacity as well as brain activity during memory maintenance using magnetoencephalography (MEG) in 19 healthy adult participants. Event-related magnetic fields (ERFs) were computed on the MEG data. Linear regressions were used to estimate the strength of the relation between VSTM related brain activity and mathematical abilities. Results: The amplitude of parieto-occipital cerebral activity during the retention of visual information was related to performance in 2 standardized mathematical tasks: mathematical reasoning and calculation fluency. Conclusions: The findings show that brain activity during retention period of a VSTM task is associated with mathematical abilities. Contributions of VSTM processes to numerical cognition should be considered in cognitive interventions.

The RNA splicing process is facilitated by the spliceosome, a large RNA-protein complex consisting of small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs), and many other proteins, such as heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs). The HNRNPU gene (OMIM *602869) encodes the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein U, which plays a crucial role in mammalian development. HNRNPU is expressed in the fetal brain and adult heart, kidney, liver, brain, and cerebellum. Microdeletions in the 1q44 region encompassing HNRNPU have been described in patients with intellectual disability (ID) and other clinical features, such as seizures, corpus callosum abnormalities (CCA), and microcephaly. Recently, pathogenic HNRNPU variants were identified in large ID and epileptic encephalopathy cohorts. In this study, we provide detailed clinical information of five novels and review two of the previously published individuals with (likely) pathogenic de novo variants in the HNRNPU gene including three non-sense and two missense variants, one small intragenic deletion, and one duplication. The phenotype in individuals with variants in HNRNPU is characterized by early onset seizures (6/7), severe ID (6/6), severe speech impairment (6/6), hypotonia (6/7), and central nervous system (CNS) (5/6), cardiac (4/6), and renal abnormalities (3/4). In this study, we broaden the clinical and mutational HNRNPU-associated spectrum, and demonstrate that heterozygous HNRNPU variants cause epilepsy, severe ID with striking speech impairment and variable CNS, cardiac, and renal anomalies.

Forecasting effective drought index using a wavelet extreme learning machine (W-ELM) model	STOCHASTIC ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND RISK ASSESSMENT			English	Article						Wavelet; Extreme learning machine; Drought model; Effective drought index; Forecasting	ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORK; SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; DATA-PREPROCESSING TECHNIQUES; ANNUAL TEMPERATURE DATASET; ESTIMATING SOLAR-RADIATION; INPUT VARIABLE SELECTION; DAILY PAN EVAPORATION; TIME-SERIES; REFERENCE EVAPOTRANSPIRATION; STANDARDIZED PRECIPITATION	A drought forecasting model is a practical tool for drought-risk management. Drought models are used to forecast drought indices (DIs) that quantify drought by its onset, termination, and subsequent properties such as the severity, duration, and peak intensity in order to monitor and evaluate the impacts of future drought. In this study, a wavelet-based drought model using the extreme learning machine (W-ELM) algorithm where the input data are first screened through the wavelet pre-processing technique for better accuracy is developed to forecast the monthly effective DI (EDI). The EDI is an intensive index that considers water accumulation with a weighting function applied to rainfall data with the passage of time in order to analyze the drought-risk. Determined by the autocorrelation function (ACF) and partial ACFs, the lagged EDI signals for the current and past months are used as significant inputs for 1 month lead-time EDI forecasting. For drought model development, 97 years of data for three hydrological stations (Bathurst Agricultural, Wilsons Promontory and Merredin in Australia) are partitioned in approximately 90:5:5 ratios for training, cross-validation and test purposes, respectively. The discrete wavelet transformation (DWT) is applied to the predictor datasets to decompose inputs into their time-frequency components that capture important information on periodicities. DWT sub-series are used to develop new EDI sub-series as inputs for the W-ELM model. The forecasting capability of W-ELM is benchmarked with ELM, artificial neural network (ANN), least squares support vector regression (LSSVR) and their wavelet-equivalent (W-ANN, W-LSSVR) models. Statistical metrics based on agreement between the forecasted and observed EDI, including the coefficient of determination, Willmott's index, Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient, percentage peak deviation, root-mean-square error, mean absolute error, and model execution time are used to assess the effectiveness of the models. The results demonstrate enhanced forecast skill of the drought models that use wavelet pre-processing of the predictor dataset. Based on statistical measures, W-ELM outperformed traditional ELM, LSSVR, ANN and their wavelet-equivalent counterparts (W-ANN, W-LSSVR). It is found that the W-ELM model is computationally efficient as shown by a faster running time with the majority of forecasting errors in lower frequency bands. The results demonstrate the usefulness of W-ELM over W-ANN and W-LSSVR models and the benefits of wavelet transformation of input data to improve the performance of drought forecasting models.

GRIN2B encephalopathy: novel findings on phenotype, variant clustering, functional consequences and treatment aspects	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL GENETICS			English	Article							DE-NOVO MUTATIONS; AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDERS; INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY; NEURODEVELOPMENTAL DISORDERS; NMDA RECEPTORS; FOCAL EPILEPSY; SUBUNIT; GENES; INDIVIDUALS; MIGRATION	Background We aimed for a comprehensive delineation of genetic, functional and phenotypic aspects of GRIN2B encephalopathy and explored potential prospects of personalised medicine. Methods Data of 48 individuals with de novo GRIN2B variants were collected from several diagnostic and research cohorts, as well as from 43 patients from the literature. Functional consequences and response to memantine treatment were investigated in vitro and eventually translated into patient care. Results Overall, de novo variants in 86 patients were classified as pathogenic/likely pathogenic. Patients presented with neurodevelopmental disorders and a spectrum of hypotonia, movement disorder, cortical visual impairment, cerebral volume loss and epilepsy. Six patients presented with a consistent malformation of cortical development (MCD) intermediate between tubulinopathies and polymicrogyria. Missense variants cluster in transmembrane segments and ligand-binding sites. Functional consequences of variants were diverse, revealing various potential gain-of-function and loss-of-function mechanisms and a retained sensitivity to the use-dependent blocker memantine. However, an objectifiable beneficial treatment response in the respective patients still remains to be demonstrated. Conclusions In addition to previously known features of intellectual disability, epilepsy and autism, we found evidence that GRIN2B encephalopathy is also frequently associated with movement disorder, cortical visual impairment and MCD revealing novel phenotypic consequences of channelopathies.

FORGE Canada Consortium Canadian R	A truncating mutation in CEP55 is the likely cause of MARCH, a novel syndrome affecting neuronal mitosis	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL GENETICS			English	Article							CENTROSOMAL PROTEIN; KINASE 1; CYTOKINESIS; ABSCISSION; MIDBODY; ZEBRAFISH; PATHWAY; RECRUITMENT; MECHANISMS; STABILITY	Background Hydranencephaly is a congenital anomaly leading to replacement of the cerebral hemispheres with a fluid-filled cyst. The goals of this work are to describe a novel autosomal-recessive syndrome that includes hydranencephaly (multinucleated neurons, anhydramnios, renal dysplasia, cerebellar hypoplasia and hydranencephaly (MARCH)); to identify its genetic cause (s) and to provide functional insight into pathomechanism. Methods We used homozygosity mapping and exome sequencing to identify recessive mutations in a single family with three affected fetuses. Immunohistochemistry, RT-PCR and imaging in cell lines, and zebrafish models, were used to explore the function of the gene and the effect of the mutation. Results We identified a homozygous nonsense mutation in CEP55 segregating with MARCH. Testing the effect of this allele on patient-derived cells indicated both a reduction of the overall CEP55 message and the production of a message that likely gives rise to a truncated protein. Suppression or ablation of cep55l in zebrafish embryos recapitulated key features of MARCH, most notably renal dysplasia, cerebellar hypoplasia and craniofacial abnormalities. These phenotypes could be rescued by full-length but not truncated human CEP55 message. Finally, we expressed the truncated form of CEP55 in human cells, where we observed a failure of truncated protein to localise to the midbody, leading to abscission failure and multinucleated daughter cells. Conclusions CEP55 loss of function mutations likely underlie MARCH, a novel multiple congenital anomaly syndrome. This association expands the involvement of centrosomal proteins in human genetic disorders by highlighting a role in midbody function.

Special Commentary: Early Clinical Development of Cell Replacement Therapy: Considerations for the National Eye Institute Audacious Goals Initiative	OPHTHALMOLOGY			English	Article							RETINAL GANGLION-CELLS; PLURIPOTENT STEM-CELLS; AXON REGENERATION; OPTIC-NERVE; INFORMED-CONSENT; DIFFERENTIATION; PHOTORECEPTORS; TRANSPLANTATION; RESTORATION; GLAUCOMA	The National Eye Institute launched the Audacious Goals Initiative (AGI) in 2013 with the aim "to restore vision through the regeneration of neurons and neural connections in the eye and visual system." An AGI Town Hall held at the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology Annual Meeting in 2016 brought together basic, translational, and clinical scientists to address the clinical implications of the AGI, with a particular emphasis on diseases amenable to regenerative medicine and strategies to deal with barriers to progess. An example of such a barrier is that replacement of lost neurons may be insufficient because damage to other neurons and non-neuronal cells is common in retinal and optic nerve disease. Reparative processes such as gliosis and fibrosis also can make it difficult to replenish and regenerate neurons. Other issues include choice of animal models, selecting appropriate endpoints, ethics of informed consent, and regulatory issues. Another area critical to next steps in the AGI is the choice of target diseases and the stage at which early development studies should be focused. For example, an advantage of doing clinical trials in patients with early disease is that supporting cellular and structural constituents are still likely to be present. However, regenerative studies in patients with late disease make it easier to detect the effects of replacement therapy against the background of severe visual loss, whereas it may be harder to detect incremental improvement in visual function in those with early disease and considerable remaining visual function. Achieving the goals of the AGI also requires preclinical advances, new imaging techniques, and optimizing translational issues. The work of the AGI is expected to take at least 10 years but should eventually result in therapies to restore some degree of vision to the blind. (C) 2017 by the American Academy of Ophthalmology.

Using a rat model of EOP, we investigated whether neonatal HI of the brain may alter the expression of cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) and the components of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling. We performed unilateral carotid ligation and induced HI (UCL/HI) in Long-Evans rats at P6 and found increased CBS expression in white matter (i.e. corpus callosum, cingulum bundle and external capsule) as early as 24 h (P7) postprocedure. CBS remained elevated through P21, and, to a lesser extent, at P40. The mTOR downstream target 70 kDa ribosomal protein S6 kinase (p70S6K and phospho-p70S6K) and 40S ribosomal protein S6 (S6 and phospho-S6) were also overexpressed at the same time points in the UCL/HI rats compared to healthy controls. Overexpression of mTOR components was not observed in rats treated with the mTOR inhibitor everolimus. Behavioral assays performed on young rats (postnatal day 35-37) following UCL/HI at P6 indicated impaired preference for social novelty, a behavior relevant to autism spectrum disorder, and hyperactivity. Everolimus restored behavioral patterns to those observed in healthy controls. A gait analysis has shown that motor deficits in the hind paws of UCL/HI rats were also significantly reduced by everolimus. Our results suggest that neonatal HI brain injury may inflict long-term damage by upregulation of CBS and mTOR signaling. We propose this cascade as a possible new molecular target for EOP-a still untreatable cause of autism, hyperactivity and cerebral palsy.

Prenatal infection leads to ASD-like behavior and altered synaptic pruning in the mouse offspring	BRAIN BEHAVIOR AND IMMUNITY			English	Article						LPS; Microglia; Maternal immune activation; ASD; Synaptic pruning; Fractalkine; Complement components	MATERNAL IMMUNE ACTIVATION; AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER; BRAIN-DEVELOPMENT; ANIMAL-MODELS; INBRED STRAINS; MICROGLIA; MICE; CYTOKINES; INFLAMMATION; PREGNANCY	Environmental challenges to the maternal immune system during pregnancy have been associated with an increase in the frequency of neurodevelopmental disorders such as Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) appearing in the offspring. Microglia, the brain's resident immune-cells, are now known to be critically involved in normal brain development, shaping connections between neurons by pruning superfluous synaptic spines. Our aim was to investigate whether maternal infection during critical stages of gestation compromises the role of microglia in sculpting neuronal circuits. Using a mouse model of maternal immune activation (MIA) induced by bacterial Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), we assayed the offspring's behavior during postnatal development. Additionally, we quantified spines within the offspring's brain and assessed alterations in some molecular signals involved in pruning. LPS-induced MIA led to behavioral changes relevant to ASD in the offspring in the absence of gross neurological problems. Prenatal LPS resulted in a significant increase in the number of spines in the granule cells of the dentate gyrus, as well as a reduction in hippocampal expression of the fractalkine microglial receptor (CX3CR1), involved in mediating the pruning process in the offspring. Interestingly, these changes were only noted in the male progeny of the LPS challenged dams. These results provide an early indicator that microglial function is altered in the brain of offspring from immune challenged mothers and that the effects in the brain appear to be specific along sex lines.

Evidence suggests that abnormal KYNA levels are involved in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. However, this has never been assessed through a meta-analysis. A literature search was conducted through Ovid using Embase, Medline, and PsycINFO databases (last search: December 2016) with the search terms: (kynuren* or KYNA) and (schizophreni* or psychosis). English language studies measuring KYNA levels using any method in patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls (HCs) were identified. Standardized mean differences (SMDs) were calculated to determine differences in KYNA levels between groups. Subgroup analyses were separately performed for nonoverlapping participant samples, KYNA measurement techniques, and KYNA sample source. The influences of patients' age, antipsychotic status (% medicated), and sex (% male) on study SMDs were assessed through a meta-regression. Thirteen studies were deemed eligible for inclusion in the meta-analysis. In the main analysis, KYNA levels were elevated in the patient group. Subgroup analyses demonstrated that KYNA levels were increased in nonoverlapping participant samples, and centrally (cerebrospinal fluid and brain tissue) but not peripherally. Patients' age, % medicated, and % male were each positively associated with study SMDs. Overall, KYNA levels are increased in patients with schizophrenia, specifically within the central nervous system. An improved understanding of KYNA in patients with schizophrenia may contribute to the development of novel diagnostic approaches and therapeutic strategies.

During the time it takes for the memory to restabilize (reconsolidate) the memory can either be reduced by an amnesic agent or enhanced by memory enhancers. The change in memory expression is related to changes in the brain correlates of long-term memory. Many have suggested that such retrieval-induced plasticity is ideally placed to enable memories to be updated with new information. This hypothesis has been tested experimentally, with a translational perspective, by attempts to update maladaptive memories to reduce their problematic impact. We review here progress on reconsolidation updating studies, highlighting their translational exploitation and addressing recent challenges to the reconsolidation field.	[Lee, Jonathan L.

Whereas participants in most behavioral and EEG experiments sit upright, many prominent brain imaging techniques (e.g., fMRI) require participants to lie supine. Here we demonstrate that physical comportment profoundly alters baseline brain activity as measured by magnetoencephalography (MEG)an imaging modality that permits multipostural acquisition. We collected resting-state MEG data from 12 healthy participants in three postures (lying supine, reclining at 45 degrees, and sitting upright). Source-modeling analysis revealed a broadly distributed influence of posture on resting brain function. Sitting upright versus lying supine was associated with greater high-frequency (i.e., beta and gamma) activity in widespread parieto-occipital cortex. Moreover, sitting upright and reclining postures correlated with dampened activity in prefrontal regions across a range of bandwidths (i.e., from alpha to low gamma). The observed effects were large, with a mean Cohen's d of 0.95 (SD = 0.23). In addition to neural activity, physiological parameters such as muscle tension and eye blinks may have contributed to these posture-dependent changes in brain signal. Regardless of the underlying mechanisms, however, the present results have important implications for the acquisition and interpretation of multimodal imaging data (e.g., studies combining fMRI or PET with EEG or MEG). More broadly, our findings indicate that generalizing resultsfrom supine neuroimaging measurements to erect positions typical of ecological human behaviorwould call for considering the influence that posture wields on brain dynamics.

ELEGANS; OXIDATIVE STRESS; ACETYLCHOLINE-RELEASE; ANTICHOLINERGIC DRUGS; ENVIRONMENTAL-FACTORS; AXONAL GUIDANCE; NERVOUS-SYSTEM	Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is the most common neurodevelopmental disorder with a constantly increasing prevalence. Model organisms may be tools to identify underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms, as well as aid the discovery and development of novel therapeutic approaches. A simple animal such as the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans may provide insights into the extreme complexity of ASD genetics. Despite its potential, using C.elegans in ASD research is a controversial approach and has not yet been used extensively in this context. In this study, we present a screening approach of potential C.elegans mutants as potential ASD models. We screened these mutants for motor -deficiency phenotypes, which can be exploited to study underlying mechanisms of the disorder. Selected motor-deficient mutants were then used in a comprehensive drug screen of over 3900 compounds, including many FDA-approved and natural molecules, that were analyzed for their ability to suppress motility defects caused by ASD-associated gene orthologues. This genetic-chemical approach, i.e. establishing C elegans models for ASD and screening of a well-characterized compound library, might be a promising first step to understand the mechanisms of how gene variations cause neuronal dysfunction, leading to ASD and other neurological disorders. Positively acting compounds could also be promising candidates for preclinical studies. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	[Schmeisser, Kathrin; Fardghassemi, Yasmin; Parker, J.

Increasing evidence implicates that neurodegeneration is a component of schizophrenia pathology and some atypical antipsychotics are neuroprotective and successful in slowing the progressive morphological brain changes. As an antipsychotic agent, clozapine has superior and unique effects, but the intracellular signaling pathways that mediate clozapine action remain to be elucidated. The phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/protein kinase B/Forkhead box O3 (PI3K/Akt/FoxO3a) pathway is crucial for neuronal survival. However, little information is available regarding this pathway with clozapine. In the present study, we investigated the protective effect of clozapine on the PC12 cells against corticosterone toxicity. Our results showed that corticosterone decreases the phosphorylation of Akt and FoxO3a, leading to the nuclear localization of FoxO3a and the apoptosis of PC12 cells, while clozapine concentration dependently protected PC12 cells against corticosterone insult. Pathway inhibitors studies displayed that the protective effect of clozapine was reversed by LY294002 and wortmannin, two PI3K inhibitors, or Akt inhibitor VIII although several other inhibitors had no effect. The shRNA knockdown results displayed that downregulated Akt1 or FoxO3a attenuated the protective effect of clozapine. Western blot analyses revealed that clozapine induced the phosphorylation of Akt and FoxO3a by the PI3K/Akt pathway and reversed the reduction of the phosphorylated Akt and FoxO3a and the nuclear translocation of FoxO3a evoked by corticosterone. Together, our data indicates that clozapine protects PC12 cells against corticosterone-induced cell death by modulating activity of the PI3K/Akt/FoxO3a pathway.

To further our understanding of the interactions of Hg and Cd with different lipid structures under physiologically relevant chloride and pH conditions (100 mM NaCl pH 7.4), we used fluorescence spectroscopy and dynamic light scattering to monitor changes in membrane fluidity and phase transition and liposome size. The metal effects were studied on zwitterionic, cationic and anionic lipids to elucidate electrostatically driven metal-lipid interactions. The effect of Hg-catalyzed cleavage of the vinyl ether bond in plasmalogens on these aforementioned properties was studied in addition to a thermodynamic characterization of this interaction by Isothermal Titration Calorimetry. The negatively charged Hg-chloride complexes formed under our experimental conditions induce membrane rigidity in membranes containing cationic lipids and plasmalogens while this effect is heavily reduced and entirely absent with zwitterionic and anionic lipids respectively. The K-D for the interaction of Hg with plasmalogen containing liposomes was between 4-30 mu M. Furthermore, the presence of Cd affected the interaction of Hg with plasmalogen when negatively charged PS was also present. In this case, even the order of the metal addition was important.

Clusterin (Apo J) is one of the major risk factors for sporadic form of AD. Clusterin binds to A beta and prevents A beta aggregation. In addition, clusterin promotes A beta degradation and accelerates A beta clearance from the brain. Clusterin thus protects neurons from A beta and loss of clusterin level in the brain is implicated as promoting AD pathology. In this study, we found that the level of clusterin protein but not mRNA is reduced in the brains of 3xTg-AD mice. When rat hippocampal primary neurons were treated with A beta 1-42, level of clusterin protein but not mRNA was downregulated. A beta 1-42 induced downregulation of clusterin was blocked by lysosome inhibitors bafilomycin Al and ammonium chloride. In neurons, A beta 1-42 induced expression of sortilin, a lysosomal sorting protein that targets proteins to lysosome for degradation. In BE(2) M17 human neuroblastoma cells, clusterin bound to sortilin and when sortilin expression was silenced, A beta-42-induced clusterin downregulation was almost completely blocked. Our data demonstrate that in neurons, A beta 1-42 promotes lysosomal degradation of clusterin by inducing expression of sortilin and provide a novel mechanism by which Ala promotes AD pathogenesis.

Expression of the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) driven by the second intron of the nestin gene identified a subpopulation of EGFP/nestin((+)) cells that differentiated to a vascular phenotype in the peri-infarct/infarct region of post-MI mice albeit the transgene was not detected in nestin((+))-cardiomyocytes. -MHC-driven expression of the reporter mCherry was detected in troponin-T(+)- and nestin((+))-cardiomyocytes in the peri-infarct/infarct region of post-MI mice. However, the cell cycle re-entry of nestin/mCherry((+))-cardiomyocytes was not observed. Nestin staining was identified in a paucity of neonatal rat ventricular cardiomyocytes (NNVM). Exposure to phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu) induced NNVM hypertrophy but did not promote nestin expression or Brdu incorporation. PDBu treatment of NNVMs phosphorylated p38 MAPK and HSP27 and HSP27 phosphorylation was abrogated by the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580. PDBu/SB203580 co-treatment significantly increased the percentage of NNVMs that expressed nestin and incorporated Brdu. In the heart of embryonic 10.5day mice, nestin immunoreactivity was observed in cycling troponin-T(+)-cardiomyocytes. Nestin was also detected in embryonic rat ventricular cardiomyocytes and depletion of the intermediate filament protein attenuated cell cycle re-entry. Thus, nestin expressed by pre-existing cardiomyocytes following ischemic damage recapitulated in part an embryonic trait and may provide the requisite phenotype to initiate cell cycle re-entry. However, the overt activation of the p38 MAPK pathway post-MI may in part limit the appearance and inhibit the cell cycle re-entry of nestin((+))-cardiomyocytes. J. Cell.

J	Rauch, F				Rauch, Frank			The brains of the bones: how osteocytes use WNT1 to control bone formation	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL INVESTIGATION			English	Editorial Material							EARLY-ONSET OSTEOPOROSIS; OSTEOGENESIS IMPERFECTA; MUTATIONS; FRAGILITY	WNT proteins drive the development and maintenance of many tissues, including bone. It is less clear which of the many WNT proteins act on bone or where these WNTs act in the skeleton; however, loss-of-function mutations in WNT1 cause bone fragility in children and adults. In this issue of the JCI, Joeng and colleagues demonstrate that bone formation is under the control of WNT1 produced by osteocytes, the cells that reside deep in the bone matrix and form dendritic networks. The implication of WNT1 in the control of bone formation identifies a potential new target for the treatment of low bone mass disorders, such as osteoporosis.

Numerous techniques and tools have been established to help overcome these cognitive biases in various disciplines ranging from neuroscience to design sciences. Several works in the developmental cognitive sciences have discussed the importance of inhibitory control and have argued that individuals must first inhibit the spontaneous ideas that come to their mind so that they can generate creative solutions to problems. In line with the above discussions, in the present study, we performed an experiment on one hundred undergraduates from the Faculty of Psychology at Paris Descartes University, in which we investigated a minimal executive feedback-based learning process that helps individuals inhibit intuitive paths to solutions and then gradually drive their ideation paths toward creativity. Our results provide new insights into novel forms of creative leadership for idea generation.

Network Efficiency and Posterior Alpha Patterns Are Markers of Recovery from General Anesthesia: A High-Density Electroencephalography Study in Healthy Volunteers	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						consciousness; cognition; general anesthesia; electroencephalography; alpha rhythm; graph theory	SEVOFLURANE-INDUCED UNCONSCIOUSNESS; PROPOFOL-INDUCED LOSS; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; BRAIN NETWORKS; CONSCIOUSNESS; ORGANIZATION; EEG; RECONFIGURATION; SLEEP; DYNAMICS	Recent studies have investigated local oscillations, long-range connectivity, and global network patterns to identify neural changes associated with anesthetic-induced unconsciousness. These studies typically employ anesthetic protocols that either just cross the threshold of unconsciousness, or induce deep unconsciousness for a brief period of time-neither of which models general anesthesia for major surgery. To study neural patterns of unconsciousness and recovery in a clinically-relevant context, we used a realistic anesthetic regimen to induce and maintain unconsciousness in eight healthy participants for 3 h. High-density electroencephalogram (EEG) was acquired throughout and for another 3 h after emergence. Seven epochs of 5-min eyes-closed resting states were extracted from the data at baseline as well as 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, and 180-min post-emergence. Additionally, 5-min epochs were extracted during induction, unconsciousness, and immediately prior to recovery of consciousness, for a total of 10 analysis epochs. The EEG data in each epoch were analyzed using source-localized spectral analysis, phase-lag index, and graph theoretical techniques. Posterior alpha power was significantly depressed during unconsciousness, and gradually approached baseline levels over the 3 h recovery period. Phase-lag index did not distinguish between states of consciousness or stages of recovery. Network efficiency was significantly depressed and network clustering coefficient was significantly increased during unconsciousness; these graph theoretical measures returned to baseline during the 3 h recovery period. Posterior alpha power may be a potential biomarker for normal recovery of functional brain networks after general anesthesia.

The Gliotransmitter D-Serine Promotes Synapse Maturation and Axonal Stabilization In Vivo	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						D-serine; gliotransmission; plasticity; retinotectal; visual system; Xenopus laevis	D-ASPARTATE RECEPTOR; LONG-TERM POTENTIATION; NMDA RECEPTOR; DENDRITIC ARBOR; SILENT SYNAPSES; BRANCH DYNAMICS; AMPA RECEPTORS; RACEMASE GENE; MAP FORMATION; RAT-BRAIN	The NMDAR is thought to play a key role in the refinement of connectivity in developing neural circuits. Pharmacological blockade or genetic loss-of-function manipulations that prevent NMDAR function during development result in the disorganization of topographic axonal projections. However, because NMDARs contribute to overall glutamatergic neurotransmission, such loss-of-function experiments fail to adequately distinguish between the roles played by NMDARs and neural activity in general. The gliotransmitter D-serine is a coagonist of the NMDAR that is required for NMDAR channel opening, but which cannot mediate neurotransmission on its own. Here we demonstrate that acute administration of D-serine has no immediate effect on glutamate release or AMPA-mediated neurotransmission. We show that endogenous D-serine is normally present below saturating levels in the developing visual system of the Xenopus tadpole. Using an amperometric enzymatic biosensor, we demonstrate that glutamatergic activation elevates ambient endogenous D-serine levels in the optic tectum. Chronically elevating levels of D-serine promoted synaptic maturation and resulted in the hyperstabilization of developing axon branches in the tadpole visual system. Conversely, treatment with an enzyme that degrades endogenous D-serine resulted in impaired synaptic maturation. Despite the reduction in axon arbor complexity seen in D-serine-treated animals, tectal neuron visual receptive fields were expanded, suggesting a failure to prune divergent retinal inputs. Together, these findings positively implicate NMDAR-mediated neurotransmission in developmental synapse maturation and the stabilization of axonal inputs and reveal a potential role for D-serine as an endogenous modulator of circuit refinement.

TS is highly heritable, but its underlying genetic causes are still elusive, and no genome-wide significant loci have been discovered to date. We analyzed a European ancestry sample of 2,434 TS cases and 4,093 ancestry-matched controls for rare (<1% frequency) copy-number variants (CNVs) using SNP microarray data. We observed an enrichment of global CNV burden that was prominent for large (>1 Mb), singleton events (OR = 2.28, 95% CI [1.39-3.79], p = 1.2310(-3)) and known, pathogenic CNVs (OR = 3.03 [1.85-5.07], p = 1.5 3 10(-5)). We also identified two individual, genome-wide significant loci, each conferring a substantial increase in TS risk (NRXN1 deletions, OR = 20.3, 95% CI [2.6-156.2]; CNTN6 duplications, OR = 10.1, 95% CI [2.3-45.4]). Approximately 1% of TS cases carry one of these CNVs, indicating that rare structural variation contributes significantly to the genetic architecture of TS.

The stress response factor FOXO3 is neuroprotective in models of Huntington's disease (HD), Parkinson's disease and motor-neuron diseases. Neuroprotective compounds acting in a FOXO-dependent manner could thus constitute bona fide drugs for promoting neuronal compensation. However, whether FOXO-dependent neuroprotection is a common feature of several compound families remains unknown. Using drug screening in C. elegans nematodes with neuronal expression of human exon-1 huntingtin (128Q), we found that 3 beta-Methoxy-Pregnenolone (MAP4343), 17 beta-oestradiol (17 beta E2) and 12 flavonoids including isoquercitrin promote neuronal function in 128Q nematodes. MAP4343, 17 beta E2 and isoquercitrin also promote stress resistance in mutant Htt striatal cells derived from knock-in HD mice. Interestingly, daf-16/FOXO is required for MAP4343, 17 beta E2 and isoquercitrin to sustain neuronal function in 128Q nematodes. This similarly applies to the GSK3 inhibitor lithium chloride (LiCl) and, as previously described, to resveratrol and the AMPK activator metformin. Daf-16/FOXO and the targets engaged by these compounds define a sub-network enriched for stress-response and neuronally-active pathways. Collectively, these data highlights the dependence on a daf-16/FOXO-interaction network as a common feature of several compound families for prolonging neuronal function in HD.

An imbalance between fusion and fission has been linked to major neurodegenerative diseases, including Huntington's, Alzheimer's, and Parkinson's diseases. A member of the Dynamin superfamily, dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1), a dynamin-related GTPase, is required for mitochondrial membrane fission. Self-assembly of DRP1 into oligomers in a GTP-dependent manner likely drives the division process. We show here that DRP1 self-assembles in two ways: i) in the presence of the non-hydrolysable GTP analog GMP-PNP into spiral-like structures of similar to 36 nm diameter; and ii) in the presence of GTP into rings composed of 13-18 monomers. The most abundant rings were composed of 16 monomers and had an outer and inner ring diameter of similar to 30 nm and similar to 20 nm, respectively. Three dimensional analysis was performed with rings containing 16 monomers. The single-particle cryo-electron microscopy map of the 16 monomer DRP1 rings suggests a side-by-side assembly of the monomer with the membrane in a parallel fashion. The inner ring diameter of 20 nm is insufficient to allow four membranes to exist as separate entities. Furthermore, we observed that mitochondria were tubulated upon incubation with DRP1 protein in vitro. The tubes had a diameter of similar to 30nm and were decorated with protein densities. These findings suggest DRP1 tubulates mitochondria, and that additional steps may be required for final mitochondrial fission.

Enrichment methods provide a feasible approach to comprehensive and adequately powered investigations of the brain methylome	NUCLEIC ACIDS RESEARCH			English	Article							DNA-METHYLATION; BASE-RESOLUTION; WIDE ASSOCIATION; MEMORY FORMATION; GENE-EXPRESSION; HUMAN GENOME; 5-HYDROXYMETHYLCYTOSINE; 5-METHYLCYTOSINE; GENERATION; EPIGENOME	Methylome-wide association studies are typically performed using microarray technologies that only assay a very small fraction of the CG methylome and entirely miss two forms of methylation that are common in brain and likely of particular relevance for neuroscience and psychiatric disorders. The alternative is to use whole genome bisulfite (WGB) sequencing but this approach is not yet practically feasible with sample sizes required for adequate statistical power. We argue for revisiting methylation enrichment methods that, provided optimal protocols are used, enable comprehensive, adequately powered and cost-effective genome-wide investigations of the brain methylome. To support our claim we use data showing that enrichment methods approximate the sensitivity obtained with WGB methods and with slightly better specificity. However, this performance is achieved at <5% of the reagent costs. Furthermore, because many more samples can be sequenced simultaneously, projects can be completed about 15 times faster. Currently the only viable option available for comprehensive brain methylome studies, enrichment methods may be critical for moving the field forward.

Schizophrenia smokers, compared to their counterparts with no comorbid psychiatric disorder, are largely unaware and indifferent to the long-term negative consequences of cigarette smoking. The objective of this study was to determine, for the first time, if these meta-cognitive deficits are associated with neuro-functional alterations in schizophrenia smokers. Methods: Twenty-four smokers with no psychiatric disorder and 21 smokers with schizophrenia (DSM-IV criteria) were scanned using functional magnetic resonance imaging and exposed to anti-smoking images. Granger causality analyses were used to examine the effective connectivity between brain regions found to be significantly activated. Results: Across groups, potent activations were observed in the left ventro-lateral pre-frontal cortex, the left amygdala (AMG), and the dorsomedial pre-frontal cortex (dmPFC). Using the dmPFC as a seed region, we found an abnormal negative connectivity from the dmPFC to the AMG in schizophrenia smokers during the viewing of anti-smoking stimuli. This abnormal connectivity was not present during the viewing of aversive stimuli unrelated to tobacco. Discussion: Given the well-established roles of the dmPFC in social cognition and of the AMG in emotional processing, our results suggest that the relative indifference of schizophrenia smokers regarding the negative consequences of tobacco smoking could be explained by a cognitive-affective dissonance.

Early life stress confers lifelong stress susceptibility in mice via ventral tegmental area OTX2	SCIENCE			English	Article							MAJOR DEPRESSION; ADULT-RATS; CHILDHOOD; BRAIN; ADVERSITY; RESPONSES; DOPAMINE; MIDBRAIN; TRAUMA; WOMEN	Early life stress increases risk for depression. Here we establish a "two-hit" stress model in mice wherein stress at a specific postnatal period increases susceptibility to adult social defeat stress and causes long-lasting transcriptional alterations that prime the ventral tegmental area (VTA)-a brain reward region-to be in a depression-like state. We identify a role for the developmental transcription factor orthodenticle homeobox 2 (Otx2) as an upstream mediator of these enduring effects. Transient juvenile-but not adult-knockdown of Otx2 in VTA mimics early life stress by increasing stress susceptibility, whereas its overexpression reverses the effects of early life stress. This work establishes a mechanism by which early life stress encodes lifelong susceptibility to stress via long-lasting transcriptional programming in VTA mediated by Otx2.

Whether a general principle governs these two types of pain is unknown. Here, we show that both basal mechanical and neuropathic pain are controlled by the microRNA-183 (miR-183) cluster in mice. This single cluster controls more than 80% of neuropathic pain-regulated genes and scales basal mechanical sensitivity and mechanical allodynia by regulating auxiliary voltage-gated calcium channel subunits alpha 2 delta-1 and alpha 2 delta-2. Basal sensitivity is controlled in nociceptors, and allodynia involves TrkB+ light-touch mechanoreceptors. These light-touch-sensitive neurons, which normally do not elicit pain, produce pain during neuropathy that is reversed by gabapentin. Thus, a single microRNA cluster continuously scales acute noxious mechanical sensitivity in nociceptive neurons and suppresses neuropathic pain transduction in a specific, light-touch-sensitive neuronal type recruited during mechanical allodynia.

Effects of chronic prenatal MK-801 treatment on object recognition, cognitive flexibility, and drug-induced locomotor activity in juvenile and adult rat offspring	BEHAVIOURAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						NMDA receptor antagonist; Set-shifting; Novel object preference; Drug-induced locomotor activity; Schizophrenia	MEDIAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; BEHAVIORAL FLEXIBILITY; SCHIZOPHRENIA; DISORDERS; EXPOSURE; DEFICITS; MODELS; MICE	Background: Patients with schizophrenia display impaired cognitive functioning and increased sensitivity to psychomimetic drugs. The neurodevelopmental hypothesis of schizophrenia posits that disruption of the developing brain predisposes neural networks to lasting structural and functional abnormalities resulting in the emergence of such symptoms in adulthood. Given the critical role of the glutamatergic system in early brain development, we investigated whether chronic prenatal exposure to the glutamate NMDA receptor antagonist, MK-801, induces schizophrenia-like behavioural and neurochemical changes in juvenile and adult rats. Methods: Pregnant Long Evans rats were administered saline or MK-801 (0.1 mg/kg; s.c.) at gestation day 7-19. Object recognition memory and cognitive flexibility were assessed in the male offspring using a novel object preference task and a maze-based set-shifting procedure, respectively. Locomotor-activating effects of acute amphetamine and MK-801 were also assessed. Results: Adult, but not juvenile, prenatally MK-801-treated rats failed to show novel object preference after a 90 min delay, suggesting that object recognition memory may have been impaired. In addition, the set-shifting task revealed impaired acquisition of a new rule in adult prenatally MK-801-treated rats compared to controls. This deficit appeared to be driven by regression to the previously learned behaviour. There were no significant differences in drug-induced locomotor activity in juvenile offspring or in adult offspring following acute amphetamine challenges. Unexpectedly, MK-801-induced locomotor activity in adult prenatally MK-801-treated rats was lower compared to controls. Conclusions: Glutamate transmission dysfunction during early development may modify behavioural parameters in adulthood, though these parameters do not appear to model deficits observed in schizophrenia.

Individuals with Gorlin syndrome can manifest a wide range of phenotypic abnormalities, with about 5% of family members developing medulloblastoma, usually occurring in the first 3 years of life. Gorlin syndrome is associated with germline mutations in components of the Sonic Hedgehog pathway, including Patched1 (PTCH1) and Suppressor of fused (SUFU). SUFU mutation carriers appear to have an especially high risk of early-onset medulloblastoma. Surveillance MRI in the first years of life in SUFU mutation carriers is, therefore, recommended. Given the risk of basal cell carcinomas, regular dermatologic examinations and sun protection are also recommended. Rhabdoid tumors (RT) are tumors initially defined by the descriptive "rhabdoid" term, implying a phenotypic similarity with rhabdomyoblasts at the microscopic level. RTs usually present before the age of 3 and can arise within the cranium as atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumors or extracranially, especially in the kidney, as malignant rhabdoid tumors. However, RTs of both types share germline and somatic mutations in SMARCB1 or, more rarely, SMARCA4, each of which encodes a chromatin remodeling family member. SMARCA4 mutations are particularly associated with small cell carcinoma of the ovary, hypercalcemic type (SCCOHT). The outcome following a diagnosis of any of these tumors is often poor, and the value of surveillance is unknown. International efforts to determine surveillance protocols are underway, and preliminary recommendations are made for carriers of SMARCB1 and SMARCA4 mutations. (C) 2017 AACR.

PHTS includes several disorders with shared and distinct clinical features. These are associated with elevated lifetime risk of breast, thyroid, endometrial, colorectal, and renal cancers as well as melanoma. Thyroid cancer represents the predominant cancer risk under age 20 years. DICER1 syndrome includes risk for pleuropulmonary blastoma, cystic nephroma, ovarian sex cord-stromal tumors, and multinodular goiter and thyroid carcinoma as well as brain tumors including pineoblastoma and pituitary blastoma. Individuals with HLRCC may develop multiple cutaneous and uterine leiomyomas, and they have an elevated risk of renal cell carcinoma. For each of these syndromes, a summary of the key syndromic features is provided, the underlying genetic events are discussed, and specific screening is recommended. (C) 2017 AACR.

The objective of the study is to improve the prediction of long-term functional outcome following SCI based on the acute clinical findings. A total of 76 patients with acute traumatic SCI were prospectively enrolled in a cohort study in a single Level I trauma center. Spinal Cord Independence Measure (SCIM) at 1 year after the trauma was the primary outcome. Potential predictors of functional outcome were recorded during the acute hospitalization: age, sex, level and type of injury, comorbidities, American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) Impairment Scale (AIS), ASIA Motor Score (AMS), ASIA Light Touch score (LT), ASIA Pin Prick score (PP), Injury Severity Score (ISS), traumatic brain injury, and delay from trauma to surgery. A linear regression model was created with the primary outcome modeled relative to the acute clinical findings. Only four variables were selected in the model, with performance averaging an R-square value of 0.57. In descending order, the best predictors for SCIM at 1 year were: LT, AIS grade, ISS, and AMS. One-year functional outcome (SCIM) can be estimated by a simple equation that takes into account four parameters of the initial physical examination. Estimating the patient long-term outcome early after traumatic SCI is important in order to define the management strategies that might diminish the costs and to give the patient and family a better view of the long-term expectations.

A Targeted Proteomics Analysis of Cerebrospinal Fluid after Acute Human Spinal Cord Injury	JOURNAL OF NEUROTRAUMA			English	Article						biomarkers; CSF; injury severity; proteomics; SCI	TRAUMATIC BRAIN-INJURY; COAGULATION-FACTOR-XII; ISCHEMIA-REPERFUSION INJURY; KALLIKREIN-KININ SYSTEM; CLINICAL-TRIALS; NEUROLOGICAL CLASSIFICATION; INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS; STRUCTURAL BIOMARKERS; THERAPEUTIC TARGET; CONTUSION INJURY	Efforts to validate novel therapies in acute clinical trials for spinal cord injury (SCI) are impeded by the lack of objective quantitative measures that reflect injury severity and accurately predict neurological recovery. Therefore, a strong rationale exists for establishing neurochemical biomarkers that objectively quantify injury severity and predict outcome. Here, we conducted a targeted proteomics analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples derived from 29 acute SCI patients (American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale [AIS] A, B, or C) acquired at 24, 48, and 72h post-injury. From a total of 165 proteins, we identified 27 potential biomarkers of injury severity (baseline AIS A, B, or C), with triosephosphate isomerase having the strongest relationship to AIS grade. The majority of affected proteins (24 of 27) were more abundant in samples from AIS A patients than in those from AIS C patients, suggesting that for the most part, these proteins are released into the CSF more readily with more severe trauma to the spinal cord. We then analyzed the relationship between CSF protein abundance and neurological recovery. For AIS grade improvement over 6 months, we identified 34 proteins that were associated with AIS grade conversion (p<0.05); however, these associations were not statistically significant after adjusting for multiple comparisons. For total motor score (TMS) recovery over 6 months, after adjusting for baseline neurological injury level, we identified 46 proteins with a statistically significant association with TMS recovery. Twenty-two of these proteins were among the 27 proteins that were related to baseline AIS grade, consistent with the notion that protein markers that reflect a more severe injury also appropriately predict a poorer recovery of motor function. In summary, this study provides a description of the CSF proteome changes that occur after acute human SCI, and reveals a number of protein candidates for further validation as potential biomarkers of injury severity.

In mouse models, mutations in Scrib1 cause a severe form of neural tube defects (NTDs) as a result of a defective planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling. In this study, we dissected the role of Scrib1 in the pathogenesis of NTDs in its mouse mutant Circletail (Crc), in cell lines and in a human NTD cohort. While there were no obvious defects in ABP in the Scrib1(Crc/Crc) neuroepihelial cells, we identified an abnormal localization of the apical protein Par-3 and of the PCP protein Vangl2. These results were concordant with those obtained following a partial knockdown of Scrib1 in MDCK II cells. Par-3 was able to rescue the localization defect of Vangl1 (paralog of Vangl2) caused by partial knockdown of Scrib1 suggesting that Scrib1 exerts its effect on Vangl1 localization indirectly through Par-3. This conclusion is supported by our findings of an apical enrichment of Vangl1 following a partial knockdown of Par-3. Re-sequencing analysis of SCRIB1 in 473 NTD patients led to the identification of 5 rare heterozygous missense mutations that were predicted to be pathogenic. Two of these mutations, p.Gly263Ser and p.Gln808His, and 2 mouse NTD mutations, p.Ile285Lys and p.Glu814Gly, affected Scrib1 membrane localization and its modulating role of Par-3 and Vangl1 localization. Our study demonstrates an important role of Scrib1 in the pathogenesis of NTDs through its mediating effect of Par-3 and Vangl1/2 localization and most likely independently of ABP.

The Lower Extremity Motor Coordination Test (LEMOCOT) is an outcome measure recently developed for stroke population. The aim of this study was to document: 1) intra- and interrater reliability; 2) the standard error of measurement and minimal detectable change; and 3) the construct validity of the measurements obtained with the LEMOCOT in the adult ARSACS population. Results: The LEMOCOT has shown a good intra- and interrater reliability with an intraclass correlation coefficient ranging from 0.92 to 0.97 for both dominant and non-dominant side. The construct validity (hypothesis testing) is satisfying where LEMOCOT's score negatively correlated with participants' age (r = -0.74) and the score of the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (r = -0.86) and positively correlated with the balance and mobility tests (r = 0.82 with the Berg Balance Scale, r = 0.61 with the Six-Minute Walk Test, r = 0.57 with the 10-Meter Walk Test). The LEMOCOT was also able to distinguish between patients according to disease stages. Conclusion: The LEMOCOT is a valid and reliable tool to assess lower limb coordination in the ARSACS population for whom the lack of coordination is a common symptom. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, the authors address the anatomical classification of these AVMs and propose a classification that considers factors influencing their endovascular curability. Methods: From 1995 to 2013, clinical and angiographic data of cerebral AVMs were prospectively collected. We reviewed data from patients treated for a deep-seated AVM with the goal to distinguish factors that influence the curability and the outcome of these AVMs. Results: 134 patients (mean age: 28 years) were consecutively treated by endovascular techniques. We describe an anatomical classification concerning the exact location of the nidus and distinguish 5 different sub-types (anterior, lateral, medial, posterior and midbrain). Then, we propose a grading system based on statistical analysis of our series to evaluate the curability of a deep AVM. This comprehensive score is calculated with the Spetzler-Martin grade, the location of the nidus, its type, arterial feeders and venous drainage. Conclusions: Deep-seated AVMs may be classified according to their exact location; we can distinguish 5 different sub-types (anterior, lateral, medial, posterior and midbrain). Each group presented different arterial supplies and venous drainage that influenced treatment possibilities. The comprehensive grading system that we propose in this study must be tested in another deep-seated AVMs population. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

These premotor areas are components of complex anatomical networks that include the primary motor cortex (M1) of both hemispheres. One way that PMd and PMv could play distinct roles in hand movements is by modulating the outputs of M1 differently. However, patterns of effects from PMd and PMv on the outputs ofM1have not been compared systematically. Our goals were to study how PMd within the same (i.e., ipsilateral or iPMd) and in the opposite hemisphere (i.e., contralateral or cPMd) can shape M1 outputs and then compare these effects with those induced by PMv. We used paired-pulse protocols with intracortical microstimulation techniques in sedated female cebus monkeys while recording EMG signals from intrinsic hand and forearm muscles. A conditioning stimulus was delivered in iPMd or cPMd concurrently or before a test stimulus in M1. The patterns of modulatory effects from PMd were compared with those from PMv collected in the same animals. Striking differences were revealed. Conditioning stimulation in iPMd induced more frequent and powerful inhibitory effects on M1 outputs compared with iPMv. In the opposite hemisphere, cPMd conditioning induced more frequent and powerful facilitatory effects than cPMv. These contrasting patterns of modulatory effects could allow PMd and PMv to play distinct functions for the control of hand movements and predispose them to undertake different, perhaps somewhat opposite, roles in motor recovery after brain injury.

Maternal prenatal anxiety and child COMT genotype predict working memory and symptoms of ADHD	PLOS ONE			English	Article							CATECHOL-O-METHYLTRANSFERASE; POSTNATAL DEPRESSION SCALE; CRISP EXPERIENTIAL INDEX; DIFFICULTIES QUESTIONNAIRE; VAL(158)MET GENOTYPE; EXECUTIVE FUNCTION; COMMUNITY SAMPLE; HUMAN BRAIN; STRESS; PREGNANCY	Maternal prenatal anxiety is an important risk factor for altered child neurodevelopment but there is uncertainty concerning the biological mechanisms involved and sources of individual differences in children's responses. We sought to determine the role of functional genetic variation in COMT, which encodes catechol-O-methyltransferase, in the association between maternal prenatal anxiety and child symptoms of ADHD and working memory. We used the prospectively-designed ALSPAC cohort (n = 6,969) for our primary data analyses followed by replication analyses in the PREDO cohort (n = 425). Maternal prenatal anxiety was based on self-report measures; child symptoms of ADHD were collected from 4-15 years of age; working memory was assessed from in-person testing at age 8 years; and genetic variation in COMT at rs4680 was determined in both mothers and children. The association between maternal prenatal anxiety and child attention/hyperactivity symptoms and working memory was moderated by the child's rs4680 genotype, with stronger effects obtained for the val/val (G: G) genotype relative to val/met (A:G) (all p < 0.01) and met/met (A: A) groups (all p < 0.05). Similar findings were observed in the PREDO cohort where maternal prenatal anxiety interacted with child rs4680 to predict symptoms of ADHD at 3.5 years of age. The findings, from two cohorts, show a robust gene-environment interaction, which may contribute to inter-individual differences in the effects of maternal prenatal anxiety on developmental outcomes from childhood to mid-adolescence.

The trait is thought to result from the interaction between high arousal responses to potential rewards and poor self-control. Studies have suggested that impulsivity confers vulnerability to both addiction and obesity. However, results in this area are unclear, perhaps due to the high phenotypic complexity of addictions and obesity. Focusing on impulsivity, the aim of this review is to tackle the putative overlaps between addiction and obesity in four domains: (1) personality research, (2) neurocognitive tasks, (3) brain imaging, and (4) clinical evidence. We suggest that three impulsivity-related domains are particularly relevant for our understanding of similarities between addiction and obesity: lower self-control (high Disinhibition/low Conscientiousness), reward sensitivity (high Extraversion/Positive Emotionality), and negative affect (high Neuroticism/Negative Emotionality). Neurocognitive studies have shown that obesity and addiction are both associated with increased impulsive decision-making and attention bias in response to drug or food cues, respectively. Mirroring this, obesity and different forms of addiction seem to exhibit similar alterations in functional MRI brain activity in response to reward processing and during self-control tasks. Overall, our review provides an integrative approach to understand those facets of obesity that present similarities to addictive behaviors. In addition, we suggest that therapeutic interventions targeting inhibitory control may represent a promising approach for the prevention and/or treatment of obesity.

Whether pain coping is adaptive or maladaptive depends on the type of pain (e.g., escapable or inescapable), personal factors (e.g., individual experiences with coping strategies in the past), and situational circumstances. Keeping these factors in mind, costs and benefits of different strategies have to be appraised and will guide behavioral decisions in the face of pain. In this review we present pain coping as an unconscious decision-making process during which accurately evaluated costs and benefits lead to adaptive pain coping behavior. We emphasize the importance of passive coping as an adaptive strategy when dealing with ongoing pain and thus go beyond the common view of passivity as a default state of helplessness. In combination with passive pain coping, we highlight the role of the reward system in reestablishing affective homeostasis and discuss existing evidence on a behavioral and neural level. We further present neural circuits involved in the decision-making process of pain coping when circumstances are ambiguous and, therefore, costs and benefits are difficult to anticipate. Finally, we address the wider implications of this topic by discussing its relevance for chronic pain patients.

The priming of priming: Evidence that the N400 reflects context-dependent post-retrieval word integration in working memory	NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS			English	Article						N400; Semantic priming; Context effects; List effects; Relational priming; Analogical reasoning	SEMANTIC CONTEXT; PREDICTION; COMPREHENSION; ASSOCIATION; NETWORK; ERP	Which cognitive processes are reflected by the N400 in ERPs is still controversial. Various recent articles (Lau et al., 2008; Brouwer et al., 2012) have revived the idea that only lexical pre-activation processes (such as automatic spreading activation, ASA) are strongly supported, while post-lexical integrative processes are not. Challenging this view, the present ERP study replicates a behavioral study by McKoon and Ratcliff (1995) who demonstrated that a prime-target pair such as finger hand shows stronger priming when a majority of other pairs in the list share the analogous semantic relationship (here: part-whole), even at short stimulus onset asynchronies (250 ms). We created lists with four different types of semantic relationship (synonyms, part-whole, category-member, and opposites) and compared priming for pairs in a consistent list with those in an inconsistent list as well as unrelated items. Highly significant N400 reductions were found for both relatedness priming (unrelated vs. inconsistent) and relational priming (inconsistent vs. consistent). These data are taken as strong evidence that N400 priming effects are not exclusively carried by ASA-like mechanisms during lexical retrieval but also include post-lexical integration in working memory. We link the present findings to a neurocomputational model for relational reasoning (Knowlton et al., 2012) and to recent discussions of context-dependent conceptual activations (Yee and Thompson-Schill, 2016).

Application to the Ankle Joint	FRONTIERS IN COMPUTATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						biological system modeling; nonlinear system identification; time-varying systems; dynamic joint stiffness; joint neuromechanics	HUMAN ELBOW JOINT; IDENTIFICATION ALGORITHM; SYSTEM-IDENTIFICATION; HAMMERSTEIN SYSTEMS; MUSCLE-STIFFNESS; HUMAN LOCOMOTION; STRETCH; MODULATION; IMPEDANCE; RESPONSES	Dynamic joint stiffness determines the relation between joint position and torque, and plays a vital role in the control of posture and movement. Dynamic joint stiffness can be quantified during quasi-stationary conditions using disturbance experiments, where small position perturbations are applied to the joint and the torque response is recorded. Dynamic joint stiffness is composed of intrinsic and reflex mechanisms that act and change together, so that nonlinear, mathematical models and specialized system identification techniques are necessary to estimate their relative contributions to overall joint stiffness. Quasi-stationary experiments have demonstrated that dynamic joint stiffness is heavily modulated by joint position and voluntary torque. Consequently, during movement, when joint position and torque change rapidly, dynamic joint stiffness will be Time-Varying (TV). This paper introduces a new method to quantify the TV intrinsic and reflex components of dynamic joint stiffness during movement. The algorithm combines ensemble and deterministic approaches for estimation of TV systems; and uses a TV, parallel-cascade, nonlinear system identification technique to separate overall dynamic joint stiffness into intrinsic and reflex components from position and torque records. Simulation studies of a stiffness model, whose parameters varied with time as is expected during walking, demonstrated that the new algorithm accurately tracked the changes in dynamic joint stiffness using as little as 40 gait cycles. The method was also used to estimate the intrinsic and reflex dynamic ankle stiffness from an experiment with a healthy subject during which ankle movements were imposed while the subject maintained a constant muscle contraction. The method identified TV stiffness model parameters that predicted the measured torque very well, accounting for more than 95% of its variance. Moreover, both intrinsic and reflex dynamic stiffness were heavily modulated through the movement in a manner that could not be predicted from quasi-stationary experiments. The new method provides the tool needed to explore the role of dynamic stiffness in the control of movement.

The neural mechanisms by which FAA is regulated are not yet fully understood. Although a number of brain regions appear to be involved in regulating the development and expression of FAA, there is little evidence to date concerning the role of the anterior agranular insular cortex (AICa). The AICa plays a critical role in integrating the perception of visceral states with motivational behaviour such as feeding. We assessed the effect of bilateral electrolytic or ibotenic acid lesions of the AICa on FAA in male Wistar rats receiving food for varying lengths of time (2 h, 3 h, or 5 h) during the middle of the light phase (starting at either ZT4 or ZT6). Contrary to our initial expectations, we found that both electrolytic and ibotenic acid lesions significantly increased, rather than decreased, the amount of FAA expressed in lesioned rats. Despite increased FAA, lesioned rats did not eat significantly more during restricted feeding (RF) periods than control rats. Similar to controls, AlCa-lesioned rats showed negligible anticipatory activity to a restricted treat suggesting that the increased anticipatory activity in lesioned rats is associated with food restriction, rather than the appetitive value of the meal. Monitoring behaviour in an open field indicated that increased FAA in AlCa-lesioned rats was not explained by a general increase in locomotor activity. Together, these findings suggest that the AICa contributes to the network of brain regions involved in FAA.

Protocol for the Reconstructing Consciousness and Cognition (ReCCognition) Study	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						emergence; consciousness; cognition; neurobehavioral; sleep; isoflurane anesthesia	VIGILANCE TEST PVT; PSYCHOMOTOR VIGILANCE; SLEEP-DEPRIVATION; INDUCED UNCONSCIOUSNESS; KINETIC CHARACTERISTICS; GENERAL-ANESTHESIA; WORKING-MEMORY; SEVOFLURANE; DESFLURANE; RECOVERY	Important scientific and clinical questions persist about general anesthesia despite the ubiquitous clinical use of anesthetic drugs in humans since their discovery. For example, it is not known how the brain reconstitutes consciousness and cognition after the profound functional perturbation of the anesthetized state, nor has a specific pattern of functional recovery been characterized. To date, there has been a lack of detailed investigation into rates of recovery and the potential orderly return of attention, sensorimotor function, memory, reasoning and logic, abstract thinking, and processing speed. Moreover, whether such neurobehavioral functions display an invariant sequence of return across individuals is similarly unknown. To address these questions, we designed a study of healthy volunteers undergoing general anesthesia with electroencephalography and serial testing of cognitive functions (NCT01911195). The aims of this study are to characterize the temporal patterns of neurobehavioral recovery over the first several hours following termination of a deep inhaled isoflurane general anesthetic and to identify common patterns of cognitive function recovery. Additionally, we will conduct spectral analysis and reconstruct functional networks from electroencephalographic data to identify any neural correlates (e.g., connectivity patterns, graph-theoretical variables) of cognitive recovery after the perturbation of general anesthesia. To accomplish these objectives, we will enroll a total of 60 consenting adults aged 20-40 across the three participating sites. Half of the study subjects will receive general anesthesia slowly titrated to loss of consciousness (LOC) with an intravenous infusion of propofol and thereafter be maintained for 3 h with 1.3 age adjusted minimum alveolar concentration of isoflurane, while the other half of subjects serves as awake controls to gauge effects of repeated neurobehavioral testing, spontaneous fatigue and endogenous rest-activity patterns.

To develop effective early interventions that can potentially ameliorate the defining deficits of ASD and improve long-term outcomes, early detection is essential. Using prospective neuroimaging of 59 6-month-old infants with a high familial risk for ASD, we show that functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging correctly identified which individual children would receive a research clinical best-estimate diagnosis of ASD at 24months of age. Functional brain connections were defined in 6-month-old infants that correlated with 24-month scores on measures of social behavior, language, motor development, and repetitive behavior, which are all features common to the diagnosis of ASD. A fully cross-validated machine learning algorithm applied at age 6 months had a positive predictive value of 100% [95% confidence interval (CI), 62.9 to 100], correctly predicting 9 of 11 infants who received a diagnosis of ASD at 24 months (sensitivity, 81.8%; 95% CI, 47.8 to 96.8). All 48 6-month-old infants who were not diagnosed with ASD were correctly classified [specificity, 100% (95% CI, 90.8 to 100); negative predictive value, 96.0% (95% CI, 85.1 to 99.3)]. These findings have clinical implications for early risk assessment and the feasibility of developing early preventative interventions for ASD.

A Highly Efficient Human Pluripotent Stem Cell Microglia Model Displays a Neuronal-Co-culture-Specific Expression Profile and Inflammatory Response	STEM CELL REPORTS			English	Article							TISSUE-RESIDENT MACROPHAGES; IN-VITRO; YOLK-SAC; MYELOID PROGENITORS; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; DENDRITIC CELLS; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; MONOCYTES; MOUSE; DIFFERENTIATION	Microglia are increasingly implicated in brain pathology, particularly neurodegenerative disease, with many genes implicated in Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and motor neuron disease expressed in microglia. There is, therefore, a need for authentic, efficient in vitro models to study human microglial pathological mechanisms. Microglia originate from the yolk sac as MYB-independent macrophages, migrating into the developing brain to complete differentiation. Here, we recapitulate microglial ontogeny by highly efficient differentiation of embryonic MYB-independent iPSC-derived macrophages then co-culture them with iPSC-derived cortical neurons. Co-cultures retain neuronal maturity and functionality for many weeks. Co-culture microglia express key microglia-specific markers and neurodegenerative disease-relevant genes, develop highly dynamic ramifications, and are phagocytic. Upon activation they become more ameboid, releasing multiple microglia-relevant cytokines. Importantly, co-culture microglia downregulate pathogen-response pathways, upregulate homeostatic function pathways, and promote a more anti-inflammatory and pro-remodeling cytokine response than corresponding monocultures, demonstrating that co-cultures are preferable for modeling authentic microglial physiology.

This suggests that the central nervous system can extract information about body motion and external forces acting on the body from cutaneous sensory signals. We have recently shown that the central nervous system determines the direction of an unpredictable force applied to the hand so rapidly that it is able to activate ankle muscles in advance of the perturbing effect that this force has at the ankles. In this study we investigate whether this rapid change in activation of lower limb muscles is an invariant response determined by the pattern of somatosensory information arising from sensory receptors in the hand or whether it adapts to changes in postural stability. We manipulated lateral stability of upright stance by changing stance width which had no effect on the activation of upper limb muscles or hand kinematics, but produced profound changes in the activation patterns of lower limb muscles when perturbations were in the medial/lateral direction with-out affecting the activation patterns of muscles when perturbations were in the anterior/posterior direction.

J	Lalanne, L; Lutz, PE; Paille, F				Lalanne, Laurence; Lutz, Pierre-Eric; Paille, Francois			Acute impact of caffeinated alcoholic beverages on cognition: A systematic review	PROGRESS IN NEURO-PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY & BIOLOGICAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Review						Caffeine; Alcohol; Energy drink; Cognition; Cognitive impairments; Alcohol use disorder	ENERGY DRINK CONSUMPTION; COLLEGE-STUDENTS; BEHAVIORAL-CONTROL; RISK-TAKING; RESPONSE-INHIBITION; ETHANOL DRINKING; PERFORMANCE; GLUCOSE; MEMORY; IMPAIRMENT	Introduction: Energy drinks are popular beverages that are supposed to counteract sleepiness, increase energy, maintain alertness and reduce symptoms of hangover. Cognitive enhancing seems to be related to many compounds such as caffeine, taurine and vitamins. Currently, users mostly combine psychostimulant effects of energy drinks to counteract sedative effects of alcohol. However, recent literature suggests that this combination conducts to feel less intoxicated but still impaired. The goal of the present article is to review cognitive impact and subjective awareness in case of caffeinated alcoholic beverage (CAB) intoxication. Method: PubMed (January 1960 to March 2016) database was searched using the following terms: cognitive impairments, alcohol, energy drinks; cognition, alcohol, caffeine. Results: 99 papers were found but only 12 randomized controlled studies which explored cognitive disorders and subjective awareness associated with acute CAB or AED (alcohol associated with energy drinks) intoxication were included. Discussion: The present literature review confirmed that energy drinks might counteract some cognitive deficits and adverse effects of alcohol i.e. dry mouth, fatigue, headache, weakness, and perception of intoxication due to alcohol alone. This effect depends on alcohol limb but disappears when the complexity of the task increases, when driving for example. Moreover, studies clearly showed that CAB/AEDs increase impulsivity which conducts to an overconsumption of alcohol and enhanced motivation to drink compared to alcohol alone, potentiating the risk of developing addictive behaviors. This is a huge problem in adolescents with high impulsivity and immature decision making processes. Conclusion: Although energy drinks counteract some cognitive deficits due to alcohol alone, their association promotes the risk of developing alcohol addiction. As a consequence, it is necessary to better understand the neurobiological mechanisms underlying these interactions in order to better prevent the development of alcohol dependence.

Envelope statistics of self-motion signals experienced by human subjects during everyday activities: Implications for vestibular processing	PLOS ONE			English	Article							PERIPHERAL INNERVATION PATTERNS; 2ND-ORDER STIMULUS FEATURES; SLOW ROTATION ROOM; SINGLE NEURONS; NATURAL SOUNDS; VISUAL-CORTEX; INFORMATION-TRANSMISSION; ELECTROSENSORY NEURONS; TEMPORAL DECORRELATION; DETECTION THRESHOLDS	There is accumulating evidence that the brain's neural coding strategies are constrained by natural stimulus statistics. Here we investigated the statistics of the time varying envelope (i.e. a second-order stimulus attribute that is related to variance) of rotational and translational self-motion signals experienced by human subjects during everyday activities. We found that envelopes can reach large values across all six motion dimensions (similar to 450 deg/s for rotations and similar to 4 G for translations). Unlike results obtained in other sensory modalities, the spectral power of envelope signals decreased slowly for low (< 2 Hz) and more sharply for high (>2 Hz) temporal frequencies and thus was not well-fit by a power law. We next compared the spectral properties of envelope signals resulting from active and passive self-motion, as well as those resulting from signals obtained when the subject is absent (i.e. external stimuli). Our data suggest that different mechanisms underlie deviation from scale invariance in rotational and translational self-motion envelopes. Specifically, active selfmotion and filtering by the human body cause deviation from scale invariance primarily for translational and rotational envelope signals, respectively. Finally, we used well-established models in order to predict the responses of peripheral vestibular afferents to natural envelope stimuli. We found that irregular afferents responded more strongly to envelopes than their regular counterparts. Our findings have important consequences for understanding the coding strategies used by the vestibular system to process natural second-order self-motion signals.

The majority of methods have applied TFCE to voxelwise data. The need to understand the relationship among multiple variables and imaging modalities has become critical. We propose a new method of applying TFCE to vertexwise statistical images as well as cortexwise (either voxel-or vertexwise) mediation analysis. Here we present TFCE_mediation, a toolbox that can be used for cortexwise multiple regression analysis with TFCE, and additionally cortexwise mediation using TFCE. The toolbox is open source and publicly available (https://github.com/trislett/TFCE_mediation). We validated TFCE_mediation in healthy controls from two independent multimodal neuroimaging samples (N5199 and N5183). We found a consistent structure-function relationship between surface area and the first independent component (IC1) of the N-back task, that white matter fractional anisotropy is strongly associated with IC1 N-back, and that our voxel-based results are essentially identical to FSL randomise using TFCE (all P-FWE<0.05). Using cortexwise mediation, we showed that the relationship between white matter FA and IC1 N-back is mediated by surface area in the right superior frontal cortex (P-FWE < 0.05). We also demonstrated that the same mediation model is present using vertexwise mediation (P-FWE < 0.05). In conclusion, cortexwise analysis with TFCE provides an effective analysis of multimodal neuroimaging data. Furthermore, cortexwise mediation analysis may identify or explain a mechanism that underlies an observed relationship among a predictor, intermediary, and dependent variables in which one of these variables is assessed at a whole-brain scale.

Using publicly accessible data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), we examined 1-year hippocampal atrophy rates generated by each of five automated or semiautomated hippocampal segmentation algorithms in patients with Alzheimer's disease, subjects with mild cognitive impairment, or elderly controls. We analyzed MRI data from 398 and 62 subjects available at baseline and at 1 year at MRI field strengths of 1.5 T and 3 T, respectively. We observed a high rate of hippocampal segmentation failures across all algorithms and diagnostic categories, with only 50.8% of subjects at 1.5 T and 58.1% of subjects at 3 T passing stringent segmentation quality control. We also found that all algorithms identified several subjects (between 2.94% and 48.68%) across all diagnostic categories showing increases in hippocampal volume over 1 year. For any given algorithm, hippocampal "growth" could not entirely be explained by excluding patients with flawed hippocampal segmentations, scan-rescan variability, or MRI field strength. Furthermore, different algorithms did not uniformly identify the same subjects as hippocampal "growers," and showed very poor concordance in estimates of magnitude of hippocampal volume change over time (intraclass correlation coefficient 0.319 at 1.5 T and 0.149 at 3 T). This precluded a meaningful analysis of whether hippocampal "growth" represents a true biological phenomenon. Taken together, our findings suggest that longitudinal hippocampal volume change should be interpreted with considerable caution as a biomarker. (C) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Gene Networks Show Associations with Seed Region Connectivity	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING			English	Article						network-based clustering; structural connectivity; DW-MRI; gene-set enrichment analysis; neuronal plasticity	HUMAN BRAIN TRANSCRIPTOME; DIFFUSION-WEIGHTED MRI; ADULT HUMAN BRAIN; MOUSE-BRAIN; FUNCTIONAL-ORGANIZATION; CAENORHABDITIS-ELEGANS; SYNAPTIC CONNECTIVITY; COEXPRESSION NETWORK; NEURONAL PLASTICITY; SYSTEMS BIOLOGY	Primary patterns in adult brain connectivity are established during development by coordinated networks of transiently expressed genes; however, neural networks remain malleable throughout life. The present study hypothesizes that structural connectivity from key seed regions may induce effects on their connected targets, which are reflected in gene expression at those targeted regions. To test this hypothesis, analyses were performed on data from two brains from the Allen Human Brain Atlas, for which both gene expression and DW-MRI were available. Structural connectivity was estimated from the DW-MRI data and an approach motivated by network topology, that is, weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA), was used to cluster genes with similar patterns of expression across the brain. Group exponential lasso models were then used to predict gene cluster expression summaries as a function of seed region structural connectivity patterns. In several gene clusters, brain regions located in the brain stem, diencephalon, and hippocampal formation were identified that have significant predictive power for these expression summaries. These connectivity-associated clusters are enriched in genes associated with synaptic signaling and brain plasticity. Furthermore, using seed region based connectivity provides a novel perspective in understanding relationships between gene expression and connectivity. (C) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The p75(NTR) is a novel therapeutic target validated in a streptozotocin mouse model of diabetic retinopathy. Intravitreal (IVT) injection of small molecule p75(NTR) antagonist THX-B was therapeutic and resolved the inflammatory, vascular, and neurodegenerative phases of the retinal pathology. To simplify clinical translation, we sought a superior drug delivery method that circumvents risks associated with IVT injections. METHODS. We compared the pharmacokinetics of a single 40 mu g subconjunctival (SCJ) depot to the reported effective 5 mu g IVT injections of THX-B. We quantified therapeutic efficacy, with endpoints of inflammation, edema, and neuronal death. RESULTS. The subconjunctival depot affords retinal exposure equal to IVT injection, without resulting in detectable drug in circulation. At week 2 of diabetic retinopathy, the SCJ depot provided therapeutic efficacy similar to IVT injections, with reduced inflammation, reduced edema, reduced neuronal death, and a long-lasting protection of the retinal structure. CONCLUSIONS. Subconjunctival injections are a safe and effective route for retinal delivery of p75(NTR) antagonists. The subconjunctival route offers an advantageous, less-invasive, more compliant, and nonsystemic method to deliver p75(NTR) antagonists for the treatment of retinal diseases.

Safety and effectiveness of neuraminidase inhibitors in situations of pandemic and/or novel/variant influenza: a systematic review of the literature, 2009-15	JOURNAL OF ANTIMICROBIAL CHEMOTHERAPY			English	Review							H1N1 VIRUS-INFECTION; CRITICALLY-ILL PATIENTS; ORGAN TRANSPLANT RECIPIENTS; HEALTH-CARE PERSONNEL; NEW-YORK-CITY; HOSPITALIZED-PATIENTS; RISK-FACTORS; CLINICAL-FEATURES; HOUSEHOLD TRANSMISSION; OSELTAMIVIR TREATMENT	Objectives: To review systematically the published literature evaluating neuraminidase inhibitor (NI) safety and effectiveness in situations of pandemic and novel/variant influenza. Methods: We searched six online databases using comprehensive search criteria for observational studies and randomized controlled trials investigating the effects of NI treatment, prophylaxis or outbreak control in patients of all ages. Results: Overall, 165 studies were included (95% observational), which were generally of low methodological quality due to lack of adjustment for confounding variables. In studies reporting adjusted estimates in general populations, NI treatment appeared likely to be effective against mortality (primarily if administered within 48 h of symptom onset) and potentially effective in reducing pneumonia. NIs appeared effective in reducing secondary transmission when indicated for prophylaxis. Limited, low-quality data suggest NIs are likely safe in general populations and may be safe in pregnant women and children. Data are scarce regarding safety of NIs in adults and high-risk individuals. Conclusions: Most included studies were observational, statistically underpowered and at high risk of reporting biased and/or confounded effect estimates. NI treatment appeared likely effective in reducing mortality (cause unspecified) and pneumonia in general populations, with increasing benefit when administered with 48 h of symptom onset. NI pre- or post-exposure prophylaxis is likely effective in reducing secondary transmission of influenza in a general population. Our evidence suggests NIs are likely safe to use in the general population; however, data for children and pregnant women are limited. Knowledge gaps persist in specific populations such as Aboriginals, high-risk individuals and the elderly.	[Boikos, C.; Caya, C.; Doll, M.

Aberrant activation of NF-kappa B is a frequent event in numerous cancers, including glioblastoma, the most common and lethal form of brain tumours of glial cell origin (collectively termed gliomas). Glioblastoma is characterized by high cellular heterogeneity, resistance to therapy and almost inevitable recurrence after surgery and treatment. NF-kappa B is aberrantly activated in response to a variety of stimuli in glioblastoma, where its activity has been implicated in processes ranging from maintenance of cancer stem-like cells, stimulation of cancer cell invasion, promotion of mesenchymal identity, and resistance to radiotherapy. This review examines the mechanisms of NF-kappa B activation in glioblastoma, the involvement of NF-kappa B in several mechanisms underlying glioblastoma propagation, and discusses some of the important questions of future research into the roles of NF-kappa B in glioblastoma.

We sought to determine whether B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and N-terminal prohormone B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) could enhance risk prediction of a broad range of cardiovascular outcomes in patients with acute coronary syndrome and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Methods and Results--Patients with a recent acute coronary syndrome and type 2 diabetes mellitus were prospectively enrolled in the ELIXA trial (n= 5525, follow-up time 26 months). Best risk models were constructed from relevant baseline variables with and without BNP/NT- proBNP. C statistics, Net Reclassification Index, and Integrated Discrimination Index were analyzed to estimate the value of adding BNP or NT-proBNP to best risk models. Overall, BNP and NT-proBNP were the most important predictors of all outcomes examined, irrespective of history of heart failure or any prior cardiovascular disease. BNP significantly improved C statistics when added to risk models for each outcome examined, the strongest increments being in death (0.77-0.82, P< 0.001), cardiovascular death (0.77-0.83, P< 0.001), and heart failure (0.84-0.87, P< 0.001). BNP or NT-proBNP alone predicted death as well as all other variables combined (0.77 versus 0.77). Conclusions--In patients with a recent acute coronary syndrome and type 2 diabetes mellitus, BNP and NT-proBNP were powerful predictors of cardiovascular outcomes beyond heart failure and death, ie, were also predictive of MI and stroke. Natriuretic peptides added as much predictive information about death as all other conventional variables combined.

In FPCA, low-dimensional components are extracted from a single functional dataset such that they explain the most variance of the dataset, whereas in FMCCA, low-dimensional components are obtained from each of multiple functional datasets in such a way that the associations among the components are maximized across the different sets. In this paper, we propose a unified approach to FPCA and FMCCA. The proposed approach subsumes both techniques as special cases. Furthermore, it permits a compromise between the techniques, such that components are obtained from each set of functional data to maximize their associations across different datasets, while accounting for the variance of the data well. We propose a single optimization criterion for the proposed approach, and develop an alternating regularized least squares algorithm to minimize the criterion in combination with basis function approximations to functions. We conduct a simulation study to investigate the performance of the proposed approach based on synthetic data. We also apply the approach for the analysis of multiple-subject functional magnetic resonance imaging data to obtain low-dimensional components of blood-oxygen level-dependent signal changes of the brain over time, which are highly correlated across the subjects as well as representative of the data. The extracted components are used to identify networks of neural activity that are commonly activated across the subjects while carrying out a working memory task.

In this context, the current special edition aims to elaborate three important dimensions in Tourette Disorder. Firstly, the effective characterization and etiological basis of the disorder are reviewed, since such characterization impacts accurate assessment. Secondly, subsequent articles cover the comprehensive evaluation and assessment of tic disorders, essential for treatment planning. Thirdly, the final group of articles propose novel and innovative treatment strategies for pharmacologically and behaviorally reducing tic frequency. In the current editorial address, two main issues seem crucial to the development of interventions for Tourette disorder. Primarily, integrating new technology in treatments, while supporting cognitive and behavioral recovery through learning self-controlled strategies. Additionally, the dissemination of study results to frontline resources, needs streamlining and empirically validated treatments for tic disorders should be the subject of knowledge translation to community organizations and be more widely available to the public.

Social media in epilepsy: A quantitative and qualitative analysis	EPILEPSY & BEHAVIOR			English	Article						Epilepsy; Seizure; Facebook; Twitter; Social media	MANAGEMENT; DISORDER; SURGERY; METRICS	Background: While the social burden of epilepsy has been extensively studied, an evaluation of social media related to epilepsy may provide novel insight into disease perception, patient needs and access to treatments. The objective of this study is to assess patterns in social media and online communication usage related to epilepsy and its associated topics. Methods: We searched two major social media platforms (Facebook and Twitter) for public accounts dedicated to epilepsy. Results were analyzed using qualitative and quantitative methodologies. The former involved thematic and word count analysis for online posts and tweets on these platforms, while the latter employed descriptive statistics and non-parametric tests. Results: Facebook had a higher number of pages (840 accounts) and users (3 million) compared to Twitter (137 accounts and 274,663 users). Foundation and support groups comprised most of the accounts and users on both Facebook and Twitter. The number of accounts increased by 100% from 2012 to 2016. Among the 403 posts and tweets analyzed, "providing information" on medications or correcting common misconceptions in epilepsy was the most common theme (48%). Surgical interventions for epilepsy were only mentioned in 1% of all posts and tweets. Conclusions: The current study provides a comprehensive reference on the usage of social media in epilepsy. The number of online users interested in epilepsy is likely the highest among all neurological conditions. Surgery, as a method of treating refractory epilepsy, however, could be underrepresented on social media. (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Identifying a common signaling cascade to target all cancers has been a major obstacle in medicine. A quantum dynamic framework has been established to explain mutation theory, biological energy landscapes, cell communication patterns and the cancer interactome under the influence of quantum chaos. Quantum tunneling in mutagenesis, vacuum energy field dynamics, and cytoskeletal networks in tumor morphogenesis have revealed the applicability for description of cancer dynamics, which is discussed with a brief account of endogenous hallucinogens, bioelectromagnetism and water fluctuations. A holistic model of mathematical oncology has been provided to identify key signaling pathways required for the phenotypic reprogramming of cancer through an epigenetic landscape. The paper will also serve as a mathematical guide to understand the cancer interactome by interlinking theoretical and experimental oncology. A multi-dimensional model of quantum evolution by adaptive selection has been established for cancer biology. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Historically, neuroethics has provided an opportunity to synergize different disciplines, notably proposing a two- way dialogue between an 'ethics of neuroscience' and a 'neuroscience of ethics'. However, questions surface as to whether a 'neuroscience of ethics' is a useful and unified branch of research and whether it can actually inform or lead to theoretical insights and transferable practical knowledge to help resolve ethical questions. In this article, we examine why the neuroscience of ethics is a promising area of research and summarize what we have learned so far regarding its most promising goals and contributions. We then review some of the keymethodological challenges whichmay have hindered the use of results generated thus far by the neuroscience of ethics. Strategies are suggested to address these challenges and improve the quality of research and increase neuroscience's usefulness for applied ethics and society at large. Finally, we reflect on potential outcomes of a neuroscience of ethics and discuss the different strategies that could be used to support knowledge transfer to help different stakeholders integrate knowledge from the neuroscience of ethics.

A fierce debate has emerged about the ethical aspects of moral enhancement, notably because steering moral enhancement in a particular direction involves choosing amongst a wide array of competing options, and these options entail deciding which moral theory or attributes of the moral agent would benefit from enhancement. Furthermore, the ability and effectiveness of different neurotechnologies to enhance morality have not been carefully examined. In this paper, we assess the practical feasibility of moral enhancement neurotechnologies. We reviewed the literature on neuroscience and cognitive science models of moral judgment and analyzed their implications for the specific target of intervention (cognition, volition or affect) in moral enhancement. We also reviewed and compared evidence on available neurotechnologies that could serve as tools of moral enhancement. We conclude that the predictions of rationalist, emotivist, and dual process models are at odds with evidence, while different intuitionist models of moral judgment are more likely to be aligned with it. Furthermore, the project of moral enhancement is not feasible in the near future as it rests on the use of neurointerventions, which have no moral enhancement effects or, worse, negative effects.

J	Racine, E; Rousseau-Lesage, S				Racine, Eric; Rousseau-Lesage, Simon			THE VOLUNTARY NATURE OF DECISION-MAKING IN ADDICTION: STATIC METAPHYSICAL VIEWS VERSUS EPISTEMOLOGICALLY DYNAMIC VIEWS	BIOETHICS			English	Article						free will; voluntary action; autonomy; addiction; consent	FREE-WILL; INFORMED-CONSENT; EGO-DEPLETION; CONSCIOUS INTENTION; BRAIN; AUTONOMY; SELF; RESPONSIBILITY; NEUROBIOLOGY; PSYCHOLOGY	The degree of autonomy present in the choices made by individuals with an addiction, notably in the context of research, is unclear and debated. Some have argued that addiction, as it is commonly understood, prevents people from having sufficient decision-making capacity or self-control to engage in choices involving substances to which they have an addiction. Others have criticized this position for being too radical and have counter-argued in favour of the full autonomy of people with an addiction. Aligning ourselves with middle-ground positions between these two extremes, we flesh out an account of voluntary action that makes room for finer-grained analyses than the proposed all-or-nothing stances, which rely on a rather static metaphysical understanding of the nature of the voluntariness of action. In contrast, a dynamic concept of voluntary action better accounts for varying levels of voluntariness of the person with an addiction which takes into consideration internal (e. g. cravings) and external (e. g. perceptions of degrees of freedom related to different options) determinants of choice. Accordingly, like other components of autonomous choices such as level of information, voluntariness can fluctuate. Therefore, there are important implications for research and clinical ethics in matters of consent, recruitment, and therapeutic approaches. Overall, our proposal is inspired by a pragmatist understanding of voluntary action, notably with respect to how voluntariness is both informed by actions and experiences that shape one's view of the world.

This study aimed to (1) investigate whether a machine learning-based technique could accurately classify MS participants into groups defined by upper extremity function (i.e. motor function preserved (MP) vs. motor function impaired (MI)) based on their regional grey matter measures (GMM, cortical thickness and deep grey matter volume) and inter-regional functional connection (FC), (2) investigate which features (GMM, FC, or GMM + FC) could classify groups more accurately, and (3) identify the multivariate patterns of GMM and FCs that are most discriminative between MP and MI participants, and between each of these groups and the healthy controls (HCs). With 26 MP, 25 MI, and 21 HCs (age and sex matched) underwent T1-weighted and resting-state functional MRI at 3 T, we applied support vector machine (SVM) based classification to learn discriminant functions indicating regions in which GMM or between which FCs were most discriminative between groups. This study demonstrates that there exist structural and FC patterns sufficient for correct classification of upper limb motor ability of people with MS. The classifier with GMM + FC features yielded the highest accuracy of 85.61 % (p < 0.001) to distinguish between the MS groups using leave-one-out cross-validation. It suggests that a machine-learning approach combining structural and functional features is useful for identifying the specific neural substrates that are necessary and sufficient to preserve motor function among people with MS.

Clozapine, the most effective antipsychotic drug, alters electroencephalographic activity and carries a significant risk of causing seizures. Unfortunately, this risk limits the drug's potential use in treating pharmacoresistant psychosis in patients with epilepsy. We present a unique case in which we used clozapine successfully as a last resort treatment for chronic interictal psychosis in a 43-year-old woman with severe pharmacoresistant epilepsy and recurrent status epilepticus. Her psychotic symptoms improved markedly without an increase in the frequency of seizures despite gradual titration of the clozapine dose up to 300 mg daily. Her response demonstrates that, properly monitored, clozapine can be an effective treatment for psychosis even in patients with daily seizures.

Sleep Disturbances in the Prodromal Stage of Parkinson Disease	CURRENT TREATMENT OPTIONS IN NEUROLOGY			English	Review						Parkinson's disease; Sleep disturbances; Prodromal stage; REM sleep behavior disorder; Insomnia; Obstructive sleep apnea; Excessive daytime somnolence	EYE-MOVEMENT SLEEP; EXCESSIVE DAYTIME SLEEPINESS; NIGROSTRIATAL DOPAMINERGIC DEGENERATION; BEHAVIOR DISORDER RBD; COERULEUS/SUBCOERULEUS COMPLEX; NONMOTOR SYMPTOMS; RISK-FACTORS; NEURONS; COHORT; APNEA	Decades of research on neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease (PD) have shifted our focus from clinical symptomatic stages to one step earlier, the prodromal stage. There is convincing evidence showing that sleep disorders such as excessive daytime somnolence, insomnia, obstructive sleep apnea, and particularly REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) are potential prodromal features starting years and decades before conversion to PD. This review aims to provide an overview on various sleep disorders as prodromal features of PD. We start with a discussion of how neuroanatomy of sleep might link to PD pathology. Afterwards, specific sleep disorders that are either known or suspected to be a prodromal symptom for PD, namely insomnia, sleep apnea, somnolence, and RBD, are discussed. Disturbances in serotonergic, cholinergic, dopaminergic, and glutamatergic neurotransmitter systems have made sleep disorders potential candidates for prodromal PD. Nevertheless, the strength of such linkage varies considerably for different entities. While RBD is by far the strongest prodromal manifestation for PD with a high likelihood of phenoconversion and there is reasonable evidence that somnolence can predict PD, data on the prodromal role of sleep apnea and insomnia is limited. Treatment options are available for symptomatic relief of prodromal sleep disorders; however, there is a dearth of knowledge on neuroprotective agents to be used on people with prodromal sleep disorders to either prevent or postpone conversion to PD.

J	Nielsen, T				Nielsen, Tore			When Was Your Earliest Dream? Association of Very Early Dream Recall With Frequent Current Nightmares Supports a Stress-Acceleration Explanation of Nightmares	DREAMING			English	Article						nightmares; infantile amnesia; stress-acceleration hypothesis; early childhood adversity	NEUROCOGNITIVE MODEL; CHILDHOOD MEMORIES; INTERNET RESEARCH; TYPICAL DREAMS; BAD DREAMS; REM-SLEEP; HYPOTHESIS; SUFFERERS; DISTRESS; DISORDER	The stress-acceleration hypothesis of nightmares (Nielsen, 2017) stipulates that individuals with frequent nightmares have better access to memories-including dreams-originating in the infantile amnesia period than do individuals without nightmares. This was tested on an available sample of 17,014 participants who estimated their current nightmare frequency and dated their earliest remembered dreams. One-way analyses of variance with 10 levels of Dream-Age (1-10 years) as independent variable and log nightmare recall as the dependent measure were computed for all early dreams combined and, separately, for those who remembered only positive or negative early dreams. An earliest dream from the infantile amnesia period was recalled by 4.63% of participants. A main effect for Dream-Age (p < .0000001) confirmed that these participants had more current nightmares. The effect was also seen for both emotionally positive and negative early dreams, suggesting a general change in early memory access. Four themes accounted for most (40.2%) of the earliest dreams recalled-being chased (14.0%), falling (11.4%), flying (9.4%), and encountering an evil force (5.3%)-and were interpretable as consistent with Freud's claim that such dreams arise from early infantile experiences. Results support the stress-acceleration hypothesis of nightmares, which stipulates that a foreshortening of the infantile amnesia period contributes to nightmares by increasing access to intense primordial feelings and memory fragments that are normally forgotten because of infantile amnesia processes.

Recollection and familiarity in aging individuals: Gaining insight into relationships with medial temporal lobe structural integrity	HIPPOCAMPUS			English	Article						aging; recollection; familiarity; structural neuroimaging	MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; RECOGNITION MEMORY; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; DECISION-PROCESSES; CORTEX FUNCTION; REMEMBER-KNOW; OLDER-ADULTS; HIPPOCAMPUS; LESIONS; MR	Dual-process theories posit that two separate processes are involved in recognition, namely recollection and familiarity. Studies investigating the neuroanatomical substrates of these two processes have frequently revealed that, while recollection is functionally linked with the hippocampus, familiarity appears to be associated with perirhinal and/or entorhinal cortices integrity. Interestingly these regions are known to be sensitive to normal and neuropathological aging processes. The objective of this study was to examine the effects of aging on recollection and familiarity performance, as well as to investigate associations with the rate of false alarms. In older individuals, we further aimed to explore relationships between these recognition variables and structural integrity of the hippocampus and the entorhinal and perirhinal cortices. Younger (N556) and older (N559) adults were tested on a computerized recollection and familiarity task. In a separate session, older adults (N556) underwent a structural MRI. Hippocampal, entorhinal and perihinal cortices volumes were automatically segmented and then manually corrected to ensure validity of the volumetric assessment. Regional volumes were normalized for total intracranial volume. While the overall recognition performance did not significantly differ across groups, our results reveal a decrease in recollection, together with an increase in familiarity in older adults. The increase reliance on familiarity was significantly and positively associated with the rate of false alarms. In the older adult sample, significant positive associations were found between recollection estimates and normalized hippocampal volumes. The normalized total hippocampal volume accounted for 25% of the variance in recollection performance. No correlation was found between any recognition variables and perirhinal or entorhinal cortices volumes. Overall, our results suggest that the age-related impairment in recollection is linked with reduced hippocampal structural integrity.

J	Hakala, AK; Fergusson, D; Kimmelman, J				Hakala, Amanda K.; Fergusson, Dean; Kimmelman, Jonathan			Nonpublication of Trial Results for New Neurological Drugs: A Systematic Review	ANNALS OF NEUROLOGY			English	Review							RATES	Objective: To evaluate nonpublication rates among trials of new successful and unsuccessful neurological drugs. Methods: "Licensed" drugs consisted of all novel agents receiving US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) licensure 2005-2012 inclusive in seven neurological disorders. "Stalled" drugs included all experimental agents tested in the same domains that had at least one completed phase III trial in the same time frame, but failed to receive FDA approval. Trials of these drugs were included in our sample if their primary outcome collection occurred before October 1, 2010. We determined the publication status of eligible trials using searches of clinicaltrials.gov, Google Scholar, PubMed, Embase, sponsor websites, and direct electronic query of trial contacts and sponsors. The primary outcome was time to journal publication (or results reporting in other media) after study completion. Results: The adjusted hazard ratio for publication was 1.79 (95% confidence interval, 1.20-2.67) in favor of licensed drugs. Based on the criteria for nonpublication in this report, 14,092 and 33,882 volunteers participated in unpublished trials of licensed and stalled neurological drugs, respectively. Result data were not publicly available in any form for 10% (16 of 163) and 46% (94 of 203) of trials of licensed and stalled drugs, respectively. Interpretation: Results of trials for stalled drugs are heavily under-reported. This deprives research and care communities of evidence about pathophysiology, drug class effects, and the value of surrogate endpoints in trials.

Sublethal Oligodendrocyte Injury: A Reversible Condition in Multiple Sclerosis?	ANNALS OF NEUROLOGY			English	Article							CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; SMALL NUCLEOLAR RNAS; METABOLIC STRESS; MITOCHONDRIAL DYSFUNCTION; NEUROLOGICAL DEFICITS; PROTEIN; CELLS; ACTIVATION; MYELINATION; LESIONS	Objective: Degeneration of oligodendroglial distal processes has been identified as an early event in multiple sclerosis (MS) lesion development. Our objective was to further define the development of the "dying-back" oligodendrocyte lesion in situ and to model the development and potential reversibility of such responses using dissociated cultures of adult human brain-derived oligodendrocytes. Methods: In situ analyses were performed on glutaraldehyde-fixed thin sections of clinically acute and pathologically active cases of MS. In vitro studies were conducted using adult human brain-derived oligodendrocytes challenged by metabolic stress conditions (low nutrient/glucose). Results: In situ analyses indicated a spectrum of myelin changes in the presence of morphologically intact oligodendrocytes; these included degeneration of the inner cytoplasmic tongue with increasing sizes of intramyelinic bleb formation that could result in radial fractures of the myelin sheath. Macrophages with ingested myelin fragments were identified only once the fragmentation was established. In vitro studies indicated that oligodendrocyte process retraction, which was linked to reduced glycolytic respiratory activity, is reversible until a critical time point. Subsequent cell death was not linked to caspase-3-dependent programs. Gene expression studies conducted at the latest reversible time point revealed reduced expression of pathways associated with cell process outgrowth and myelination, as well as with metabolic activity. Interpretation: Our findings reveal the potential to protect and possibly restore myelin elaborated by existent oligodendrocytes in early and evolving MS lesions, and suggest the necessity of ongoing studies of the mechanisms underlying subsequent adult human oligodendrocyte cell death.

Changes in the correlation between spatial and temporal source memory performance and BOLD activity across the adult lifespan	CORTEX			English	Article						Lifespan; Source memory; Encoding; Retrieval; fMRI	AGE-RELATED DIFFERENCES; PARTIAL LEAST-SQUARES; PREFRONTAL CORTEX ACTIVITY; EVENT-RELATED FMRI; OLDER-ADULTS; CONTEXT RETRIEVAL; EPISODIC MEMORY; WORKING-MEMORY; BRAIN ACTIVITY; ANTERIOR HIPPOCAMPUS	Studies investigating age-related functional differences associated with source memory have recently focused on the importance of clarifying the relationship between effects of age and performance on memory-related brain activations. One methodological challenge has been in discriminating between effects of age on memory-related brain activations that are independent from age-related differences in performance. In the current study, event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to identify brain activity during spatial and temporal source encoding and retrieval across the adult life span. We used multivariate behavior partial least squares (B-PLS) to identify patterns of brain activity during source encoding and source retrieval that were associated with age and/or retrieval accuracy. The PLS analysis identified three significant effects. The first effect indicated that encoding and retrieval activity in fusiform, middle occipital temporal and inferior parietal cortices increased with age and decreased with performance. The second effect showed that dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and limbic activity increased with age at encoding, and increased with performance at retrieval. The third effect indicated that activity in right ventrolateral prefrontal and bilateral hippocampus increased with age during retrieval and was differentially related to performance during encoding versus retrieval. We conclude that although some age-related differences in brain activity observed during source encoding and retrieval are associated with individual differences in performance, age-related differences in prefrontal and hippocampal areas exhibit more complex patterns of interactions between age, performance, and phase-related activity.

OBJECTIVE To refine the existing clinically based recursive partitioning analysis (RPA) model by incorporating molecular variables. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS NRG Oncology RTOG 0525 specimens (n = 452) were analyzed for protein biomarkers representing key pathways in GBM by a quantitative molecular microscopy-based approach with semiquantitative immunohistochemical validation. Prognostic significance of each protein was examined by single-marker and multimarker Cox regression analyses. To reclassify the prognostic risk groups, significant protein biomarkers on single-marker analysis were incorporated into an RPA model consisting of the same clinical variables (age, Karnofsky Performance Status, extent of resection, and neurologic function) as the existing RTOG RPA. The new RPA model (NRG-GBM-RPA) was confirmed using traditional immunohistochemistry in an independent data set (n = 176). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Overall survival (OS). RESULTS In 452 specimens, MGMT (hazard ratio [HR], 1.81; 95% CI, 1.37-2.39; P < .001), survivin (HR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.04-1.76; P = .02), c-Met (HR, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.06-2.23; P = .02), pmTOR (HR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.60-0.97; P = .03), and Ki-67 (HR, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.10-1.78; P = .007) protein levels were found to be significant on single-marker multivariate analysis of OS. To refine the existing RPA, significant protein biomarkers together with clinical variables (age, Karnofsky Performance Status, extent of resection, and neurological function) were incorporated into a new model. Of 166 patients used for the new NRG-GBM-RPA model, 97 (58.4%) were male (mean [SD] age, 55.7 [12.0] years). Higher MGMT protein level was significantly associated with decreased MGMT promoter methylation and vice versa (1425.1 formethylated vs 1828.0 for unmethylated; P < .001). Furthermore, MGMT protein expression (HR, 1.84; 95% CI, 1.38-2.43; P < .001) had greater prognostic value for OS compared with MGMT promoter methylation (HR, 1.77; 95% CI, 1.28-2.44; P < .001). The refined NRG-GBM-RPA consisting of MGMT protein, c-Met protein, and age revealed greater separation of OS prognostic classes compared with the existing clinically based RPA model and MGMT promoter methylation in NRG Oncology RTOG 0525. The prognostic significance of the NRG-GBM-RPA was subsequently confirmed in an independent data set (n = 176). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This new NRG-GBM-RPA model improves outcome stratification over both the current RTOG RPA model and MGMT promoter methylation, respectively, for patients with GBM treated with radiation and temozolomide and was biologically validated in an independent data set. The revised RPA has the potential to contribute to improving the accurate assessment of prognostic groups in patients with GBM treated with radiation and temozolomide and to influence clinical decision making.

Estimating Survival in Patients With Lung Cancer and Brain Metastases An Update of the Graded Prognostic Assessment for Lung Cancer Using Molecular Markers (Lung-molGPA)	JAMA ONCOLOGY			English	Article							STEREOTACTIC RADIOSURGERY; SECONDARY ANALYSIS; RADIATION-THERAPY; TRIAL; CHEMOTHERAPY; STATISTICS	IMPORTANCE Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality in the United States and worldwide. As systemic therapies improve, patients with lung cancer live longer and thus are at increased risk for brain metastases. Understanding how prognosis varies across this heterogeneous patient population is essential to individualize care and design future clinical trials. OBJECTIVE To update the current Diagnosis-Specific Graded Prognostic Assessment (DS-GPA) for patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and brain metastases. The DS-GPA is based on data from patients diagnosed between 1985 and 2005, and we set out to update it by incorporating more recently reported gene and molecular alteration data for patients with NSCLC and brain metastases. This new index is called the Lung-molGPA. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This is a multi-institutional retrospective database analysis of 2186 patients diagnosed between 2006 and 2014 with NSCLC and newly diagnosed brain metastases. The multivariable analyses took place between December 2015 and May 2016, and all prognostic factors were weighted for significance by hazard ratios. Significant factors were included in the updated Lung-molGPA prognostic index. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The main outcomewas survival. Multiple Cox regression was used to select and weight prognostic factors in proportion to their hazard ratios. Log rank tests were used to compare adjacent classes and to compare overall survival for adenocarcinoma vs nonadenocarcinoma groups. RESULTS The original DS-GPA was based on 4 factors found in 1833 patients with NSCLC and brain metastases diagnosed between 1985 and 2005: patient age, Karnofsky Performance Status, extracranial metastases, and number of brain metastases. The patients studied for the creation of the DS-GPA had a median survival of 7 months from the time of initial treatment of brain metastases. To design the updated Lung-molGPA, we analyzed data from 2186 patients from 2006 through 2014 with NSCLC and newly diagnosed brain metastases (1521 adenocarcinoma and 665 nonadenocarcinoma). Significant prognostic factors included the original 4 factors used in the DS-GPA index plus 2 new factors: EGFR and ALK alterations in patients with adenocarcinoma (mutation status was not routinely tested for nonadenocarcinoma). The overall median survival for the cohort in the present study was 12 months, and those with NSCLC-adenocarcinoma and Lung-molGPA scores of 3.5 to 4.0 had a median survival of nearly 4 years. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In recent years, patient survival and physicians' ability to predict survival in NSCLC with brain metastases has improved significantly. The updated Lung-molGPA incorporating gene alteration data into the DS-GPA is a user-friendly tool that may facilitate clinical decision making and appropriate stratification of future clinical trials.

Recessive Mutations in POLR3B Encoding RNA Polymerase III Subunit Causing Diffuse Hypomyelination in Patients with 4H Leukodystrophy with Polymicrogyria and Cataracts	CLINICAL NEURORADIOLOGY			English	Article						Hypomyelination; 4H leukodystrophy; Magnetic resonance imaging; Children; Polymicrogyria; Cataract	COMPOUND HETEROZYGOUS MUTATIONS; HYPOGONADOTROPIC HYPOGONADISM; CATALYTIC SUBUNIT; BASAL GANGLIA; LEUKOENCEPHALOPATHY; HYPODONTIA; ATROPHY; CEREBELLUM; DISORDERS; DISEASE	The diagnosis of 4H leukodystrophy (hypomyelination, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, and hypodontia) is based on clinical findings and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Recently, mutations of the genes encoding Pol III (RNA polymerase III) subunit A (POLR3A) and subunit B (POL3B) have been identified as the genetic causes of hypomyelination. We describe two Polish female siblings aged 5 and 10 years with compound heterozygous mutations in POLR3B. They both presented with similar clinical symptoms and MRI findings presenting as 4H leukodystrophy, and the association of polymicrogyria and cataract. According to our observation in young children with the absence of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, brain MRI pattern is very essential in proper early diagnosis of 4H leukodystrophy. All clinical and radiological results are of course helpful, however genetic conformation is always necessary.

Materials & methods: We used sequential ChIP-bisulfite-sequencing with an antibody to RNpolII-PS5 to map the state of methylation of actively transcribing transcription start sites (TSS). Results: TSS that RNApolII-PS5 physically bind to, are ubiquitously unmethylated. TSS that appear to be both heavily methylated and transcriptionally active are truly a mixture of unmethylated TSS with bound RNApolII-PS5 in some nuclei and unbound methylated TSS in other nuclei. Conclusion: TSS DNA methylation is universally inconsistent with transcription onset and could therefore serve as a digital count of the fraction of nuclei with methylation-silenced TSS.

The present study examined the longitudinal associations between diabetes complications and the risk and recurrence/persistence of depressive symptoms. Methods Data were from a prospective community cohort telephone survey of adults with diabetes (N = 1314). Diabetes complications and depressive symptoms were assessed via self-report (Diabetes Complications Index and Patient Health Questionnaire-9, respectively) at baseline and annually for 5 years. Statistical models adjusted for sociodemographic, lifestyle, and diabetes characteristics. Results The number of diabetes complications at baseline was positively associated with a greater risk of elevated depressive symptoms, with the highest risk found for those with four to six complications at baseline (risk ratio = 2.73, 95% confidence interval = 1.64-4.56). Cerebrovascular disease was the complication most strongly associated with incident depressive symptoms (risk ratio = 2.22, 95% confidence interval = 1.59-3.10). Coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, and neuropathy were also associated with the risk of depression, whereas foot problems and eye problems were not. In addition, a greater number of diabetes complications were associated with recurrent/persistent depression, though with a small effect size (r(2) = .02). A parallel process latent growth curve model indicated that increases in diabetes complications were associated with increases in depressive symptoms during the course of the follow-up period ( = .74, p < .001). Conclusions This study demonstrates the temporal relation between diabetes complications and depressive symptoms and underscores the psychological burden of diabetes complications by prospectively demonstrating the increased risk and recurrence of depressive symptoms associated with diabetes complications.

IMAGEN Consortium	Functional Neuroimaging Predictors of Self-Reported Psychotic Symptoms in Adolescents	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY			English	Article							VENTRAL STRIATAL ACTIVATION; ULTRA-HIGH RISK; COGNITIVE CONTROL; META-ANALYSIS; SCHIZOPHRENIA; METAANALYSIS; DISORDER; INDIVIDUALS; DYSFUNCTION; PRONENESS	Objective: This study investigated the neural correlates of psychotic-like experiences in youths during tasks involving inhibitory control, reward anticipation, and emotion processing. A secondary aim was to test whether these neurofunctional correlates of risk were predictive of psychotic symptoms 2 years later. Method: Functional imaging responses to three paradigms-the stop-signal, monetary incentive delay, and faces tasks were collected in youths at age 14, as part of the IMAGEN study. At baseline, youths from London and Dublin sites were assessed on psychotic-like experiences, and those reporting significant experiences were compared with matched control subjects. Significant brain activity differences between the groups were used to predict, with cross-validation, the presence of psychotic symptoms in the context of mood fluctuation at age 16, assessed in the full sample. These prediction analyses were conducted with the London-Dublin subsample (N=246) and the full sample (N=1,196). Results: Relative to control subjects, youths reporting psychotic-like experiences showed increased hippocampus/amygdala activity during processing of neutral faces and reduced dorsolateral prefrontal activity during failed inhibition. The most prominent regional difference for classifying 16-year-olds with mood fluctuation and psychotic symptoms relative to the control groups (those with mood fluctuations but no psychotic symptoms and those with no mood symptoms) was hyperactivation of the hippocampus/amygdala, when controlling for baseline psychotic-like experiences and cannabis use. Conclusions: The results stress the importance of the limbic network's increased response to neutral facial stimuli as a marker of the extended psychosis phenotype. These findings might help to guide early intervention strategies for at-risk youths.

J	Masi, L; Gignac, M				Masi, Laura; Gignac, Martin			ADHD and comorbid disorders in pedopsychiatry: Psychiatric problems, medical problems, learning disorders and developmental coordination disorder	ANNALES MEDICO-PSYCHOLOGIQUES			French	Article						Adolescents; Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD); Children; Comorbidity; Disruptive behaviour; Mood disorder; Psychiatric pathology	ATTENTION-DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; DEFICIT HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; POSTTRAUMATIC-STRESS-DISORDER; OPPOSITIONAL DEFIANT DISORDER; PEDIATRIC BIPOLAR DISORDER; SEVERE MOOD DYSREGULATION; LIMB MOVEMENT-DISORDER; RESTLESS LEGS SYNDROME; SPECTRUM DISORDERS; CONDUCT DISORDER	ADHD is a common disorder for children and is highly comorbid with a number of psychiatric and somatic disorders, which leads to important social consequences. Therefore, it is important to screen for the presence of other disorders when a diagnosis of ADHD is considered. Because of the associated pathologies, the clinical picture of the ADHD is more complex and represents a diagnostic challenge. Furthermore, the prognostic and the future of children with a comorbid ADHD is much more unfavorable than that of children with ADHD only. It is thus necessary to recognize the presentation of ADHD associated with various and frequently comorbid pathologies knowing that those will change according to age and the developmental stage. The objective of this article is to describe these comorbidities. We are going to discuss pathologies most often associated with ADHD and the impact of its symptomatology on psychiatric disorders, medical affections and other disorders such as learning disorder and developmental coordination disorder. Along these lines, we carried out a mini review of ADHD and comorbidities. Results showed that comorbid psychiatric disorders such as conduct disorders, mood disorders and anxiety are among the most frequently associated with ADHD in clinical practice. Disruptive disorders are the most common comorbidities found with ADHD. Among these disorders, oppositional defiant disorder must be distinguished from conduct disorders. Conduct disorders are highly comorbid with ADHD (in more than a third of the cases) and increase the severity of the clinical picture. When children show at the same time ADHD and a conduct disorder, they are at risk to have an antisocial personality disorder as well as addictive disorders in adulthood. Depressive disorders can be triggered by ADHD since these young patients have to face numerous failures and difficulties in their family, social and school lives. With respect to bipolar disorders, links exist with ADHD. Bipolar disorder and ADHD treatment is complex: both thymoregulators and medication of ADHD are necessary. Finally, anxiety disorders are concomitant in 33 % of ADHD children, an association which deteriorates the symptoms of inattention and distractibility. Furthermore, there is also some overlap between ADHD and addictive behavior, obsessive-compulsive disorder, tics, sleeping disorder and specific learning disorder. There is a high prevalence of the association between ADHD and addictive behaviors in connection with impulsiveness, lack of control, automedication and similarity in the neurobiological circuits. Children with an obsessive-compulsive disorder have ADHD in 33 % of the cases. Although treatments of ADHD and obsessive-compulsive disorder differ, they must be taken simultaneously. It seems that sleeping disorders are not co-occurring with ADHD but intrinsic. Besides, sleeping disorders during childhood can mime an ADHD and complicate the diagnosis to be established, in particular when restless legs syndrome or sleep apnea is present. The comorbidity of ADHD and specific learning disorders is high. Children with specific learning disorders have difficulties staying attentive and their academic performance is often below their full potential, just like the ADHD children. Therefore, clinicians who assess patients for ADHD have to systematically screen for the presence of specific learning disorders and vice versa. Likewise, autistic spectrum disorder and eating disorder are more and more recognized as comorbid entities. The DSM-IV made impossible the concomitance between autism spectrum disorders and ADHD. However, the DSM-5 did recognize the existence of this comorbidity. The association of those two pathologies results in more severe dysfunction for the children, but the treatment of ADHD is going to facilitate the medical care of autism spectrum disorders. ADHD is described as a risk factor for eating disorders. Besides, the co-occurrence of obesity with ADHD is connected to impulsiveness and the tendency to addictive behaviors. Relationships of ADHD with posttraumatic stress disorder and attachment disorder have also been noted. Similarities between ADHD and posttraumatic stress disorder can cause diagnostic errors. Indeed, for both disorders we find the following: agitation, irritability, hypervigilance, sleeping disorders, attention disorders and disorders in the executive functions. Therefore, during the assessment of a child with a clinical picture of ADHD, anamnesis must be completed with the search of traumatic events. On the other hand, attachment disorder can also be confused with ADHD. Difficult temperament can disrupt the process of attachment and is associated with a bigger risk of ADHD. Finally, other medical issues should be considered in the assessment of ADHD: brain injury, epilepsy and obesity for example. ADHD children with a co-occurring condition may be severely impaired and treatment is more complex. ADHD is strongly comorbid with a large number of psychiatric and physical pathologies. It is probably more a set of affections than a homogeneous clinical entity. The longitudinal studies of children with one or several comorbidities showed that the outcome of these children was unfavorable, the association of pathologies causing an important dysfunction. The explanations proposed for this strong tendency of comorbidity with ADHD are that comorbidities have the same risk factors (genetic and environmental) and/or that one of the disorder is a subcategory of another. This leads us to conclude that a better comprehension of the high rates of comorbidities with ADHD is essential to optimize treatment of this condition and prevent some of the negative outcomes associated with comorbid ADHD.

The electrophysiology of neuroHIV: A systematic review of EEG and MEG studies in people with HIV infection since the advent of highly-active antiretroviral therapy	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Review						HIV; Central nervous system infections; HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders; Electroencephalography; Magnetoencephalography	MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; HUMAN-IMMUNODEFICIENCY-VIRUS; Z-SCORE INDEX; RESTING-STATE; NEUROCOGNITIVE DISORDERS; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; CORTICAL SOURCES; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; OLDER-ADULTS	Objective: The Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) has an impact on the brain, even when the infection is well-controlled with modern highly-active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). While dementia is rare in those on HAART, milder cognitive impairment is common. The causes, patterns, and evolution of brain dysfunction in people living with HIV remain uncertain. We evaluate whether electrophysiological methods provide informative measures of brain dysfunction in this population. Methods: A systematic literature search identified studies that used EEG or MEG to evaluate persons living with HIV published between 1996 (when HAART became available) and 2016. Results: Twenty-eight studies were identified. Most involved small samples, and all but four were cross-sectional. Reduced amplitude of Event Related Potentials and decreased power in the alpha band at rest were the most frequent differences between people with and without HIV infection. Of the 16 studies that also assessed cognitive ability, 13 found a significant relationship between cognition and electrophysiological changes in the HIV+ groups. Five of those studies also reported a significant relationship with current immunosuppression, suggesting a direct effect of HIV on the brain. There were few longitudinal studies; whether these electrophysiological changes progress over time, or respond to treatment, remains unclear. Conclusions: EEG and MEG can provide useful information about brain dysfunction in people with HIV infection, but more consistent assessments of both cognition and EEG patterns, as well as longitudinal studies with larger, better characterized samples are needed.

However, EEG-fMRI sometimes show mesial temporal activation. We hypothesized that BOLD activation in the temporal neocortex is weaker than in the mesial structures, reflecting the fact that propagated activity has less metabolic demand than the original discharge. Methods: Twelve patients with epilepsy who have BOLD response in mesial temporal structures were selected from our EEG-fMRI database. We searched the temporal lobe ipsilateral to IEDs and checked whether there is positive BOLD response in the neocortex. Results: All IED types showed a BOLD response in the temporal neocortex ipsilateral to the mesial temporal BOLD response. T-values were higher in mesial temporal structures than in neocortex in 13/16 cases. Conclusions: Hemodynamic changes were observed in the mesial temporal lobe at the time of IEDs recorded from the temporal region on the scalp. The finding of smaller BOLD changes in the ipsilateral neocortex is in agreement with our hypothesis. (C) 2017 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The application of WGS is of particular relevance in neurology, as many conditions are difficult to diagnose. We conducted a worldwide, web-based survey to explore neurologists' views on the benefits of, and concerns regarding, the clinical use of WGS, as well as the resources necessary to implement it. Almost half of the 204 neurologists in the study treated mostly adult patients (48%), while the rest mainly children (37.3%), or both (14.7%). Epilepsy (73%) and headaches (57.8%) were the predominant conditions treated. Factor analysis brought out two profiles: neurologists who would offer WGS to their patients, and those who would not, or were not sure in which circumstances it should be offered. Neurologists considering the use of WGS as bringing more benefits than drawbacks currently used targeted genetic testing (P < 0.05) or treated mainly children (P < 0.05). WGS' benefits were directed towards the patients, while its risks were of a financial and legal nature. Furthermore, there was a correlation between respondents' current use of genetic tests and an anticipation of increased use in the future (P < 0.001). However, over half of respondents did not feel sufficiently informed to use WGS in their practice (53.5%). Our results highlight gaps in education, organization, and funding to support the use of WGS in neurology, and draw attention to the need for resources that could strongly contribute to more straightforward diagnoses and possibly better treatment of neurological conditions.

J	Nielsen, T				Nielsen, Tore			The Stress Acceleration Hypothesis of Nightmares	FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY			English	Article						nightmares; stress acceleration; affective disorders; infantile amnesia; adverse childhood experiences; trauma	ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES; EARLY-LIFE STRESS; MEDIAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; CROSS-SPECIES ANALYSIS; REPLICATION NCS-R; BAD DREAMS; REM-SLEEP; MATERNAL SEPARATION; INFANTILE AMNESIA; TRAUMATIC EVENTS	Adverse childhood experiences can deleteriously affect future physical and mental health, increasing risk for many illnesses, including psychiatric problems, sleep disorders, and, according to the present hypothesis, idiopathic nightmares. Much like post-traumatic nightmares, which are triggered by trauma and lead to recurrent emotional dreaming about the trauma, idiopathic nightmares are hypothesized to originate in early adverse experiences that lead in later life to the expression of early memories and emotions in dream content. Accordingly, the objectives of this paper are to (1) review existing literature on sleep, dreaming and nightmares in relation to early adverse experiences, drawing upon both empirical studies of dreaming and nightmares and books and chapters by recognized nightmare experts and (2) propose a new approach to explaining nightmares that is based upon the Stress Acceleration Hypothesis of mental illness. The latter stipulates that susceptibility to mental illness is increased by adversity occurring during a developmentally sensitive window for emotional maturation-the infantile amnesia period-that ends around age 31/2. Early adversity accelerates the neural and behavioral maturation of emotional systems governing the expression, learning, and extinction of fear memories and may afford short-term adaptive value. But it also engenders long-term dysfunctional consequences including an increased risk for nightmares. Two mechanisms are proposed: (1) disruption of infantile amnesia allows normally forgotten early childhood memories to influence later emotions, cognitions and behavior, including the common expression of threats in nightmares; (2) alterations of normal emotion regulation processes of both waking and sleep lead to increased fear sensitivity and less effective fear extinction. These changes influence an affect network previously hypothesized to regulate fear extinction during REM sleep, disruption of which leads to nightmares. This network consists of a fear circuit that includes amygdala, hippocampus, and medial prefrontal cortex and whose substantial overlap with the stress acceleration findings allows the latter to be incorporated into a wider, more developmentally coherent framework.

Our aim is to generate consensus among a group of experts regarding the optimal parameters, outcomes, and methods of estimating injury severity for pediatric trauma patients in low resource settings. Materials and methods: A systematic review of the literature was conducted to identify and compare existing injury scores used in pediatric patients. Qualitative data was extracted from the systematic review, including scoring parameters, settings and outcomes. In order to establish consensus regarding which of these elements are most adapted to pediatric patients in low-resource settings, they were subjected to a modified Delphi survey for external validation. The Delphi process is a structured communication technique that relies on a panel of experts to develop a systematic, interactive consensus method. We invited a group of 38 experts, including adult and pediatric surgeons, emergency physicians and anesthesiologists trauma team leaders from a level 1 trauma center in Montreal, Canada, and a pediatric referral trauma hospital in Santiago, Chile to participate in two successive rounds of our survey. Results: Consensus was reached regarding various features of an ideal pediatric trauma score. Specifically, our experts agreed pediatric trauma scoring tool should differ from its adult counterpart, that it can be derived from point of care data available at first assessment, that blood pressure is an important variable to include in a predictive model for pediatric trauma outcomes, that blood pressure is a late but specific marker of shock in pediatric patients, that pulse rate is a more sensitive marker of hemodynamic instability than blood pressure, that an assessment of airway status should be included as a predictive variable for pediatric trauma outcomes, that the AVPU classification of neurologic status is simple and reliable in the acute setting, and more so than GCS at all ages. Conclusion: Therefore, we conclude that an opportunity exists to develop a new pediatric trauma score, combining the above consensus-generating ideas, that would be best adapted for use in low-resource settings.

Validation of the MDS Research Criteria for Prodromal Parkinson's Disease: Longitudinal Assessment in a REM Sleep Behavior Disorder (RBD) Cohort	MOVEMENT DISORDERS			English	Article						Parkinson's disease; dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB); REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD); prodromal criteria	LEWY BODIES; TASK-FORCE; DIAGNOSIS; DEMENTIA; RISK; POPULATION; COMMUNITY; FEATURES; MARKERS; SCALE	Background: Recently, the International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society introduced the prodromal criteria for PD. Objectives Our study aimed to examine diagnostic accuracy of the criteria as well as the independence of prodromal markers to predict conversion to PD or dementia with Lewy bodies. Methods: This prospective cohort study was performed on 121 individuals with rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder who were followed annually for 1 to 12 years. Using data from a comprehensive panel of prodromal markers, likelihood ratio and post-test probability of the criteria were calculated at baseline and during each follow-up visit. Results: Forty-eight (39.7%) individuals with rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder converted to PD/dementia with Lewy bodies. The prodromal criteria had 81.3% sensitivity and 67.9% specificity for conversion to PD/dementia with Lewy bodies at 4-year follow-up. One year before conversion, sensitivity was 100%. The criteria predicted dementia with Lewy bodies with even higher accuracy than PD without dementia at onset. Those who met the threshold of prodromal criteria at baseline had significantly more rapid conversion into a neurodegenerative state (4.8 vs. 9.1 years; P < 0.001). Pair-wise combinations of different prodromal markers showed that markers were independent of one another. Conclusion: The prodromal criteria are a promising tool for predicting incidence of PD/dementia with Lewy bodies and conversion time in a rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder cohort, with high sensitivity and high specificity with long follow-up. Prodromal markers influence the overall likelihood ratio independently, allowing them to be reliably multiplied. Defining additional markers with high likelihood ratio, further studies with longitudinal assessment and testing thresholds in different target populations will improve the criteria.

Yet, it remains to be answered whether this synergism is the driving force behind Alzheimer disease (AD) dementia. Methods: We stratified 314 mild cognitive impairment individuals using [F-18]florbetapir positron emission tomography Ab imaging and cerebrospinal fluid p-tau. Regression and voxel-based logistic regression models with interaction terms evaluated 2-year changes in cognition and clinical status as a function of baseline biomarkers. Results: We found that the synergism between [F-18] florbetapir and p-tau, rather than their additive effects, was associated with the cognitive decline and progression to AD. Furthermore, voxel-based analysis revealed that temporal and inferior parietal were the regions where the synergism determined an increased likelihood of developing AD. Discussion: Together, the present results support that progression to AD dementia is driven by the synergistic rather than a mere additive effect between A beta and p-tau proteins.

The aim of this study was to investigate the corticobulbar projections from distinct motor cortical areas onto different nuclei of the reticular formation. Seven adult macaque monkeys were analysed for the location of corticobulbar axonal boutons, and one monkey for reticulospinal neurons' location. The anterograde tracer BDA was injected in the premotor cortex (PM), in the primary motor cortex (M1) or in the supplementary motor area (SMA), in 3, 3 and 1 monkeys respectively. BDA anterograde labelling of corticobulbar axons were analysed on brainstem histological sections and overlapped with adjacent Nissl-stained sections for cytoarchitecture. One adult monkey was analysed for retrograde CB tracer injected in C5-C8 hemispinal cord to visualise reticulospinal neurons. The corticobulbar axons formed bilateral terminal fields with boutons terminaux and en passant, which were quantified in various nuclei belonging to the Ponto-Medullary Reticular Formation (PMRF). The corticobulbar projections from both PM and SMA tended to end mainly ipsilaterally in PMRF, but contralaterally when originating from M1. Furthermore, the corticobulbar projection was less dense when originating from M1 than from non-primary motor areas (PM, SMA). The main nuclei of bouton terminals corresponded to the regions where reticulospinal neurons were located with CB retrograde tracing. In conclusion, the corticobulbar projection differs according to the motor cortical area of origin in density and laterality.

OBJECTIVE To quantify and describe levels and trends of mortality and nonfatal health outcomes among children and adolescents from 1990 to 2015 to provide a framework for policy discussion. EVIDENCE REVIEW Cause-specific mortality and nonfatal health outcomes were analyzed for 195 countries and territories by age group, sex, and year from 1990 to 2015 using standardized approaches for data processing and statistical modeling, with subsequent analysis of the findings to describe levels and trends across geography and time among children and adolescents 19 years or younger. A composite indicator of income, education, and fertility was developed (Socio-demographic Index [SDI]) for each geographic unit and year, which evaluates the historical association between SDI and health loss. FINDINGS Global child and adolescent mortality decreased from 14.18 million (95% uncertainty interval [UI], 14.09 million to 14.28 million) deaths in 1990 to 7.26 million (95% UI, 7.14 million to 7.39 million) deaths in 2015, but progress has been unevenly distributed. Countries with a lower SDI had a larger proportion of mortality burden (75%) in 2015 than was the case in 1990 (61%). Most deaths in 2015 occurred in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. Global trends were driven by reductions in mortality owing to infectious, nutritional, and neonatal disorders, which in the aggregate led to a relative increase in the importance of noncommunicable diseases and injuries in explaining global disease burden. The absolute burden of disability in children and adolescents increased 4.3%(95% UI, 3.1%-5.6%) from 1990 to 2015, with much of the increase owing to population growth and improved survival for children and adolescents to older ages. Other than infectious conditions, many top causes of disability are associated with long-term sequelae of conditions present at birth (eg, neonatal disorders, congenital birth defects, and hemoglobinopathies) and complications of a variety of infections and nutritional deficiencies. Anemia, developmental intellectual disability, hearing loss, epilepsy, and vision loss are important contributors to childhood disability that can arise from multiple causes. Maternal and reproductive health remains a key cause of disease burden in adolescent females, especially in lower-SDI countries. In low-SDI countries, mortality is the primary driver of health loss for children and adolescents, whereas disability predominates in higher-SDI locations; the specific pattern of epidemiological transition varies across diseases and injuries. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Consistent international attention and investment have led to sustained improvements in causes of health loss among children and adolescents in many countries, although progress has been uneven. The persistence of infectious diseases in some countries, coupled with ongoing epidemiologic transition to injuries and noncommunicable diseases, require all countries to carefully evaluate and implement appropriate strategies to maximize the health of their children and adolescents and for the international community to carefully consider which elements of child and adolescent health should be monitored.

Skin Conductance Responses and Neural Activations During Fear Conditioning and Extinction Recall Across Anxiety Disorders	JAMA PSYCHIATRY			English	Article							POSTTRAUMATIC-STRESS-DISORDER; ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; SOCIAL ANXIETY; GENERALIZED ANXIETY; HORMONAL CONTRACEPTIVES; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; PTSD; PHOBIA; AMYGDALA; WOMEN	IMPORTANCE The fear conditioning and extinction neurocircuitry has been extensively studied in healthy and clinical populations, with a particular focus on posttraumatic stress disorder. Despite significant overlap of symptoms between posttraumatic stress disorder and anxiety disorders, the latter has received less attention. Given that dysregulated fear levels characterize anxiety disorders, examining the neural correlates of fear and extinction learning may shed light on the pathogenesis of underlying anxiety disorders. OBJECTIVES To investigate the psychophysiological and neural correlates of fear conditioning and extinction recall in anxiety disorders and to document how these features differ as a function of multiple diagnoses or anxiety severity. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This investigation was a cross-sectional, case-control, functional magnetic resonance imaging study at an academic medical center. Participants were healthy controls and individuals with at least 1 of the following anxiety disorders: generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, specific phobia, and panic disorder. The study dates were between March 2013 and May 2015. EXPOSURES Two-day fear conditioning and extinction paradigm. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Skin conductance responses, blood oxygenation level-dependent responses, trait anxiety scores from the State Trait Anxiety Inventory-Trait Form, and functional connectivity. RESULTS This study included 21 healthy controls (10 women) and 61 individuals with anxiety disorders (36 women). P values reported for the neuroimaging results are all family wise error corrected. Skin conductance responses during extinction recall did not differ between individuals with anxiety disorders and healthy controls (eta p(2) = 0.001, P = .79), where eta p(2) is partial eta squared. The anxiety group had lower activation of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) during extinction recall (eta p(2) = 0.178, P = .02). A similar hypoactive pattern was found during early conditioning (eta p(2) = 0.106, P = .009). The vmPFC hypoactivation was associated with anxiety symptom severity (r = -0.420, P = .01 for conditioning and r = -0.464, P = .004 for extinction recall) and the number of co-occuring anxiety disorders diagnosed (eta p(2) = 0.137, P = .009 for conditioning and eta p(2) = 0.227, P = .004 for extinction recall). Psychophysiological interaction analyses revealed that the fear network connectivity differed between healthy controls and the anxiety group during fear learning (eta p(2) range between 0.088 and 0.176 and P range between 0.02 and 0.003) and extinction recall (eta p(2) range between 0.111 and 0.235 and P range between 0.02 and 0.002). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Despite no skin conductance response group differences during extinction recall, brain activation patterns between anxious and healthy individuals differed. These findings encourage future studies to examine the conditions longitudinally and in the context of treatment trials to improve and guide therapeutics via advanced neurobiological understanding of each disorder.

Molecular weight, reduced temperature, reduced pressure, critical compressibility factor and acentric factor are selected as input parameters and the surface tension is designated as the output parameter. An extensive database including 868 experimental data points for surface tension of 61 ILs are considered to develop the LSSVM model which the adjustable parameters of the model are calculated by a genetic algorithm programming. The proposed model exhibits good accuracy with the average absolute relative deviation of 1.41, 1.74 and 1.54% for train set, test set, and total data, respectively. The Leverage method is employed to check the validity of the model. The results show that the majority of data points are located in a standard error domain demonstrating statistical acceptability of the model and only 3.6% of data points are recognized as suspected data. To evaluate the effects of input parameters on the surface tension of ILs, a sensitivity analysis is performed. The results show that the critical compressibility factor of ILs with relative importance of 22.97% has the greatest effect on the surface tension of ionic liquids. Finally, the effects of temperature and the total number of carbon in cation side alkyl chain on the surface tension are predicted by the proposed model. The model exhibits a monotonic decrease for surface tension with increasing temperature. Moreover, it well predicts the effects of the total number of carbon atoms in cation side alkyl chain on the surface tension. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Modern recording methods and advanced computational analyses of scalp electroencephalography (EEG) have opened a possibility to study if comparable changes are also observed in the human neonatal brain. We recruited mothers using SRI during pregnancy (n = 22) and controls (n = 62). Mood and anxiety of mothers, newborn neurology, and newborn cortical function (EEG) were assessed. The EEG parameters were compared between newborns exposed to drugs versus controls, followed by comparisons of newborn EEG features with maternal psychiatric assessments. Neurological assessment showed subtle abnormalities in the SRI-exposed newborns. The computational EEG analyses disclosed a reduced interhemispheric connectivity, lower cross-frequency integration, as well as reduced frontal activity at low-frequency oscillations. These effects were not related to maternal depression or anxiety. Our results suggest that antenatal serotonergic treatment might change newborn brain function in a manner compatible with the recent experimental studies. The present EEG findings suggest links at the level of neuronal activity between human studies and animal experiments. These links will also enable bidirectional translation in future studies on the neuronal mechanisms and long-term neurodevelopmental effects of early SRI exposure.

These velocities can be obtained noninvasively using Doppler ultrasound (US). However, small vessels situated in the liver are difficult to identify and follow in US. We propose a multimodal fusion approach that non-rigidly registers a 3D geometric mesh model of the hepatic arteries obtained from preoperative MR angiography (MRA) acquisitions with intra-operative 3D US imaging. The proposed fusion tool integrates 3 imaging modalities: an arterial MRA, a portal phase MRA and an intra-operative 3D US. Preoperatively, the arterial phase MRA is used to generate a 3D model of the hepatic arteries, which is then non-rigidly co-registered with the portal phase MRA. Once the intra-operative 3D US is acquired, we register it with the portal MRA using a vessel-based rigid initialization followed by a non-rigid registration using an image-based metric based on linear correlation of linear combination. Using the combined non-rigid transformation matrices, the 3D mesh model is fused with the 3D US. 3D US and multi-phase MRA images acquired from 10 porcine models were used to test the performance of the proposed fusion tool. Unimodal registration of the MRA phases yielded a target registration error (TRE) of mm. Initial rigid alignment of the portal MRA and 3D US yielded a mean TRE of mm, which was significantly reduced to mm () after affine image-based registration. The following deformable registration step allowed for further decrease of the mean TRE to mm. The proposed tool could facilitate visualization and localization of these vessels when using 3D US intra-operatively for either intravascular or percutaneous interventions to avoid vessel perforation.

A Novel MRI Biomarker of Spinal Cord White Matter Injury: T2*-Weighted White Matter to Gray Matter Signal Intensity Ratio	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY			English	Article							CERVICAL SPONDYLOTIC MYELOPATHY; OF-THE-ART; MULTIPLE-SCLEROSIS; MAGNETIZATION-TRANSFER; DISEASE SEVERITY; IN-VIVO; BRAIN; ANISOTROPY; CONTRAST; ATROPHY	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: T2*-weighted imaging provides sharp contrast between spinal cord GM and WM, allowing their segmentation and cross-sectional area measurement. Injured WM demonstrates T2*WI hyperintensity but requires normalization for quantitative use. We introduce T2*WI WM/GM signal-intensity ratio and compare it against cross-sectional area, the DTI metric fractional anisotropy, and magnetization transfer ratio in degenerative cervical myelopathy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty-eight patients with degenerative cervical myelopathy and 40 healthy subjects underwent 3T MR imaging, covering C1-C7. Metrics were automatically extracted at maximally compressed and uncompressed rostral/caudal levels. Normalized metrics were compared with t tests, area under the curve, and logistic regression. Relationships with clinical measures were analyzed by using Pearson correlation and multiple linear regression. RESULTS: The maximally compressed level cross-sectional area demonstrated superior differences (P = 1 x 10(-13)), diagnostic accuracy (area under the curve = 0.890), and univariate correlation with the modified Japanese Orthopedic Association score (0.66). T2*WI WM/GM showed strong differences (rostral: P = 8 x 10(-7); maximally compressed level: P = 1 x 10(-11); caudal: P = 1 x 10(-4)), correlations (modified Japanese Orthopedic Association score; rostral: -0.52; maximally compressed level: -0.59; caudal: -0.36), and diagnostic accuracy (rostral: 0.775; maximally compressed level: 0.860; caudal: 0.721), outperforming fractional anisotropy and magnetization transfer ratio in most comparisons and cross-sectional area at rostral/caudal levels. Rostral T2*WI WM/GM showed the strongest correlations with focal motor (-0.45) and sensory (-0.49) deficits and was the strongest independent predictor of the modified Japanese Orthopedic Association score (P = .01) and diagnosis (P = .02) in multivariate models (R-2 = 0.59, P = 8 x 10(-13); area under the curve = 0.954, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: T2*WI WM/GM shows promise as a novel biomarker of WM injury. It detects damage in compressed and uncompressed regions and contributes substantially to multivariate models for diagnosis and correlation with impairment. Our multiparametric approach overcomes limitations of individual measures, having the potential to improve diagnostics, monitor progression, and predict outcomes.	[Martin, A. R.; Cadotte, D.

Based on the literature, several single-gene disorders, including Rett syndrome, Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome, PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome and tuberous sclerosis, are associated with a high prevalence of ASD. We estimated the prevalence of these four conditions in a large cohort of patients using whole-exome sequencing data from 2392 families (1800 quads and 592 trios) with ASD from the National Database for Autism Research. Seven patients carried a pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant in either TSC1, TSC2, PTEN, DHCR7 or MECP2, with 6 out of 7 reportable variants occurring in PTEN (1 in 399).

Trinucleotide repeat expansions in FMR1 abolish FMRP expression, leading to hyperactivation of ERK and mTOR signaling upstream of mRNA translation. Here we show that metformin, the most widely used drug for type 2 diabetes, rescues core phenotypes in Fmr1(-/y) mice and selectively normalizes ERK signaling, eIF4E phosphorylation and the expression of MMP-9. Thus, metformin is a potential FXS therapeutic.

A mutation in the TMEM65 gene results in mitochondrial myopathy with severe neurological manifestations	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF HUMAN GENETICS			English	Article							COMPLEX-I DEFICIENCY; DNA DISEASE; ADULTS; PROTEIN	Recent research has suggested that transmembrane protein 65 (TMEM65) is localized within the inner mitochondrial membrane. Little else is known about its function. In this study we investigated the location and function of TMEM65. Further, we report the functional consequences of a novel homozygous splice variant (c.472+1G>A) in the TMEM65 gene in a patient with mitochondrial encephalomyopathy. Here we investigated the location of TMEM65 by immunofluorescence staining of the protein and by immunoblotting of the isolated mitochondrial fractions in healthy fibroblasts and those from the patient. To study the function of TMEM65 we knocked down mRNA using TMEM65-specific siRNA, and measured mitochondrial function by enzymology, protein abundance and oxygen consumption rate in fibroblasts. Subcellular fractionation confirmed that the TMEM65 protein was present in the inner mitochondrial membrane. Knocking down TMEM65 expression in dermal fibroblasts severely affected mitochondrial content and respiration rate. Further evidence for the essential role of TMEM65 in mitochondrial function came from the demonstration of severe cellular and clinical consequences resulting from the novel TMEM65 gene mutation. In conclusion, these findings suggest that TMEM65, an inner mitochondrial membrane protein, plays a significant role in mitochondrial respiratory chain function. We also provide the first evidence that a mutation in the TMEM65 gene results in mitochondrial dysfunction and a severe mitochondrial encephalomyopathy phenotype.

Effects of tissue and gender on macromolecule suppressed gamma-aminobutyric acid	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF IMAGING SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						GABA; gender; grey matter; tissue; white matter	MAGNETIC-RESONANCE-SPECTROSCOPY; IN-VIVO DETECTION; HUMAN BRAIN; GABA CONCENTRATION; WHITE-MATTER; SENSORIMOTOR CORTEX; MEGA-PRESS; 3 TESLA; REPRODUCIBILITY; MOTION	The aims of this study are to determine the ratio of concentration of GABA in grey matter to concentration of GABA in white matter (GABA(GM)/GABA(WM)) and compare with literature values, and to investigate gender-related differences in GABA in healthy subjects. Twenty healthy subjects were scanned using a motion and shim navigated MEGA-SPECIAL MRS sequence. For every subject, two acquisitions were performed for each of two regions, the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and medial-parietal cortex (PAR), with the order interleaved. Absolute GABA (GABA(H2O)) and GABA/Cr concentrations were measured using LCModel. LCModel fitting revealed an overall average Cramer-Rao Lower Bounds approximate to 10%. The GABA(GM)/GABA(WM) for both GABA(H2O) and GABA/Cr are 3 and 1.5, respectively, and in agreement with the literature. The ACC revealed no gender-related differences in GABA. The PAR revealed time-related changes in concentrations of GABA in male participants and thus gender-related differences. The higher concentration of GABA in GM than in WM found in this study and literature might be reflective of heterogeneous distribution of GABA around the brain. The gender- and time-related differences in the PAR emphasize that gender- and time-matching are critical for GABA scans.

New method: An implantable receive-only surface radiofrequency coil (iCoil) was designed to be fitted subcutaneously, directly onto to the rat skull surface during the intracerebral cannulation procedure. The coil is fixed in place using acrylic dental cement anchored to four screws threaded into the skull. To demonstrate the use of this coil system in situ, whole-brain functional MRI scans were acquired during various stimuli, including intracranial microinfusions of bicuculline and morphine in the prefrontal cortex and ventral tegmental area, respectively. Results/Comparison to other methods: SNR performance of the iCoil was superior to three commercially available coils, in some instances by a factor of two. Widespread BOLD activation was observed in response to bicuculline and morphine microinfusions. Conclusion: A new approach was demonstrated for high-SNR MR imaging of the brain in rats with intracranial implants using an implantable surface coil. This approach enables mapping the functional response to highly targeted stimuli such as intracranial microinfusions. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Mechanisms of Retinal Damage after Ocular Alkali Burns	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PATHOLOGY			English	Article							TUMOR-NECROSIS-FACTOR; BOSTON KERATOPROSTHESIS; EYE BURNS; IN-VITRO; GLAUCOMA; PROTECTION; CYTOKINES; EMERGENCY; ENDOTOXIN; THERAPY	Alkali burns to the eye constitute a leading cause of worldwide blindness. In recent case series, corneal transplantation revealed unexpected damage to the retina and optic nerve in chemically burned eyes. We investigated the physical, biochemical, and immunological components of retinal injury after alkali burn and explored a novel neuroprotective regimen suitable for prompt administration in emergency departments. Thus, in vivo pH, oxygen, and oxidation reduction measurements were performed in the anterior and posterior segment of mouse and rabbit eyes using implantable microsensors. Tissue inflammation was assessed by immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry. The experiments confirmed that the retinal damage is not mediated by direct effect of the alkali, which is effectively buffered by the anterior segment. Rather, pH, oxygen, and oxidation reduction changes were restricted to the cornea and the anterior chamber, where they caused profound uveal inflammation and release of proinflammatory cytokines. The latter rapidly diffuse to the posterior segment, triggering retinal damage. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha was identified as a key proinflammatory mediator of retinal ganglion cell death. Blockade, by either monoclonal antibody or tumor necrosis factor receptor gene knockout, reduced inflammation and retinal ganglion cell loss. Intraocular pressure elevation was not observed in experimental alkali burns. These findings illuminate the mechanism by which alkali burns cause retinal damage and may have importance in designing therapies for retinal protection.

Objectives: To investigate whether markers of obstructive sleep apnea severity are associated with gray matter changes among middle-aged and older individuals. Methods: Seventy-one subjects (ages, 55-76 yr; apnea-hypopnea index, 0.2-96.6 events/h) were evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging. Two techniques were used: (1) voxel-based morphometry, which measures gray matter volume and concentration; and (2) FreeSurfer (an open source software suite) automated segmentation, which estimates the volume of predefined cortical/subcortical regions and cortical thickness. Regression analyses were performed between gray matter characteristics and markers of obstructive sleep apnea severity (hypoxemia, respiratory disturbances, and sleep fragmentation). Measurements and Main Results: Subjects had few symptoms, that is, sleepiness, depression, anxiety, and cognitive deficits. Although no association was found with voxel-based morphometry, FreeSurfer revealed increased gray matter with obstructive sleep apnea. Higher levels of hypoxemia correlated with increased volume and thickness of the left lateral prefrontal cortex as well as increased thickness of the right frontal pole, the right lateral parietal lobules, and the left posterior cingulate cortex. Respiratory disturbances positively correlated with right amygdala volume, and more severe sleep fragmentation was associated with increased thickness of the right inferior frontal gyrus. Conclusions: Gray matter hypertrophy and thickening were associated with hypoxemia, respiratory disturbances, and sleep fragmentation. These structural changes in a group of middle-aged and older individuals may represent adaptive/reactive brain mechanisms attributed to a presymptomatic stage of obstructive sleep apnea.

To solve this issue, we used auditory-evoked EEG responses to assess novelty detection (MMN component) and involuntary attentional orientation (P3 component) induced by socially-relevant, human-produced, biological sounds and acoustically-matched control stimuli in children with ASD and controls. Results show that early sensory and novelty processing of biological stimuli are preserved in ASD, but that automatic attentional orientation for biological sounds is markedly altered. These results support the notion that at least some cognitive processes of ASD are specifically altered when it comes to processing social stimuli.

Methods: First, it formulates a novel state-space representation for the joint dynamic stiffness modeled by a parallel-cascade structure with a concise parameter set that provides a direct link between the state-space representation matrices and the parallel-cascade parameters. Second, it presents a subspace method for the identification of the new state-space model that involves two steps: 1) the decomposition of the intrinsic and reflex pathways and 2) the identification of an impulse response model of the intrinsic pathway and a Hammerstein model of the reflex pathway. Results: Extensive simulation studies demonstrate that SDSS has significant performance advantages over some other methods. Thus, SDSS was more robust under high noise conditions, converging where others failed; it was more accurate, giving estimates with lower bias and random errors. The method also worked well in practice and yielded high-quality estimates of intrinsic and reflex stiffnesses when applied to experimental data at three muscle activation levels. Conclusion: The simulation and experimental results demonstrate that SDSS accurately decomposes the intrinsic and reflex torques and provides accurate estimates of physiologically meaningful parameters. Significance: SDSS will be a valuable tool for studying joint stiffness under functionally important conditions. It has important clinical implications for the diagnosis, assessment, objective quantification, and monitoring of neuromuscular diseases that change the muscle tone.

In particular, neuronal habituation processes have been shown to be altered in FXS patients. Yet, while such deficits have been primarily explored using auditory stimuli, less is known in the visual modality. Here, we investigated the putative alteration of repetition suppression using faces in FXS patients compared to controls that had the same age distribution. Electroencephalographic (EEG) signals were acquired while participants were presented with 18 different faces, each repeated ten times successively. The repetition suppression effect was probed by comparing the brain responses to the first and second presentation, based on task-evoked event related potentials (ERP) as well as on task-induced oscillatory activity. We found different patterns of habituation for controls and patients both in ERP and oscillatory power. While the N170 was not affected by face repetition in controls, it was altered in FXS patients. Conversely, while a repetition suppression effect was observed in the theta band (4-8 Hz) over frontal and parieto-occipital areas in controls, it was not seen in FXS patients. These results provide the first evidence for diminished ERP and oscillatory habituation effects in response to face repetitions in FXS. These findings extend previous observations of impairments in learning mechanisms and may be linked to deficits in the maturation processes of synapses caused by the mutation. The present study contributes to bridging the gap between animal models of synaptic plasticity dysfunctions and human research in FXS.

BACKGROUND Flosequinan was the first oral vasodilator to be used in the clinic to augment the effects of digitalis, diuretics, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in heart failure. However, the drug activated neurohormonal systems and exerted both positive inotropic and chronotropic effects, raising concerns about its safety during long-term use. METHODS Following a run-in period designed to minimize the risk of tachycardia, we randomly assigned 2,354 patients in New York Heart Association functional class III to IV heart failure and with an ejection fraction <= 35% to receive long-term treatment with placebo or flosequinan (75 or 100 mg/day) in addition to their usual therapy. The primary outcome was allcause mortality. RESULTS The trial was terminated after a recommendation of the Data and Safety Monitoring Board, because during an average of 10 months of follow-up, 192 patients died in the placebo group and 255 patients died in the flosequinan group (hazard ratio: 1.39, 95% confidence interval: 1.15 to 1.67; p = 0.0006). Flosequinan also increased the risk of disease progression, which was paralleled by drug-related increases in heart rate and neurohormonal activation. However, during the first month, patients in the flosequinan group were more likely to report an improvement in well-being and less likely to experience worsening heart failure. Similarly, during the month following drug withdrawal at the end of the trial, patients withdrawn from flosequinan were more likely than those withdrawn from placebo to report symptoms of or to require treatment for worsening heart failure. CONCLUSIONS Although flosequinan produced meaningful symptomatic benefits during short-and long-term treatment, the drug increased the risk of death in patients with severe chronic heart failure.

Neuronal population coding of perceived and memorized visual features in the lateral prefrontal cortex	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							SPATIAL WORKING-MEMORY; FEATURE-BASED ATTENTION; NEURAL MECHANISMS; HUMAN BRAIN; MONKEY; REPRESENTATION; INACTIVATION; INFORMATION; PERFORMANCE; LOCATIONS	The primate lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) encodes visual stimulus features while they are perceived and while they are maintained in working memory. However, it remains unclear whether perceived and memorized features are encoded by the same or different neurons and population activity patterns. Here we record LPFC neuronal activity while monkeys perceive the motion direction of a stimulus that remains visually available, or memorize the direction if the stimulus disappears. We find neurons with a wide variety of combinations of coding strength for perceived and memorized directions: some neurons encode both to similar degrees while others preferentially or exclusively encode either one. Reading out the combined activity of all neurons, a machine-learning algorithm reliably decode the motion direction and determine whether it is perceived or memorized. Our results indicate that a functionally diverse population of LPFC neurons provides a substrate for discriminating between perceptual and mnemonic representations of visual features.

The conclusions and recommendations of a consensus conference of how best to integrate the growing body of molecular genetic information into tumor classifications and, more importantly, for future treatment of pediatric LGGs are summarized here. There is uniform agreement that molecular characterization must be incorporated into classification and is increasingly critical for appropriate management. Molecular-targeted therapies should be integrated expeditiously, but also carefully into the management of these tumors and success measured not only by radiographic responses or stability, but also by functional outcomes. These trials need to be carried out with the caveat that the long-term impact of molecularly targeted therapy on the developing nervous system, especially with long duration treatment, is essentially unknown.

The aim of this study was to develop and validate a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scoring system for 4H. A scoring system (0-54) was developed to quantify hypomyelination and atrophy of different brain regions. Pons diameter and bicaudate ratio were included as measures of cerebral and brainstem atrophy, and reference values were determined using controls. Five independent raters completed the scoring system in 40 brain MRI scans collected from 36 patients with genetically proven 4H. Interrater reliability (IRR) and correlations between MRI scores, age, gross motor function, gender, and mutated gene were assessed. IRR for total MRI severity was found to be excellent (intraclass correlation coefficient: 0.87; 95% confidence interval: 0.80-0.92) but varied between different items with some (e.g., myelination of the cerebellar WM) showing poor IRR. Atrophy increased with age in contrast to hypomyelination scores. MRI scores (global, hypomyelination, and atrophy scores) significantly correlated with clinical handicap (p < 0.01 for all three items) and differed between the different genotypes. Our 4H MRI scoring system reliably quantifies hypomyelination and atrophy in patients with 4H, and MRI scores reflect clinical disease severity.

However, brain perfusion during rapid-eye movement (REM) sleep could be a sensitive marker of amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), as activation of REM sleep relies more on the cholinergic system. Methods: Eight subjects with aMCI, and 16 controls, underwent two single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) scans with tracer injected during REM sleep then wakefulness. Results: Perfusion in the anterior cingulate cortex was significantly decreased in aMCI cases compared to controls for both conditions. That defect was much larger and more severe in REM sleep (1795 voxels) compared to wakefulness (398 voxels), and extended to the middle cingulate cortex and the olfactory cortex. Hypoperfusion in the anterior cingulate cortex during REM sleep allowed better classification than hypoperfusion found in wakefulness (93.8 vs 81.3%). Conclusion: REM sleep imaging is a valuable tool with which to identify individuals at risk of developing AD. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Data sources Computerised searches of Medline, PubMed, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), PsycINFO, Scopus and Cochrane Library from 1 January 2000 to 31 December 2016 were done. There were 3222 articles identified. Study selection In addition to medical subject heading terms, a study was included if (1) published in English, (2) represented original research, (3) involved human research, (4) pertained to SRC and (5) involved data from neuroimaging, fluid biomarkers or genetic testing collected within 6 months of injury. Ninety-eight studies qualified for review (76 neuroimaging, 16 biomarkers and 6 genetic testing). Data extraction Separate reviews were conducted for neuroimaging, biomarkers and genetic testing. A standardised data extraction tool was used to document study design, population, tests employed and key findings. Reviewers used a modified quality assessment of studies of diagnostic accuracy studies (QUADAS-2) tool to rate the risk of bias, and a modified Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system to rate the overall level of evidence for each search. Data synthesis Results from the three respective reviews are compiled in separate tables and an interpretive summary of the findings is provided. Conclusions Advanced neuroimaging, fluid biomarkers and genetic testing are important research tools, but require further validation to determine their ultimate clinical utility in the evaluation of SRC. Future research efforts should address current gaps that limit clinical translation. Ultimately, research on neurobiological and genetic aspects of SRC is predicted to have major translational significance to evidence-based approaches to clinical management of SRC, much like applied clinical research has had over the past 20 years.

We tested the efficacy of losartan (10mg/kg/day for three months), a selective angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist, in alleviating cerebrovascular and cognitive deficits in double-transgenic mice (six months at endpoint) that overexpress a mutated form of the human amyloid precursor protein (APP(Swe,Ind)) and a constitutively active form of the transforming growth factor-1, thereafter named A/T mice. Losartan rescued cerebrovascular reactivity, particularly the dilatory responses, but failed to attenuate astroglial activation and to normalize the neurovascular uncoupling response to sensory stimulation. The cognitive deficits of A/T mice were not restored by losartan nor were the increased brain levels of soluble and insoluble A(1-40) and A(1-42) peptides normalized. Our results are the first to demonstrate the capacity of losartan to improve cerebrovascular reactivity in an Alzheimer's disease mouse model of combined A-induced vascular oxidative stress and transforming growth factor-1-mediated vascular fibrosis. These data suggest that losartan may be promising for restoring cerebrovascular function in patients with vascular diseases at risk for vascular dementia or Alzheimer's disease. However, a combined therapy may be warranted for rescuing both vascular and cognitive deficits in a multifaceted pathology like Alzheimer's disease.

Insulin also has been linked to brain functions such as feeding behavior and the imbalance of its mechanism of action on hippocampus is being related to cognitive dysfunction. The discussion here is whether changes in insulin action could contribute to intake dysregulation and obesogenic behavior as a primary consequence of impairing hippocampal functioning, aside from the role of this hormone on obesity development through peripheral metabolic pathways. Excess intake of high-fat and high-sugar diets leads to insulin resistance, which disrupts hippocampal function. Hippocampal physiology is sensitive to signals of hunger and satiety, inhibiting the ability of food cues to evoke appetite and eating, therefore alterations in hippocampal integrity could affect food inhibitory control leading to increased intake and obesity.

Sustained Activity Encoding Working Memories: Not Fully Distributed	TRENDS IN NEUROSCIENCES			English	Review							SHORT-TERM-MEMORY; PRIMATE PREFRONTAL CORTEX; INFERIOR TEMPORAL CORTEX; PRIMARY VISUAL-CORTEX; TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; POSTERIOR PARIETAL CORTEX; AUDITORY RECOGNITION MEMORY; LATERAL INTRAPARIETAL AREA; ANTERIOR CINGULATE SULCUS; SUPPLEMENTARY EYE FIELD	Working memory (WM) is the ability to remember and manipulate information for short time intervals. Recent studies have proposed that sustained firing encoding the contents of WM is ubiquitous across cortical neurons. We review here the collective evidence supporting this claim. A variety of studies report that neurons in prefrontal, parietal, and inferotemporal association cortices show robust sustained activity encoding the location and features of memoranda during WM tasks. However, reports of WM-related sustained activity in early sensory areas are rare, and typically lack stimulus specificity. We propose that robust sustained activity that can support WM coding arises as a property of association cortices downstream from the early stages of sensory processing.

Cognitive scientists often refer to surprises as "reward predictionerrors,"a parameter that captures discrepancies between expectations and actual outcomes. Here, we integrate neurophysiological and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) results addressing the processing of reward prediction errors and how they might be altered in drug addiction and Parkinson's disease. Recent Findings By increasing phasic dopamine responses, drugs might accentuate prediction error signals, causing increases in fMRI activity in mesolimbic areas in response to drugs. Chronic substance dependence, by contrast, has been linked with compromised dopaminergic function, which might be associated with blunted fMRI responses to pleasant non-Drug stimuli in mesocorticolimbic areas. In Parkinson's disease, dopamine replacement therapies seem to induce impairments in learning from negative outcomes. Summary The present review provides a holistic overview of reward prediction errors across different pathologies and might inform future clinical strategies targeting impulsive/compulsive disorders.

They have a complex etiology involving largely undetermined environmental and genetic factors. Previous studies in mouse models have implicated the transcription factor Grhl3 as an important factor in the pathogenesis of spina bifida. In the present study, we conducted a resequencing analysis of GRHL3 in a cohort of 233 familial and sporadic cases of spina bifida. We identified two novel truncating variants: one homozygous frameshift variant, p.Asp16Aspfs*10, in two affected siblings and one heterozygous intronic splicing variant, p.Ala318Glyfs*26. We also identified five missense variants, one of which was demonstrated to reduce the activation of gene targets in a luciferase reporter assay. With the previously identified p.Arg391Cys variant, eight variants were found in GRHL3. Comparison of the variant rate between our cohort and the ExAC database identified a significant enrichment of deleterious variants in GRHL3 in the whole gene and the transactivation region in spina bifida patients. These data provide strong evidence for a role of GRHL3 as a predisposing factor to spina bifida and will help dissect the complex etiology and pathogenic mechanisms of these malformations.

A promising solution to this problem is haptics, which could lead to new prostheses in which tactile information is conveyed between the amputee and the artificial limb. However, the haptic feedback must be optimized so that amputees can use it effectively; and although several studies have examined how specific haptic feedback systems can transmit certain types of tactile information, there has not yet been much research on the effects of superposing two or more types of feedback at the same location, which might prove to be more effective than using a single type of feedback alone. This paper investigates how the simultaneous application of two different types of haptic feedback-vibration and normal stress-impacts the human sensory perception of each separate feedback type. These stimuli were applied to glabrous skin on the forearms of 14 participants. Our experiments tested whether participants experienced more accurate sensory perception, compared to vibration or normal stress alone, when vibration was applied at the same time as the normal stress, at either the same location, or at a different location 6 cm away. Results indicate that although participants' perception of the normal stress diminished when vibration was applied at the same location, the same combination improved their perception of the vibration. Apparently, vibration has a negative impact upon the ability to perceive normal stress, whether applied at the same or a different location; whereas the opposite is true for the effect of normal stress upon the perception of vibration.

An exploratory study was performed utilizing Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation to investigate differences in corticospinal excitability in the Abductor Pollicis Brevis (APB) between 15 pain-free subjects and 15 subjects with chronic wrist/hand pain and to determine how corticospinal excitability was associated with measures of pain (visual analog scale, AUSCAN (TM)), hand motor performance (isometric and key pinch strength, Purdue Pegboard Test), disability (AUSCAN (TM)), and spinal motoneuronal excitability. Input-output curves demonstrated increased corticospinal excitability of the APB in the affected hand of subjects with chronic pain (p < 0.01). Changes in corticospinal excitability were significantly correlated with pain intensity (r = 0.77), disability (r = 0.58), and negatively correlated with motoneuronal excitability (r = -0.57). Corticospinal excitability in subjects with heterogeneous injuries of the wrist/hand was associated with disability and pain. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Methods: Caregivers completed a survey at 6 months and 1, 2, 3.5, and 5 years post-patient diagnosis, including the SF-12 for quality of life (QOL). SF-12 Mental Component Summary (MCS, n = 299) and Physical Component Summary (PCS, n = 300) scores were analyzed using SAS. Results: Five trajectories for PCS were identified, the top three were: (a) high PCS (53.0%); (b) steady decline in PCS (17.0%); and (c) steady increase, but remaining below population norm (16.7%). Five trajectories for MCS were also identified, the top two being: (a) high MCS (45.8%) and (b) MCS comparable to population norm (27.8%). Variables associated with low or deteriorating QOL included depression, social support, coping, burden, and/or unmet needs. Conclusions: This is the first study to document spouse caregivers' QOL over the first five years post-patient diagnosis. Although many participants experienced high functioning, almost a third reported low or deteriorating mental or physical functioning. Practice implications: Variables associated with low or deteriorating mental and physical functioning can be targeted in future interventions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

The Children's Oncology Group completed a Phase II study using oral etoposide given with radiotherapy followed by intensive chemotherapy. Procedure: Patients enrolled in the study had high-risk disease defined as >= 1.5 cm(2) of residual disease postsurgery or definite evidence of central nervous metastasis. All patients underwent surgery followed by radiotherapy. During radiation, the patients received oral etoposide (21 days on, 7 off) at an initial dose of 50 mg/m(2) per day (treatment 1), which was reduced to 35mg/m(2) per day (treatment 2) due to toxicity. After radiotherapy, the patients received chemotherapy with three cycles of cisplatin and oral etoposide, followed by eight courses of cyclophosphamide and vincristine. Results: Between November 1998 and October 2002, 53 patients were accrued; 15 received treatment 1 and 38 treatment 2. Forty-seven patients (89%) were eligible. Response to radiation was excellent, with 19 (40.4%) showing complete response, 24 (51.1%) partial response, and four (8.5%) no recorded response. The overall 2- and 5-year progression-free survival (PFS) was 76.6 +/- 6% and 70.2 +/- 7%, respectively. The 2- and 5-year overall survival (OS) was 80.9 +/- 6% and 76.6 +/- 6%, respectively. Clinical response postradiation and PFS/OS were not significantly different between the treatment groups. There was a trend toward a difference in 5-year PFS between those without and with metastatic disease (P = 0.072). Conclusions: Oral etoposide was tolerable at 35 mg/m(2) (21 days on and 7 days off) when given during full-dose irradiation in patients with high-risk medulloblastoma with encouraging survival data.

Most late adverse effects (LAEs) have been demonstrated to be time and treatment dependent. The PETALE study is a multidisciplinary research project aiming to comprehensively characterize LAEs and identify associated predictive biomarkers in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (cALL) survivors. Methods: cALL survivors treated at Sainte-Justine University Health Center with Dana-Farber Cancer Institution-ALL protocols 87-01 through 2005-01 were eligible. During Phase I of the study, the participants underwent comprehensive clinical, biologic, and psychosocial investigation targetingmetabolic syndrome, cardiotoxicity, bone morbidity, neurocognitive problems, and quality of life issues. Whole-exome sequencing was performed for all participants. Subjects identified with an extreme phenotype during Phase I were recalled for additional testing (Phase II). Results: Phase I included 246 survivors (recall rate 71.9%). Of those, 85 participants completed Phase II (recall rate 88.5%). Survivors agreeing to participate in Phase I (n = 251) were similar to those who refused (n = 31) in terms of relapse risk profile, radiotherapy exposure, and age at the time of study. Participants, however, tended to be slightly older at diagnosis (6.1 vs. 4.7 years old, P = 0.08), with a higher proportion of female agreeing to participate compared with males (93.2 vs. 86.5%, P = 0.07). Conclusion: The PETALE study will contribute to comprehensively characterize clinical, psychosocial, biologic, and genomic features of cALL survivors using an integrated approach. Expected outcomes include LAE early detection biomarkers, long-term follow-up guidelines, and recommendations for physicians and health professionals.

(1) What proportion of upper extremity implants using compressive osseointegration fixation principles achieved durable short-term fixation, and what were the modes of failure? (2) What surgical complications resulted from reconstruction using this technique? A multiinstitutional retrospective review identified nine patients (five women; four men) who underwent 13 endoprosthetic replacements between 2003 and 2014 using compressive osseointegration (Compliant(A (R)) Pre-stress Device [CPS]; Biomet Inc, Warsaw, IN, USA) in the upper extremity, including two proximal humeri, two humeral diaphyses, seven distal humeri, and two proximal ulna. During the early part of that period, the indication for use of a compressive prosthesis in our centers was revision of a previous tumor reconstruction (allograft-prosthetic composite or stemmed endoprosthetic reconstruction) (three patients; five implants), or revision arthroplasty with massive bone loss (three patients, four implants); more recently, indications became somewhat more permissive and included posttraumatic bone loss (one patient, one implant), primary bone sarcoma, and resections with very short remaining end segments after diaphyseal resections (two patients, three implants). Minimum followup was 24 months; one patient (one implant) was lost to followup before that time with the implant intact at 14 months and no patients have died. The mean age of the patients was 45 years (range, 21-62 years). Mean followup was 68 months (range, 24-141 months). Implant revision for any cause and for failure of the CPS mechanism was recorded. Modes of failure were categorized as soft tissue, aseptic loosening, structural, infection, and tumor progression; CPS modes of failure were defined as lack of fixation, with or without bone or implant fracture. Of the 12 implants accounted for beyond 2 years, six had undergone revision of any kind. Only two revisions in two patients were attributable to lack of CPS fixation at the bone-implant interface; one of the patients also had periprosthetic and implant fracture develop through the traction bar. Other modes of failure were aseptic loosening of the standard ulnar component (two patients, two implants), bushing wear (one patient; one implant) and infection resulting in two-stage exchange and free soft tissue transfer with retention of the CPS spindle (one patient, one implant). Complications for all nine patients included one transient radial nerve palsy, one ulnar nerve sensory neurapraxia, one superficial infection, and two glenohumeral subluxations, one underwent revision surgery with implantation of a constrained liner. A compressive osseointegration endoprosthesis is an option for very difficult revisions or sarcoma resection in the upper extremity in which the remaining segment of host bone is too short for a conventional prosthesis. However, surgeons must inform patients that these are salvage operations, and revision surgery is common. Long-term followup of more patients is necessary to further document the survivorship of these implants in the upper extremity. Level IV, therapeutic study.

Laboratory studies have largely focused on how the VMF contributes to decision-making when outcomes or options are provided, but in the real world generating appropriate options is likely a crucial and rate-limiting initial step. Here, we determined how VMF damage affected the option generation phase of naturalistic problem solving. A group of patients with VMF damage and two controls groupsage-matched healthy participants and patients with frontal damage sparing VMFwere asked to generate as many options as possible to five scenarios depicting open-ended, real-world problems (e.g., having lunch at a restaurant and forgetting your wallet at home). Both the number of options and the effectiveness of each option generated were examined. Damage to VMF led to a significant reduction in both the number of options produced across all problem-solving scenarios and the ability to generate effective options, most notably for scenarios that were social in nature. We discuss these findings in terms of the mechanisms by which the VMF may contribute to option generation, focusing on proposals suggesting this region is important for integrating subjective value and retrieving schematic representations.

We used magnetoencephalography to identify the brain regions involved and specify the time course of dynamic modulations of executive control processes during strategy execution. Participants performed a computational estimation task in which they were instructed to execute a poorer or better strategy to estimate results of two-digit multiplication problems. When participants were asked to execute the poorer strategy, two distinct sets of brain activations were identified, depending on whether the poorer strategy (engaging the left inferior frontal junction) or the better strategy (engaging ACC) had been executed on the immediately preceding items. Our findings also revealed the time course of activations in regions involved in sequential modulations of cognitive control processes during arithmetic strategy execution. These findings point at processes of proactive preparation on items after poorer strategy items and dynamics of reactive adjustments after better strategy items.

Inflammasomes are cytosolic protein complexes that mediate caspase-1 activation and ensuing cleavage and release of IL-1 beta and -18 by macrophages. Our group recently showed that HIV-1 infection of human microglia induced inflammasome activation in NLRP3-dependent manner. The HIV-1 viral protein R (Vpr) is an accessory protein that is released from HIV-infected cells, although its effects on neuroinflammation are undefined. Infection of human microglia with Vpr-deficient HIV-1 resulted in reduced caspase-1 activation and IL-1 beta production, compared to cells infected with a Vpr-encoding HIV-1 virus. Vpr was detected at low nanomolar concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid from HIV-infected patients and in supernatants from HIV-infected primary human microglia. Exposure of human macrophages to Vpr caused caspase-1 cleavage and IL-1 beta release with reduced cell viability, which was dependent on NLRP3 expression. Increased NLRP3, caspase-1, and IL-1 beta expression was evident in HIV-1 Vpr transgenic mice compared to wild-type littermates, following systemic immune stimulation. Treatment with the caspase-1 inhibitor, VX-765, suppressed NLRP3 expression with reduced IL-1 beta expression and associated neuroinflammation. Neurobehavioral deficits showed improvement in Vpr transgenic animals treated with VX-765. Thus, Vpr-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation, which contributed to neuroinflammation and was abrogated by caspase-1 inhibition. This study provides a new therapeutic perspective for HIV-associated neuropsychiatric disease.

However, this process involves intentional cognitive control, which does not correspond to the automatic emergence of stereotyped thoughts and behaviours usually reported by patients with OCD. In the present study, the excessive facilitation of unintentional processes was assessed in OCD by using the Computerized Mirror Pointing Task (CMPT). Seventy-six volunteers participated in this study, including 39 patients with OCD and 37 healthy controls. The CMPT was administered to all participants, and a score of appropriateness of the sensorimotor adaptation to the mirror inversion was computed from the initial deviation angle (IDA), that precedes the intentional readjustment of movement. Results showed that throughout the 40 trials of the CMPT, the IDA score remained significantly abnormal in patients with OCD in comparison with control participants. Further analyses of IDA scores in OCD revealed a clear tendency to keep a natural visuomotor processing that is rigid and unadapted to the mirror condition. Irrespective of the physical requirements of the environment, patients with OCD showed a strong tendency to initiate movements as per a previously consolidated - although unadapted- sensorimotor mapping. This suggests a tendency for an excessive facilitation of unintentional stereotyped processes. Further studies should be conducted on this question by using tasks sensitive to cognitive processes other than visuo-spatial abilities. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Feasibility of Random-Forest Approach for Prediction of Ground Settlements Induced by the Construction of a Shield-Driven Tunnel	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOMECHANICS			English	Article						Ground settlements; Shield tunneling; Random forests; Cross validation	MAXIMUM SURFACE SETTLEMENT; ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; ISTANBUL METRO; TWIN TUNNELS; SOFT SOILS; MOVEMENTS; SHALLOW; EPB; DEFORMATIONS; TBM	Ground settlements above a tunnel as a result of tunnel construction can be predicted with the help of input variables that have direct physical significance. Several empirical and artificial intelligence methods for estimating ground settlements have been established by researchers. However, these methods have some limitations because the large number of influential factors involved makes tunnel-ground interaction complicated. In this work, a random forest (RF) was developed and employed to predict ground settlements above tunnels. To achieve this goal, tunnel geometry, geological properties, and construction parameters were investigated as input variables to utilize in the RF modeling, resulting in the maximum surface settlement value (S-max) and trough width (i) as the ground surface settlement index. To demonstrate the applicability of the RF model, two data sets associated with different features, which were obtained from a detailed investigation of different tunnel projects published in literature, were utilized for model development and were applied to check the performance capacity of the developed model. A fivefold cross-validation procedure was then applied to identify the optimal parameter values during modeling, and an external testing set was employed to validate the prediction performance of the model. Two performance measures, R-2 and RMS error, were employed. The relative importance of different parameters in the prediction of ground settlements was also investigated. Findings demonstrate that the RF method provides promising results and offers an alternative means in predicting ground settlements induced by tunneling.

ADNI	Two distinct classes of degenerative change are independently linked to clinical progression in mild cognitive impairment	NEUROBIOLOGY OF AGING			English	Article						White matter; Mild cognitive impairment; Longitudinal cohort study; Cognitive decline; Alzheimer's disease; Small-vessel disease; CSF biomarkers	VASCULAR RISK-FACTORS; WHITE-MATTER LESIONS; SMALL VESSEL DISEASE; ALZHEIMER-DISEASE; AD DEMENTIA; CORTICAL SIGNATURE; APOLIPOPROTEIN-E; OLDEST-OLD; APOE; MRI	We previously demonstrated 2 statistically distinct factors of degeneration in Alzheimer's disease: one strongly related to white matter damage and age interpreted as"age-and vascular-related", and the other related to cortical atrophy thought to represent"neurodegenerative changes associated with Alzheimer's disease". Those factors are now replicated in a distinct cross-sectional data set of 364 participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative and their interpretation is improved using correlations with CSF biomarkers. Furthermore, we now show that changes in both factors over 2 years are independently associated with decline in MinieMental State Examination score in a longitudinal subset of 116 individuals with mild cognitive impairment. Progression in the"age-and vascularrelated" factor was greater for individuals with 2 APOE epsilon 4 alleles and linked to a greater attributable change in MinieMental State Examination than the"neurodegenerative" factor. These results suggest benefits of targeting white matter and vascular health to complement interventions focused on the neurodegenerative aspect of the disease, even in individuals with little discernable vascular comorbidity.

Whether these changes reflect cognitive heterogeneity or differences in disease severity is still unknown. This study aimed at investigating changes in neuroimaging biomarkers, according to the age of onset of the disease, in mild amnestic Alzheimer's disease patients with positive amyloid biomarkers in cerebrospinal fluid. Both patient groups were impaired on tasks assessing verbal and visual recognition memory. EOAD patients showed greater executive and linguistic deficits, while LOAD patients showed greater semantic memory impairment. In EOAD and LOAD, hypometabolism involved the bilateral temporoparietal junction and the posterior cingulate cortex. In EOAD, atrophy was widespread, including frontotemporoparietal areas, whereas it was limited to temporal regions in LOAD. Atrophic volumes were greater in EOAD than in LOAD. Hypometabolic volumes were similar in the 2 groups. Greater extent of atrophy in EOAD, despite similar extent of hypometabolism, could reflect different underlying pathophysiological processes, different glucose-based compensatory mechanisms or distinct level of premorbid atrophic lesions.

However, its exact mechanism of action is still under investigation. Tracking of fluorescently-tagged encephalitogenic T cells during experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model for multiple sclerosis, revealed that laquinimod significantly reduces the invasion of pathogenic effector T cells into the CNS tissue. T-cell activation, differentiation and amplification within secondary lymphoid organs after immunization with myelin antigen, their migratory capacity and re-activation within the nervous tissue were either only mildly affected or remained unchanged. Instead, laquinimod directly impacted the functionality of the CNS vasculature. The expression of tight junction proteins p120 and ZO-1 in human brain endothelial cells was up-regulated upon laquinimod treatment, resulting in a significant increase in the transendothelial electrical resistance of confluent monolayers of brain endothelial cells. Similarly, expression of the adhesion molecule activated leukocyte cell adhesion molecule (ALCAM) and inflammatory chemokines CCL2 and IP-10 was suppressed, leading to a significant reduction in the migration of memory T(H)1 and T(H)17 lymphocytes across the blood brain barrier (BBB). Our data indicate that laquinimod exerts its therapeutic effects by tightening the BBB and limiting parenchymal invasion of effector T cells, thereby reducing CNS damage. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Astrocyte heme oxygenase-1 reduces mortality and improves outcome after collagenase-induced intracerebral hemorrhage	NEUROBIOLOGY OF DISEASE			English	Article						Glia; Intracerebral hemorrhage; Nrf2; Stroke; Subarachnoid hemorrhage	MEDIATED OXIDATIVE INJURY; BRAIN-BARRIER DISRUPTION; ANTIOXIDANT DEFENSES; CULTURED NEURONS; CARBON-MONOXIDE; PROTECTS; MICE; NRF2; OVEREXPRESSION; TOXICITY	Pharmacotherapies that increase CNS expression of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and other antioxidant proteins have improved outcome in experimental models of spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). In order to more specifically investigate the relationship between HO-1 and ICH outcome, mice expressing human HO-1 driven by the glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) promoter (GFAP"HMOX1 mice) were tested in a model of in situ parenchymal hemorrhage. Injection of collagenase into the striata of wild-type (WT) mice resulted in a 26.3% mortality rate, with deaths equally distributed between males and females. Mortality was reduced to 4.48% in GFAP"HMOX1 mice. Cell viability in the injected striata of surviving WT mice was reduced by about half at one week and was significantly increased in transgenics; this benefit persisted over a 22 day observation period. Cell counts guided by design-based stereology indicated loss of similar to 40% of neurons in WT hemorrhagic striata at one week, which was decreased by half in transgenics; no significant differences in microglia or astrocyte numbers were observed. Blood-brain barrier disruption and short-term neurological deficits were also mitigated in GFAP" HMOX1 mice, but long-term outcome did not differ from that of WT survivors. These results suggest that astrocyte HO-1 overexpression provides robust neuroprotection after acute intracerebral hemorrhage. Further investigation of drug or genetic therapies that selectively increase astrocyte HO-1 is warranted. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Courtship song preferences in female zebra finches are shaped by developmental auditory experience	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						zebra finch; auditory processing; preference; EGR1; social context	CONTEXT-DEPENDENT CHANGES; CANARIES SERINUS-CANARIA; BASAL GANGLIA CIRCUIT; VOCAL PERFORMANCE; MATING PREFERENCES; MATE-CHOICE; BIRD SONG; VARIABILITY; SONGBIRDS; RESPONSES	The performance of courtship signals provides information about the behavioural state and quality of the signaller, and females can use such information for social decision-making (e.g. mate choice). However, relatively little is known about the degree to which the perception of and preference for differences in motor performance are shaped by developmental experiences. Furthermore, the neural substrates that development could act upon to influence the processing of performance features remains largely unknown. In songbirds, females use song to identify males and select mates. Moreover, female songbirds are often sensitive to variation in male song performance. Consequently, we investigated how developmental exposure to adult male song affected behavioural and neural responses to song in a small, gregarious songbird, the zebra finch. Zebra finch males modulate their song performance when courting females, and previous work has shown that females prefer the high-performance, female-directed courtship song. However, unlike females allowed to hear and interact with an adult male during development, females reared without developmental song exposure did not demonstrate behavioural preferences for high-performance courtship songs. Additionally, auditory responses to courtship and non-courtship song were altered in adult females raised without developmental song exposure. These data highlight the critical role of developmental auditory experience in shaping the perception and processing of song performance.

Twelve healthy non-obese men aged 24.8 +/- 1.7 years (mean +/- SE) completed a symptom-limited constant-load cycle endurance exercise test at 85% of their peak incremental power output with diaphragmatic electromyography (EMGdi) and respiratory pressure measurements under two randomly assigned conditions: unbound control (CTRL) and AB sufficient to increase end-expiratory gastric pressure (Pga, ee) by 5-8 cmH(2)O at rest. By design, AB increased Pga, ee by 6.6 +/- 0.6 cmH(2)O at rest. Compared to CTRL, AB significantly increased the trans diaphragmatic pressure swing-to-EMGdi ratio by 85-95% during exercise, reflecting enhanced neuromuscular efficiency of the diaphragm. By contrast, AB had no effect on spirometric parameters at rest, exercise endurance time or an effect on cardiac, metabolic, ventilatory, breathing pattern, dynamic operating lung volume, and perceptual responses during exercise. In conclusion, AB was associated with isolated and acute improvements in neuromuscular efficiency of the diaphragm during exercise in healthy men. The implications of our results are that AB may be an effective means of enhancing neuromuscular efficiency of the diaphragm in clinical populations with diaphragmatic weakness/dysfunction.

The mechanism depicting how ARBs such as losartan restore cerebrovascular and cognitive deficits in AD is unknown. Here, we propose a mechanism underlying losartan's benefits by selectively blocking the effects of angiotensin IV (AngIV) at its receptor (AT4R) with divalinal in mice overexpressing the AD-related Swedish and Indiana mutations of the human amyloid precursor protein (APP mice) and WT mice. Young (3-month-old) mice were treated with losartan (similar to 10 mg/kg/d, 4 months), followed by intracerebroventricular administration of vehicle or divalinal in the final month of treatment. Spatial learning and memory were assessed using Morris water mazes at 3 and 4 months of losartan treatment. Cerebrovascular reactivity and whisker-evoked neurovascular coupling responses were measured at end point (similar to 7 months of age), together with biomarkers related to neuronal and vascular oxidative stress (superoxide dismutase-2), neuroinflammation (astroglial and microglial activation), neurogenesis (BrdU-labeled newborn cells), and amyloidosis [soluble amyloid-beta(A beta) species and A beta plaque load]. Divalinal countered losartan's capacity to rescue spatial learning and memory and blocked losartan's benefits on dilatory function and baseline nitric oxide bioavailability. Divalinal reverted losartan's anti-inflammatory effects, but failed to modify losartan-mediated reductions in oxidative stress. Neither losartan nor divalinal affected arterial blood pressure or significantly altered the amyloid pathology in APP mice. Our findings identify activation of the AngIV/AT4R cascade as the underlying mechanism in losartan's benefits and a target that could restore A beta-related cognitive and cerebrovascular deficits in AD.

Identification of function-regulating antibodies targeting the receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase sigma ectodomain	PLOS ONE			English	Article							SPINAL-CORD-INJURY; INHIBITORY WEDGE; STRUCTURAL BASIS; PTP-SIGMA; DIMERIZATION; PROTEOGLYCAN; REGENERATION; EXTENSION; ALPHA	Receptor tyrosine phosphatase sigma (RPTP sigma) plays an important role in the regulation of axonal outgrowth and neural regeneration. Recent studies have identified two RPTP sigma ligands, chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) and heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG), which can modulate RPTP sigma activity by affecting its dimerization status. Here, we developed a split luciferase assay to monitor RPTP sigma dimerization in living cells. Using this system, we demonstrate that heparin, an analog of heparan sulfate, induced the dimerization of RPTP sigma , whereas chondroitin sulfate increased RPTP sigma activity by inhibiting RPTP sigma dimerization. Also, we generated several novel RPTP sigma vertical bar gG monoclonal antibodies, to identify one that modulates its activity by inducing/stabilizing dimerization in living cells. Lastly, we demonstrate that this antibody promotes neurite outgrowth in SH-SY5Y cells. In summary, we demonstrated that the split luciferase RPTP sigma activity assay is a novel high throughput approach for discovering novel RPTP sigma modulators that can promote axonal outgrowth and neural regeneration.

Circadian disturbances are among the earliest symptoms of these diseases, and the molecular mechanisms of the circadian system are suspected to play a pivotal, and possibly causal, role in their natural histories. Here, we review the common circadian abnormalities observed in ADs, PDs and HDs, and summarize the evidence that the molecular circadian clockwork directly influences the course of these disease states. On the basis of this research, we explore several circadian-oriented interventions proposed as treatments for these neurological disorders.

Here, we mapped expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) in a collection of human DRGs. DRG eQTLs were enriched within untranslated regions of coding genes of low abundance, with some overlapping with other brain regions and blood cell cis-eQTLs. We confirm functionality of identified eQTLs through their significant enrichment within open chromatin and highly deleterious SNPs, particularly at the exon level, suggesting substantial contribution of eQTLs to alternative splicing regulation. We illustrate pain-related genetic association results explained by DRGeQTLs, with the strongest evidence for contribution of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) locus, confirmed using a mouse inflammatory pain model. Finally, we show that DRG eQTLs are found among hits in numerous genome-wide association studies, suggesting that this dataset will help address pain components of non-pain disorders.

Strikingly, despite its potential importance for our understanding of addictive behaviors, the impact of drug rewards on memory systems dynamics has not been extensively studied. Here, we assessed long-term effects of drug-vs food reinforcement on the subsequent use of S-R vs spatial learning strategies and their neural substrates. Mice were trained in a Y-maze cue-guided task, during which either food or morphine injections into the ventral tegmental area (VTA) were used as rewards. Although drug-and food-reinforced mice learned the Y-maze task equally well, drug-reinforced mice exhibited a preferential use of an S-R learning strategy when tested in a water-maze competition task designed to dissociate cue-based and spatial learning. This cognitive bias was associated with a persistent increase in the phosphorylated form of cAMP response element-binding protein phosphorylation (pCREB) within the DS, and a decrease of pCREB expression in the HPC. Pharmacological inhibition of striatal PKA pathway in drug-rewarded mice limited the morphine-induced increase in levels of pCREB in DS and restored a balanced use of spatial vs cue-based learning. Our findings suggest that drug (opiate) reward biases the engagement of separate memory systems toward a predominant use of the cue-dependent system via an increase in learning-related striatal pCREB activity. Persistent functional imbalance between striatal and hippocampal activity could contribute to the persistence of addictive behaviors, or counteract the efficiency of pharmacological or psychotherapeutic treatments.

Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) responsive element-binding protein (CREB) is a transcription factor that regulates the expression of many genes. We found that lactating rats that are more maternal towards their pups showing increased licking/grooming (i.e. high-LG mothers) had increased levels of phosphorylated CREB (pCREB) in the MPOA following a nursing bout and they displayed a reduced population of greater dendritic complexity index (DCI) neurons compared to less maternal rats showing decreased licking/grooming (i.e. low-LG mothers). CREB overexpression in MPOA neuronal cultures associated with a decrease in dendritic complexity and an increase in the expression of Rem2 and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), genes implicated in dendritic pruning. While there were no differences in Rem2 expression in virgin high and low-LG female rats, Rem2 was significantly increased in the MPOA of high-LG compared to low-LG lactating rats. CREB activity in the MPOA associates with maternal behavior and reduced dendritic complexity possibly by increasing Rem2 expression. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The majority can track the beat of music and move along with it. These abilities are meaningful from a cognitive standpoint given their tight links with prominent motor and cognitive functions such as language and memory. When rhythmic skills are challenged by brain damage or neurodevelopmental disorders, remediation strategies based on rhythm can be considered. For example, rhythmic training can be used to improve motor performance (e.g., gait) as well as cognitive and language skills. Here, we review the games readily available in the market and assess whether they are well-suited for rhythmic training. Games that train rhythm skills may serve as useful tools for retraining motor and cognitive functions in patients with motor or neurodevelopmental disorders (e.g., Parkinson's disease, dyslexia, or ADHD). Our criteria were the peripheral used to capture and record the response, the type of response and the output measure. None of the existing games provides sufficient temporal precision in stimulus presentation and/or data acquisition. In addition, games do not train selectively rhythmic skills. Hence, the available music games, in their present form, are not satisfying for training rhythmic skills. Yet, some features such as the device used, the interface or the game scenario provide good indications for devising efficient training protocols. Guidelines are provided for devising serious music games targeting rhythmic training in the future.

Neuronal hyperexcitability was shown to significantly increase Tau release by neurons. We confirmed this in the present study. In a previous study, it was demonstrated that hyperexcitability induces Golgi apparatus dynamics resulting in its fragmentation. Our present results revealed that the increase of Tau secretion upon hyperexcitability could be significantly reduced by preventing Golgi dynamics through the inactivation of cdk5. We then verified whether a Golgi fragmentation not induced by hyperexcitability could also increase Tau secretion. The suppression of Rab1A, Rab GTPase associated with the Golgi membranes, known to induce a Golgi fragmentation increased Tau secretion by both neurons and HeLa cells. Although it remains to be demonstrated whether the Golgi is directly involved in Tau secretion, the present results demonstrate that its dynamics are correlated to a modulation of Tau secretion.

Although several of these domains are sex biased, our fundamental understanding of cerebellar sex differences-including their spatial distribution, potential biological determinants, and independence from brain volume variation-lags far behind that for the cerebrum. Here, we harness automated neuroimaging methods for cerebellar morphometrics in 417 individuals to (1) localize normative male-female differences in raw cerebellar volume, (2) compare these to sex chromosome effects estimated across five rare sex (X/Y) chromosome aneuploidy (SCA) syndromes, and (3) clarify brain size-independent effects of sex and SCA on cerebellar anatomy using a generalizable allometric approach that considers scaling relationships between regional cerebellar volume and brain volume in health. The integration of these approaches shows that (1) sex and SCA effects on raw cerebellar volume are large and distributed, but regionally heterogeneous, (2) human cerebellar volume scales with brain volume in a highly nonlinear and regionally heterogeneous fashion that departs from documented patterns of cerebellar scaling in phylogeny, and (3) cerebellar organization is modified in a brain size-independent manner by sex (relative expansion of total cerebellum, flocculus, and Crus II-lobule VIIIB volumes in males) and SCA (contraction of total cerebellar, lobule IV, and Crus I volumes with additional X- or Y-chromosomes; X-specific contraction of Crus II-lobule VIIIB). Our methods and results clarify the shifts in human cerebellar organization that accompany interwoven variations in sex, sex chromosome complement, and brain size.	[Mankiw, Catherine; Reardon, P.

Concussion induces focal and widespread neuromorphological changes	NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS			English	Article						Concussion; MRI; Cortical thickness; Cortical volume; Cerebellum	TRAUMATIC BRAIN-INJURY; AUTOMATICALLY GENERATED TEMPLATES; DIFFUSE AXONAL INJURY; MRI DATA; MILD; SEGMENTATION; CONNECTIVITY; HIPPOCAMPUS; CORTEX; TASK	Concussion induces transient, and oftentimes chronic, lingering impairment to mental functioning, which must be driven by some underlying neurobiological perturbation - however, the physical changes related to sequelae are difficult to detect. Previous imaging studies on concussion have focused on alterations to cortical anatomy, but few have examined the cerebrum, subcortex, and cerebellum. Here, we present an analysis of these structures in a single cohort (all males, 21 patients, 22 controls) using MRI and diagnosed with a single-concussive episode in the acute and sub-acute stages of injury. Structural images were segmented into 78 cortical brain regions and 81,924 vertices using the CIVET algorithm. Sub cortical volumetric analyses of the cerebellum, thalamus, globus pallidus, caudate and putamen were conducted following segmentation. Participants with concussion were found to have reduced white and grey matter volume, total cortical volume, as well as cortical thinning, primarily in left frontal areas. No differences were observed in the cerebellum or subcortical structures. In conclusion, just a single concussive episode induces measurable changes in brain structure manifesting as diffuse and local patterns of altered neuromorphometry.

Meta-analysis of GWAS of over 16,000 individuals with autism spectrum disorder highlights a novel locus at 10q24.32 and a significant overlap with schizophrenia	MOLECULAR AUTISM			English	Article						Autism spectrum disorder; Genome-wide association study; Meta-analysis; Genetic correlation; Heritability; Gene-set analysis; Schizophrenia; Neurodevelopment	GENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION; PERVASIVE DEVELOPMENTAL DISORDERS; GENETIC RESOURCE EXCHANGE; COPY NUMBER VARIATION; DE-NOVO MUTATIONS; RISK LOCI; INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY; NEURONAL MIGRATION; MENTAL-RETARDATION; ASPERGER-SYNDROME	Background: Over the past decade genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been applied to aid in the understanding of the biology of traits. The success of this approach is governed by the underlying effect sizes carried by the true risk variants and the corresponding statistical power to observe such effects given the study design and sample size under investigation. Previous ASD GWAS have identified genome-wide significant (GWS) risk loci; however, these studies were of only of low statistical power to identify GWS loci at the lower effect sizes (odds ratio (OR) < 1.15). Methods: We conducted a large-scale coordinated international collaboration to combine independent genotyping data to improve the statistical power and aid in robust discovery of GWS loci. This study uses genome-wide genotyping data from a discovery sample (7387 ASD cases and 8567 controls) followed by meta-analysis of summary statistics from two replication sets (7783 ASD cases and 11359 controls; and 1369 ASD cases and 137308 controls). Results: We observe a GWS locus at 10q24.32 that overlaps several genes including PITX3, which encodes a transcription factor identified as playing a role in neuronal differentiation and CUEDC2 previously reported to be associated with social skills in an independent population cohort. We also observe overlap with regions previously implicated in schizophrenia which was further supported by a strong genetic correlation between these disorders (Rg = 0.23; P= 9 x10(-6)). We further combined these Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC) ASD GWAS data with the recent PGC schizophrenia GWAS to identify additional regions which may be important in a common neurodevelopmental phenotype and identified 12 novel GWS loci. These include loci previously implicated in ASD such as FOXP1 at 3p13, ATP2B2 at 3p25.3, and a 'neurodevelopmental hub' on chromosome 8p11.23. Conclusions: This study is an important step in the ongoing endeavour to identify the loci which underpin the common variant signal in ASD. In addition to novel GWS loci, we have identified a significant genetic correlation with schizophrenia and association of ASD with several neurodevelopmental- related genes such as EXT1, ASTN2, MACROD2, and HDAC4.

They have high comorbidity rates and have both been associated with motor difficulties. Little is known, however, about what is shared or differentiated in dyslexia and AD in terms of motor abilities. Even when motor skill problems are identified, few studies have used the same measurement tools, resulting in inconstant findings. The present study assessed increasingly complex gross motor skills in children and adolescents with dyslexia, AD, and with both Dyslexia and AD. Our results suggest normal performance on simple motor-speed tests, whereas all three groups share a common impairment on unimanual and bimanual sequential motor tasks. Children in these groups generally improve with practice to the same level as normal subjects, though they make more errors. In addition, children with AD are the most impaired on complex bimanual out-of-phase movements and with manual dexterity. These latter findings are examined in light of the Multiple Deficit Model.

Previous studies indicate that auditory perception depends on pre-target neural activity. However, so far the pre-target electrophysiological conditions which enable the detection of small pitch changes are not well studied, but might yield important insights into pitch-processing. We used magnetoen-cephalography (MEG) source imaging to reveal the pre-target effects of successful auditory detection of small pitch deviations from a sequence of standard tones. Participants heard a sequence of four pure tones and had to determine whether the last target tone was different or identical to the first three standard sounds. We found that successful pitch change detection could be predicted from the amplitude of theta (4-8 Hz) oscillatory activity in the right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) as well as beta (12-30 Hz) oscillatory activity in the right auditory cortex. These findings confirm and extend evidence for the involvement of theta as well as beta-band activity in auditory perception.

J	Racine, E				Racine, Eric			A Proposal for a Scientifically-Informed and Instrumentalist Account of Free Will and Voluntary Action	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						free will; voluntary action; autonomy; ethics; pragmatism; neuroscience	CONSCIOUS INTENTION; WEAKENING BELIEF; PREMOTOR CORTEX; BRAIN; RESPONSIBILITY; INTUITIONS; DETERMINISM; INHIBITION; PHILOSOPHY; PSYCHOLOGY	The ability to choose freely is captured under the umbrella concept of "free will," which designates an ability that plays a crucial role in most understandings of autonomy and responsibility and, thus, bears significance for moral practice and moral theory. Some claim that neuroscience research challenges the existence of free will/voluntary action while some who adopt stronger eliminativist stances have gone as far as describing free will as an illusion. Contrary to that, those relying on realist stances have restated the foundational value and role of folk psychological concepts of voluntary action and free will in, for example, the domains of ethics and law. An emerging body of research in cognitive science and social psychology has generated results suggesting that the phenomena captured by the concepts describing free will and voluntary action are dynamic and responsive to priming and framing effects. We propose that this body of research suggests the existence of dynamic and consequential properties of free will better captured following pragmatist theory and instrumentalist epistemology. This contrasts the simpler static concept of free will and the related metaphysics that was at the basis of earlier debates and structured around the poles of realism and eliminativism. This paper contextualizes ontological and epistemological debates about free will, describes a scientifically-informed and instrumentalist account of the concept of free will and voluntary action consistent with recent research in cognitive science, and discusses its implications for research (e.g., theoretical assumptions of research paradigms, interdisciplinary research) and practice (e.g., impact on self-image and social behavior).

Netrin1 Produced by Neural Progenitors, Not Floor Plate Cells, Is Required for Axon Guidance in the Spinal Cord	NEURON			English	Article							NERVOUS-SYSTEM; COMMISSURAL AXONS; PROTEIN; DROSOPHILA; GRADIENT; GROWTH; GENE; DCC; PROJECTIONS; EXPRESSION	Netrin1 has been proposed to act from the floor plate (FP) as a long-range diffusible chemoattractant for commissural axons in the embryonic spinal cord. However, netrin1 mRNA and protein are also present in neural progenitors within the ventricular zone (VZ), raising the question of which source of netrin1 promotes ventrally directed axon growth. Here, we use genetic approaches in mice to selectively remove netrin from different regions of the spinal cord. Our analyses show that the FP is not the source of netrin1 directing axons to the ventral midline, while local VZ-supplied netrin1 is required for this step. Further-more, rather than being present in a gradient, netrin1 protein accumulates on the pial surface adjacent to the path of commissural axon extension. Thus, netrin1 does not act as a long-range secreted chemoattractant for commissural spinal axons but instead promotes ventrally directed axon outgrowth by haptotaxis, i. e., directed growth along an adhesive surface.

The commonly used singular perturbation theory (SPT) to solve this problem is based on the accurately reduced system model, which is extremely difficult to be obtained in practical application. To overcome this difficulty, an adaptive dynamic programing-based optimal control algorithm with the simplified actor-critic-identifier structure is developed. A different time scales dynamic neural network (DTSDNN) identifier with a novel updating law derived from a properly designed LyapunoV function is proposed to estimate the unknown system dynamics. Furthermore, the critic NN with an improved adaptive law considering the NN weight estimation error information is designed, which can achieve faster convergent speed compared with the commonly Used gradient method. Lyapunov approach is used to guarantee exponential convergence to a bounded region in the neighborhood of the optimal control and uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB) stability of the closed-loop system. Two examples are provided to illustrate the effectiveness and applicability of the developed approach. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A subpopulation of GABAergic basket cells co-expresses the GABA/glycine vesicular transporters (VIAAT) and the atypical type III vesicular glutamate transporter (VGLUT3); therefore, these cells have the ability to signal with both GABA and glutamate. GABAergic transmission by basket cells has been extensively characterized but nothing is known about the functional implications of VGLUT3-dependent glutamate released by these cells. Here, using VGLUT3-null mice we observed that the loss of VGLUT3 results in a metaplastic shift in synaptic plasticity at Shaeffer'scollaterals-CA1 synapses and an altered theta oscillation. These changes were paralleled by the loss of a VGLUT3-dependent inhibition of GABAergic current in CA1 pyramidal layer. Therefore presynaptic type III metabotropic could be activated by glutamate released from VGLUT3-positive interneurons. This putative presynaptic heterologous feedback mechanism inhibits local GABAergic tone and regulates the hippocampal neuronal network.

Optimal method for assessment of respiratory muscle strength in neuromuscular disorders using sniff nasal inspiratory pressure (SNIP)	PLOS ONE			English	Article							AMYOTROPHIC-LATERAL-SCLEROSIS; DISEASE; MANEUVERS; VALUES; ADULTS; VALVE	Background The ability to accurately determine respiratory muscle strength is vitally important in patients with neuromuscular disorders (NMD). Sniff nasal inspiratory pressure (SNIP), a test of inspiratory muscle strength, is easier to perform for many NMD patients than the more commonly used determination of maximum inspiratory pressure measured at the mouth (MIP). However, due to an inconsistent approach in the literature, the optimal technique to perform the SNIP maneuver is unclear. Therefore, we systematically evaluated the impact of performing the maneuver with nostril contralateral to the pressure-sensing probe open (SNIPOP) versus closed (SNIPCL), on determination of inspiratory muscle strength in NMD patients as well as control subjects with normal respiratory muscle function. Methods NMD patients (n = 52) and control subjects without respiratory dysfunction (n = 52) were studied. SNIPOP, SNIPCL, and MIP were measured during the same session and compared using ANOVA. Agreement and bias were assessed with intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) and Bland-Altman plots. Results Mean MIP values were 58.2 and 94.0 cmH2O in NMD and control subjects, respectively (p<0.001). SNIPCL was greater than SNIPOP in NMD (51.9 +/- 31.0 vs. 36.9 +/- 25.4 cmH(2)O; p<0.001) as well as in controls (89.2 +/- 28.1 vs. 69.2 +/- 29.2 cmH(2)O; p<0.001). In both populations, the ICC between MIP and SNIPCL (NMD = 0.78, controls = 0.35) was higher than for MIP and SNIPOP (NMD = 0.53, controls = 0.06). In addition, SNIPCL was more often able to exclude inspiratory muscle weakness than SNIPOP. Conclusions SNIPCL values are systematically higher than SNIPOP in both normal subjects and NMD patients. Therefore, SNIPCL is a useful complementary test for ruling out inspiratory muscle weakness in individuals with low MIP values.

In the Drosophila olfactory system, the dendrites of projection neurons (PNs) stereotypically target one of similar to 50 glomeruli in the antennal lobe (AL), the primary olfactory center in the brain, and form synapses with the axons of olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs). Here, we show that Eph and Ephrin, the well-known axon guidance molecules, instruct the dendrodendritic segregation during the discrete olfactory map formation. The Eph receptor tyrosine kinase is highly expressed and localized in the glomeruli related to reproductive behavior in the developing AL. In one of the pheromone-sensing glomeruli (DA1), the Eph cell-autonomously regulates its dendrites to reside in a single glomerulus by interacting with Ephrins expressed in adjacent PN dendrites. Our data demonstrate that the trans interaction between dendritic Eph and Ephrin is essential for the PN dendritic boundary formation in the DA1 olfactory circuit, potentially enabling strict segregation of odor detection between pheromones and the other odors.

Alzheimer's Dis Neuroimaging Initi	Multifactorial causal model of brain (dis)organization and therapeutic intervention: Application to Alzheimer's disease	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Multifactorial causal model; Multimodal direct interactions; Intra-brain pathological spreading; Triggering pathological event; Control theory of networks; Computational therapeutic design; Alzheimer's disease; Neurodegeneration	RESTING-STATE FMRI; NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASES; HYPOTHETICAL MODEL; DYNAMIC BIOMARKERS; COMPLEX NETWORKS; HUMAN CONNECTOME; MOUSE MODEL; CONNECTIVITY; MRI; PROGRESSION	Generative models focused on multifactorial causal mechanisms in brain disorders are scarce and generally based on limited data. Despite the biological importance of the multiple interacting processes, their effects remain poorly characterized from an integrative analytic perspective. Here, we propose a spatiotemporal multifactorial causal model (MCM) of brain (dis)organization and therapeutic intervention that accounts for local causal interactions, effects propagation via physical brain networks, cognitive alterations, and identification of optimum therapeutic interventions. In this article, we focus on describing the model and applying it at the population-based level for studying late onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD). By interrelating six different neuroimaging modalities and cognitive measurements, this model accurately predicts spatiotemporal alterations in brain amyloid-beta (A beta) burden, glucose metabolism, vascular flow, resting state functional activity, structural properties, and cognitive integrity. The results suggest that a vascular dysregulation may be the most likely initial pathologic event leading to LOAD. Nevertheless, they also suggest that LOAD it is not caused by a unique dominant biological factor (e.g. vascular or A beta) but by the complex interplay among multiple relevant direct interactions. Furthermore, using theoretical control analysis of the identified population-based multi factorial causal network, we show the crucial advantage of using combinatorial over single-target treatments, explain why one-target A beta based therapies might fail to improve clinical outcomes, and propose an efficiency ranking of possible LOAD interventions. Although still requiring further validation at the individual level, this work presents the first analytic framework for dynamic multifactorial brain (dis)organization that may explain both the pathologic evolution of progressive neurological disorders and operationalize the influence of multiple interventional strategies.

In 136 healthy individuals, we investigated whether these differences reflect variation in the strength of connections between functionally-specialised segments of the hippocampus and diverse cortical regions that participate in different aspects of memory. Better topographical memory was associated with stronger connectivity between lingual gyrus and left anterior, rather than posterior, hippocampus. Better semantic memory was associated with increased connectivity between the intracalcarine/cuneus and left, rather than right, posterior hippocampus. Notably, we observed a double dissociation between semantic and topographical memory: better semantic memory was associated with stronger connectivity between left temporoparietal cortex and left anterior hippocampus, while better topographic memory was linked to stronger connectivity with right anterior hippocampus. Together these data support a division-of-labour account of hippocampal functioning: at the population level, differences in connectivity across the hippocampus reflect functional specialisation for different facets of memory, while variation in these connectivity patterns across individuals is associated with differences in the capacity to retrieve different types of information. In particular, within-hemisphere connectivity between hippocampus and left temporoparietal cortex supports conceptual processing at the expense of spatial ability.

However, its clinical utility has been limited in part by the lack of consistent information on how metabolite concentrations vary in the normal aging brain and in carriers of apolipoprotein E (APOE) epsilon 4, an established risk gene for AD. We quantified metabolites within an 8 cm(3) voxel within the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC)/precuneus in 30 younger (20-40 years) and 151 cognitively healthy older individuals (60-85 years). All H-1-MRS scans were performed at 3 T using the short-echo SPECIAL sequence and analyzed with LCModel. The effect of APOE was assessed in a sub-set of 130 volunteers. Older participants had significantly higher myo-inositol and creatine, and significantly lower glutathione and glutamate than younger participants. There was no significant effect of APOE or an interaction between APOE and age on the metabolite profile. Our data suggest that creatine, a commonly used reference metabolite in H-1-MRS studies, does not remain stable across adulthood within this region and therefore may not be a suitable reference in studies involving a broad age-range. Increases in creatine and myo-inositol may reflect age-related glial proliferation; decreases in glutamate and glutathione suggest a decline in synaptic and antioxidant efficiency. Our findings inform longitudinal clinical studies by characterizing age-related metabolite changes in a non-clinical sample.

MAVAN Res Teaall	Dynamic interaction between fetal adversity and a genetic score reflecting dopamine function on developmental outcomes at 36 months	PLOS ONE			English	Article							LOW-BIRTH-WEIGHT; INTRAUTERINE GROWTH RESTRICTION; RECEPTOR GENE; RISK-FACTORS; CHILDREN; AGE; NEURODEVELOPMENT; DISORDERS; ASSOCIATION; DEPRESSION	Background Fetal adversity, evidenced by poor fetal growth for instance, is associated with increased risk for several diseases later in life. Classical cut-offs to characterize small (SGA) and large for gestational age (LGA) newborns are used to define long term vulnerability. We aimed at exploring the possible dynamism of different birth weight cut-offs in defining vulnerability in developmental outcomes (through the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development), using the example of a gene vs. fetal adversity interaction considering gene choices based on functional relevance to the studied outcome. Methods 36-month-old children from an established prospective birth cohort (Maternal Adversity, Vulnerability, and Neurodevelopment) were classified according to birth weight ratio (BWR) (SGA <= 0.85, LGA > 1.15, exploring a wide range of other cut-offs) and genotyped for polymorphisms associated with dopamine signaling (TaqIA-A1 allele, DRD2-141C Ins/Ins, DRD4 7-repeat, DAT1-10-repeat, Met/Met-COMT), composing a score based on the described function, in which hypofunctional variants received lower scores. Results There were 251 children (123 girls and 128 boys). Using the classic cut-offs (0.85 and 1.15), there were no statistically significant interactions between the neonatal groups and the dopamine genetic score. However, when changing the cut-offs, it is possible to see ranges of BWR that could be associated with vulnerability to poorer development according to the variation in the dopamine function. Conclusion The classic birth weight cut-offs to define SGA and LGA newborns should be seen with caution, as depending on the outcome in question, the protocols for long-term follow up could be either too inclusive-therefore most costly, or unable to screen true vulnerabilities-and therefore ineffective to establish early interventions and primary prevention.

The effect of angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor, sacubitril/valsartan, on central nervous system amyloid-beta concentrations and clearance in the cynomolgus monkey	TOXICOLOGY AND APPLIED PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Alzheimer's disease; Amyloid beta; SILK-A beta; Angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor; Sacubitril/valsartan; LCZ696	ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; HEART-FAILURE; CEREBROSPINAL-FLUID; CHOROID-PLEXUS; RAT-BRAIN; DEPOSITION; LCZ696; ENDOPEPTIDASE-24.11; IDENTIFICATION; ENKEPHALINASE	Sacubitril/valsartan (LCZ696) is the first angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor approved to reduce cardiovascular mortality and hospitalization in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. As neprilysin (NEP) is one of several enzymes known to degrade amyloid-beta (A beta), there is a theoretical risk of A beta accumulation following long-term NEP inhibition. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the potential effects of sacubitril/valsartan on central nervous system clearance of AS isoforms in cynomolgus monkeys using the sensitive Stable Isotope Labeling Kinetics (SILK (TM))-A beta methodology. The in vitro selectivity of valsartan, sacubitril, and its active metabolite sacubitrilat was established; sacubitrilat did not inhibit other human A beta-degrading metalloproteases. In a 2-week study, sacubitril/valsartan (50 mg/kg/day) or vehicle was orally administered to female cynomolgus monkeys in conjunction with SILK (TM)-A beta. Despite low cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and brain penetration, CSF exposure to sacubitril was sufficient to inhibit NEP and resulted in an increase in the elimination half-life of A beta 1-42 (653%; p = 0.026), A beta 1-40 (35.2%; p = 0.04) and A beta total (29.8%; p = 0.04) acutely; this returned to normal as expected with repeated dosing for 15 days. CSF concentrations of newly generated A beta (AUC((0-24 h))) indicated elevations in the more aggregable form A beta 1-42 on day 1 (20.4%; p = 0.039) and day 15 (34.7%; p = 0.0003) and in shorter forms A beta 1-40 (23.4%; p = 0.009), A beta 1-38 (64.1%; p = 0.0001) and A beta total (50.45%; p = 0.00002) on day 15. However, there were no elevations in any A beta isoforms in the brains of these monkeys on day 16. In a second study cynomolgus monkeys were administered sacubitril/valsartan (300 mg/1<g) or vehicle control for 39 weeks; no microscopic brain changes or A beta deposition, as assessed by immunohistochemical staining, were present. Further clinical studies are planned to address the relevance of these findings. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

The effect of crack cocaine addiction and age on the microstructure and morphology of the human striatum and thalamus using shape analysis and fast diffusion kurtosis imaging	TRANSLATIONAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Article							DEPENDENT INDIVIDUALS; RECEPTOR AVAILABILITY; BRAIN STRUCTURE; MRI; VOLUME; GRAY; EXPOSURE; ABNORMALITIES; AMPHETAMINE; IMPULSIVITY	The striatum and thalamus are subcortical structures intimately involved in addiction. The morphology and microstructure of these have been studied in murine models of cocaine addiction (CA), showing an effect of drug use, but also chronological age in morphology. Human studies using non-invasive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have shown inconsistencies in volume changes, and have also shown an age effect. In this exploratory study, we used MRI-based volumetric and novel shape analysis, as well as a novel fast diffusion kurtosis imaging sequence to study the morphology and microstructure of striatum and thalamus in crack CA compared to matched healthy controls (HCs), while investigating the effect of age and years of cocaine consumption. We did not find significant differences in volume and mean kurtosis (MKT) between groups. However, we found significant contraction of nucleus accumbens in CA compared to HCs. We also found significant age-related changes in volume and MKT of CA in striatum and thalamus that are different to those seen in normal aging. Interestingly, we found different effects and contributions of age and years of consumption in volume, displacement and MKT changes, suggesting that each measure provides different but complementing information about morphological brain changes, and that not all changes are related to the toxicity or the addiction to the drug. Our findings suggest that the use of finer methods and sequences provides complementing information about morphological and microstructural changes in CA, and that brain alterations in CA are related cocaine use and age differently.

Gene-body 5-hydroxymethylation is associated with gene expression changes in the prefrontal cortex of depressed individuals	TRANSLATIONAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Article							SINGLE-BASE RESOLUTION; INSULIN-DEGRADING ENZYME; EMBRYONIC STEM-CELLS; DNA METHYLATION; MAJOR DEPRESSION; HUMAN BRAIN; BIPOLAR DISORDER; GENOME; 5-METHYLCYTOSINE; HYDROXYMETHYLATION	5-Hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) is a recently characterized epigenetic mark that is particularly abundant in brain tissue and that regulates gene transcription. We have recently begun to understand the important role of 5hmC in brain development, plasticity and disease, but there are currently little data on 5hmC alterations in psychiatric illnesses. Here we report what we believe to be the first genome-wide analysis of 5hmC in the depressed brain. Using AbaSI sequencing, we investigated 5hmC in the prefrontal cortex of depressed (N = 19) and psychiatrically healthy controls (N = 19). Consistent with previous global 5hmC analyses in other phenotypes, and likely owing to the inter-individual variability in 5hmC content, the distribution of 5hmC across chromosomes and genomic features was not different between groups. We did, however, find 550 CpGs with suggestive evidence of differential hydroxymethylation. Of these, we validated CpGs in the gene body of myosin XVI (MYO16) and insulin-degrading enzyme using targeted oxidative bisulfite sequencing. Furthermore, the enrichment of 5hmC was also associated with changes in the expression of these two genes in depressed suicides. Together, our results present a novel mechanism linking increased 5hmC to depression and provide a framework for future research in this field.	[Gross, J. A.; Chen, G.

PROFICIO Investigators	Pooled Safety Analysis of Evolocumab in Over 6000 Patients From Double-Blind and Open-Label Extension Studies	CIRCULATION			English	Article						antibodies, monoclonal; cholesterol, LDL; long-term adverse events; myalgia; proprotein convertase 9	DENSITY-LIPOPROTEIN CHOLESTEROL; SUBTILISIN/KEXIN TYPE 9; HETEROZYGOUS FAMILIAL HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA; PLACEBO-CONTROLLED TRIAL; MONOCLONAL-ANTIBODY; AMG 145; RANDOMIZED-TRIAL; LDL-C; CARDIOVASCULAR EVENTS; NONHUMAN-PRIMATES	BACKGROUND: Evolocumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody to PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9), markedly reduces low-density lipoprotein cholesterol across diverse patient populations. The objective of this study was to assess the safety and tolerability of evolocumab in a pooled safety analysis from phase 2 or 3 randomized and placebo or comparator-controlled trials (integrated parent trials) and the first year of open-label extension (OLE) trials that included a standard-of-care control group. METHODS: This analysis included adverse event (AE) data from 6026 patients in 12 phase 2 and 3 parent trials, with a median exposure of 2.8 months, and, of those patients, from 4465 patients who continued with a median follow-up of 11.1 months in 2 OLE trials. AEs were analyzed separately for the parent and OLE trials. Overall AE rates, serious AEs, laboratory assessments, and AEs of interest were evaluated. RESULTS: Overall AE rates were similar between evolocumab and control in the parent trials (51.1% versus 49.6%) and in year 1 of OLE trials (70.0% versus 66.0%), as were those for serious AEs. Elevations of serum transaminases, bilirubin, and creatine kinase were infrequent and similar between groups. Muscle-related AEs were similar between evolocumab and control. Neurocognitive AEs were infrequent and balanced during the double-blind parent studies (5 events [0.1%], evolocumab groups versus 6 events [0.3%], control groups). In the OLE trials, 27 patients (0.9%) in the evolocumab groups and 5 patients (0.3%) in the control groups reported neurocognitive AEs. No neutralizing antievolocumab antibodies were detected. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, this integrated safety analysis of 6026 patients pooled across phase 2/3 trials and 4465 patients who continued in OLE trials for 1 year supports a favorable benefit-risk profile for evolocumab.

While mutations of PHF8 have been associated with cognitive defects and cleft lip/palate, its role in mammalian development and physiology remains unexplored. Here, we have generated a Phf8 knockout allele in mice to examine the consequences of Phf8 loss for development and behaviour. Phf8 deficient mice neither display obvious developmental defects nor signs of cognitive impairment. However, we report a striking resiliency to stress-induced anxiety-and depression-like behaviour on loss of Phf8. We further observe misregulation of serotonin signalling within the prefrontal cortex of Phf8 deficient mice and identify the serotonin receptors Htr1a and Htr2a as direct targets of PHF8. Our results clarify the functional role of Phf8 in mammalian development and behaviour and establish a direct link between Phf8 expression and serotonin signalling, identifying this histone demethylase as a potential target for the treatment of anxiety and depression.

Methods: We stratified 115 cognitively normal individuals into preclinical AD (both amyloid and tau pathologies present), asymptomatic at risk for AD (either amyloid or tau pathology present), or healthy controls (no amyloid or tau pathology present) using [F-18]florbetapir PET and CSF phosphorylated tau biomarkers. Regression and voxel-based regression models evaluated the relationships between baseline NPS measured by the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) and baseline and 2-year change in metabolism measured by [F-18] fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET. Results: Individuals with preclinical AD with higher NPI scores had higher [F-18] FDG uptake in the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), ventromedial prefrontal cortex, and right anterior insula at baseline. High NPI scores predicted subsequent hypometabolism in the PCC over 2 years only in individuals with preclinical AD. Sleep/nighttime behavior disorders and irritability and lability were the components of the NPI that drove this metabolic dysfunction. Conclusions: The magnitude of NPS in preclinical cases, driven by sleep behavior and irritability domains, is linked to transitory metabolic dysfunctions within limbic networks vulnerable to the AD process and predicts subsequent PCC hypometabolism. These findings support an emerging conceptual framework in which NPS constitute an early clinical manifestation of AD pathophysiology.

J	Dzieciolowska, S; Drapeau, P; Armstrong, GAB				Dzieciolowska, Stefania; Drapeau, Pierre; Armstrong, Gary Alan Barclay			Augmented quantal release of acetylcholine at the vertebrate neuromuscular junction following tdp-43 depletion	PLOS ONE			English	Article							AMYOTROPHIC-LATERAL-SCLEROSIS; WHITE MUSCLE-FIBERS; EMBRYONIC RED; MOTOR-NEURON; RNA TARGETS; IN-VIVO; ZEBRAFISH; ALS; DYSFUNCTION; MODEL	TAR DNA binding protein (TDP-43) is a 43 kD, predominately nuclear, protein involved in RNA metabolism. Of clinical significance is that the majority of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients display abnormal accumulation of misfolded TDP-43 in the cytoplasm, which is coincident with a loss of nuclear localization in the afflicted regions of the central nervous system. Little is known about defects that arise in loss-of-function models, in particular synaptic defects that arise at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ). In this report, we examined abnormalities arising at the NMJ following depletion of tdp-43 using a previously characterized mutant tardbp (encoding tdp-43) zebrafish line containing a premature stop codon (Y220X) that results in an unstable and degraded protein. Homozygous tardbp(Y220X/Y220X) zebrafish do not produce tdp-43 but develop normally due to expression of an alternative splice variant of tardbpl (tardbp paralog). Using an antisense morpholino oligonucleotide to knockdown expression of the tardbpl in tardbp(Y220X/Y220X) embryos, we examined locomotor defects, NMJ structural abnormalities and release of quantal synaptic vesicles at the NMJ. As in previous reports, larvae depleted of tdp-43 display reduced survival, gross morphological defects and severely impaired locomotor activity. These larvae also displayed an increased number of orphaned pre- and postsynaptic NMJ markers but surprisingly, we observed a significant increase (3.5 times) in the frequency of quantal acetylcholine release at the NMJ in larvae depleted of tdp-43. These results indicate that reduced TDP-43 levels alter quantal vesicle release at the NMJ during vertebrate development and may be relevant for understanding synaptic dysfunction in ALS.

J	Scellier, B; Bengio, Y				Scellier, Benjamin; Bengio, Yoshua			Equilibrium Propagation: Bridging the Gap Between Energy-Based Models and Backpropagation	FRONTIERS IN COMPUTATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						artificial neural network; backpropagation algorithm; biologically plausible learning rule; contrastive hebbian learning; deep learning; fixed point; Hopfield networks; spike-timing dependent plasticity	SYNAPTIC MODIFICATION; PLASTICITY; NETWORK	We introduce Equilibrium Propagation, a learning framework for energy-based models. It involves only one kind of neural computation, performed in both the first phase (when the prediction is made) and the second phase of training (after the target or prediction error is revealed). Although this algorithm computes the gradient of an objective function just like Backpropagation, it does not need a special computation or circuit for the second phase, where errors are implicitly propagated. Equilibrium Propagation shares similarities with Contrastive Hebbian Learning and Contrastive Divergence while solving the theoretical issues of both algorithms: our algorithm computes the gradient of a well-defined objective function. Because the objective function is defined in terms of local perturbations, the second phase of Equilibrium Propagation corresponds to only nudging the prediction (fixed point or stationary distribution) toward a configuration that reduces prediction error. In the case of a recurrent multi-layer supervised network, the output units are slightly nudged toward their target in the second phase, and the perturbation introduced at the output layer propagates backward in the hidden layers. We show that the signal "back-propagated" during this second phase corresponds to the propagation of error derivatives and encodes the gradient of the objective function, when the synaptic update corresponds to a standard form of spike-timing dependent plasticity. This workmakes it more plausible that a mechanism similar to Backpropagation could be implemented by brains, since leaky integrator neural computation performs both inference and error back-propagation in our model. The only local difference between the two phases is whether synaptic changes are allowed or not. We also show experimentally that multi-layer recurrently connected networks with 1, 2, and 3 hidden layers can be trained by Equilibrium Propagation on the permutation-invariant MNIST task.

Dysfunction of the Cerebral Glucose Transporter SLC45A1 in Individuals with Intellectual Disability and Epilepsy	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF HUMAN GENETICS			English	Article							GLUT1 DEFICIENCY SYNDROME; BLOOD-BRAIN-BARRIER; IDENTIFICATION; TRANSLOCATION	Glucose transport across the blood brain barrier and into neural cells is critical for normal cerebral physiologic function. Dysfunction of the cerebral glucose transporter GLUT1 (encoded by SLC2A1) is known to result in epilepsy, intellectual disability (ID), and movement disorder. Using whole-exome sequencing, we identified rare homozygous missense variants (c.526C>T [p.Arg176Trp] and c.629C>T [p.Ala210Val]) in SLC45A1, encoding another cerebral glucose transporter, in two consanguineous multiplex families with moderate to severe ID, epilepsy, and variable neuropsychiatric features. The variants segregate with the phenotype in these families, affect well-conserved amino acids, and are predicted to be damaging by in silico programs. Intracellular glucose transport activity of the p.Arg176Trp and p.Ala210Val SLC45A1 variants, measured in transfected COS-7 cells, was approximately 50% (p = 0.013) and 33% (p = 0.008) lower, respectively, than that of intact SLC45A1. These results indicate that residues at positions 176 and 210 are critical for the glucose transport activity of SLC45A1. All together, our data strongly suggest that recessive mutations in SLC45A1 cause ID and epilepsy. SLC45A1 thus represents the second cerebral glucose transporter, in addition to GLUT1, to be involved in neurodevelopmental disability. Identification of additional individuals with mutations in SLC45A1 will allow better definition of the associated phenotypic spectrum and the exploration of potential targeted treatment options.

J	O'Reilly, C; Lewis, JD; Elsabbagh, M				O'Reilly, Christian; Lewis, John D.; Elsabbagh, Mayada			Is functional brain connectivity atypical in autism? A systematic review of EEG and MEG studies	PLOS ONE			English	Article							SPECTRUM DISORDER; CORPUS-CALLOSUM; RESTING-STATE; WHITE-MATTER; INTERHEMISPHERIC CONNECTIVITY; YOUNG-CHILDREN; VISUAL-CORTEX; CORTICAL CONNECTIVITY; SOMATOSENSORY CORTEX; GAMMA-OSCILLATIONS	Background Although it is well recognized that autism is associated with altered patterns of over-and under-connectivity, specifics are still a matter of debate. Little has been done so far to synthesize available literature using whole-brain electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings. Objectives 1) To systematically review the literature on EEG/MEG functional and effective connectivity in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), 2) to synthesize and critically appraise findings related with the hypothesis that ASD is characterized by long-range underconnectivity and local overconnectivity, and 3) to provide, based on the literature, an analysis of tentative factors that are likely to mediate association between ASD and atypical connectivity (e.g., development, topography, lateralization). Methods Literature reviews were done using PubMed and PsychInfo databases. Abstracts were screened, and only relevant articles were analyzed based on the objectives of this paper. Special attention was paid to the methodological characteristics that could have created variability in outcomes reported between studies. Results Our synthesis provides relatively strong support for long-range underconnectivity in ASD, whereas the status of local connectivity remains unclear. This observation was also mirrored by a similar relationship with lower frequencies being often associated with underconnectivity and higher frequencies being associated with both under-and over-connectivity. Putting together these observations, we propose that ASD is characterized by a general trend toward an under-expression of lower-band wide-spread integrative processes compensated by more focal, higher-frequency, locally specialized, and segregated processes. Further investigation is, however, needed to corroborate the conclusion and its generalizability across different tasks. Of note, abnormal lateralization in ASD, specifically an elevated left-over-right EEG and MEG functional connectivity ratio, has been also reported consistently across studies. Conclusions The large variability in study samples and methodology makes a systematic quantitative analysis (i.e. meta-analysis) of this body of research impossible. Nevertheless, a general trend supporting the hypothesis of long-range functional underconnectivity can be observed. Further research is necessary to more confidently determine the status of the hypothesis of short-range overconnectivity. Frequency-band specific patterns and their relationships with known symptoms of autism also need to be further clarified.

In the present study, the spatial-cognitive importance of aCC and DMS was assessed in the hidden-platform version of the Morris water maze (MWM). Brain lesion experiments that focused on areas of connectivity between these regions indicated their involvement in spatial cognition. MWM learning curves were markedly delayed in DMS-lesioned mice in the absence of other major functional impairments, whereas there was a more subtle, but still significant influence of aCC lesions. Lesioned mice displayed impaired abilities to use spatial search strategies, increased thigmotaxic swimming, and decreased searching in the proximity of the escape platform. Additionally, aCC and DMS activity was compared in mice between the early acquisition phase (2 and 3 days of training) and the over-trained high-proficiency phase (after 30 days of training). Neuroplasticity-related expression of the immediate early gene Arc implicated both regions during the goal-directed, early phases of spatial learning. These results suggest the functional involvement of aCC and DMS in processes of spatial cognition that model associative cortex-dependent, human episodic memory abilities.

Methods: We analyzed 83 pediatric patients imaged serially from initial demyelinating attack: 18 with acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) and 65 with other monophasic ADS presentations (monoADS). We further subdivided the monoADS group by the presence (n = 33; monoADSlesion) or absence (n 5 32; monoADSnolesion) of T2 lesions involving the brain at onset. We used normative data to compare brain volumes and calculate age-and sex-specific z scores, and used mixed-effect models to investigate their relationship with time from demyelinating illness. Results: Children with monophasic demyelination (ADEM, non-ADEM with brain lesions, and those without brain involvement) demonstrated reduced age-expected brain growth on serial images, driven by reduced age-expected white matter growth. Cortical gray matter volumes were not reduced at onset but demonstrated reduced age-expected growth afterwards in all groups. Brain volumes differed from age-and sex-expected values to the greatest extent in children with ADEM. All patient groups failed to recover age-expected brain growth trajectories. Conclusions: Brain volume, and more importantly age-expected brain growth, is negatively affected by acquired demyelination, even in the absence of chronicity, implicating factors other than active inflammation as operative in this process.

J	Baron, M				Baron, Murray			Pros and cons of echocardiography in the screening, diagnosis and follow-up of patients with systemic sclerosis pulmonary arterial hypertension - a rheumatologist's perspective	JOURNAL OF SCLERODERMA AND RELATED DISORDERS			English	Article						Algorithms; Echocardiogram; Hypertension pulmonary; Pulmonary arterial hypertension; Scleroderma; Systemic sclerosis	BRAIN NATRIURETIC PEPTIDE; RIGHT-HEART CATHETERIZATION; DIFFUSING-CAPACITY; EXPERT CONSENSUS; METAANALYSIS; MULTICENTER; COHORT; PREVALENCE; ACCURACY; DYSPNEA	Purpose: Our objective was to review the evidence regarding echocardiography in patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc) and possible pulmonary hypertension (PH). Methods: The literature was reviewed. In addition, a survey was conducted of 315 rheumatologists/internists with a self-declared interest in SSc, to determine their preferred use of echocardiograms. Results: The most relevant literature findings come from two studies, the DETECT study and one from the Australian Scleroderma Interest Group. In both these studies, it appears that the use of non-echocardiographic variables such as pulmonary function tests (PFTs) and values of serum N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), are adequate on their own in suggesting which patients are at high risk of PH. Echocardiograms added very little information and in fact may confuse the picture by appearing to be normal when in fact underlying PH is present. With regard to the survey, 157 physicians (49.8%) responded. Of those, 67% felt that an echocardiogram should be ordered on every patient with SSc every year. Ninety-five percent (95%) said the reason was to screen for the development of significant PH, 65% said the reason was to screen for the development of significant intrinsic cardiac disease and 38% said that the reason was to adhere to accepted international recommendations. Conclusions: Despite popular belief and current recommendations, in the opinion of the author, echocardiograms are not necessary in every SSc patient every year. Cheaper tests such as PFTs and NT-proBNP are adequate in most cases to suggest when a right heart catheterization should be performed.

The impairment of visual functions is one of the most common complaints following mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). Traumatic brain injury-associated visual deficits include blurred vision, reading problems, and eye strain. In addition, previous studies have found evidence that TBI can diminish early cortical visual processing, particularly for second-order stimuli. We investigated whether cortical processing of binocular disparity is also affected by mTBI. METHODS. In order to investigate the influence of mTBI on global stereopsis, we measured the quick Disparity Sensitivity Function (qDSF) in 22 patients with mTBI. Patients with manifest strabismus and double vision were excluded. Compared with standard clinical tests, the qDSF is unique in that it offers a quick and accurate estimate of thresholds across the whole spatial frequency range. RESULTS. Results show that disparity sensitivity in the mTBI patients were significantly reduced compared with the normative dataset (n = 61). The peak spatial frequency was not affected. CONCLUSIONS. Our results suggest that the reduced disparity sensitivity in patients with mTBI is more likely caused by cortical changes (e.g., axonal shearing, or reduced interhemispheric communication) rather than oculomotor dysfunction.

Patients receive specialized care inside the neurology ward and delays in admission to the ward will have negative impact on their health status. The level of this impact varies among patient types and depends on the severity of patients. Patients are also different in terms of arrival rate and length of stay at the ward. The patients normally wait in the emergency department until a ward bed is assigned to them. We formulate this problem as an infinite-horizon average cost dynamic program and propose an efficient approximation scheme to solve large-scale problem instances. The computational results from applying our model to a neurology ward show that dynamic policies generated by our approach can reduce the overall deterioration in patients' health status compared to several alternative policies.

It was shown that training was an important factor affecting blood plasma level of IL both at rest and after single forced swimming: in trained animals, the concentration of both myokines increased immediately after swimming, while in untrained animals, this increase was observed only after 5 h. Changes in cytokine production against the background of training can be associated with various factors, including neuroendocrine mechanisms, stress, modification of intracellular signaling, as well as reorganization of transcriptional mechanisms in muscle fibers. The most important factor is shift in the ratio of monovalent cations (sodium and potassium) in the cytoplasm.	[Kapilevich, L. V.; Kironenko, T. A.; Zakharova, A. N.; Kabachkova, A. V.; Orlov, S.

We aimed to test differences between healthy subjects and patients with respect to slow wave activity during wakefulness and sleep. Methods. Fifteen patients affected by nonlesional focal epilepsy originating within temporal areas and fourteen matched controls underwent a 24-hour EEG recording. We studied the EEG power spectral density during wakefulness and sleep in delta (1-4 Hz), theta (5-7 Hz), alpha (8-11 Hz), sigma (12-15 Hz), and beta (16-20 Hz) bands. Results. During sleep, patients with focal epilepsy showed higher power from delta to beta frequency bands compared with controls. The effect was widespread for alpha band and above, while localized over the affected hemisphere for delta (sleep cycle 1, P = .006; sleep cycle 2, P = .008; sleep cycle 3, P = .017). The analysis of interhemispheric differences showed that the only frequency band stronger over the affected regions was the delta band during the first 2 sleep cycles (sleep cycle 1, P = .014; sleep cycle 2, P = .002). During wakefulness, patients showed higher delta/theta activity over the affected regions compared with controls. Conclusions. Patients with focal epilepsy showed a pattern of power increases characterized by a selective slow wave activity enhancement over the epileptic regions during daytime and sleep. This phenomenon was stronger and asymmetric during the first sleep cycles.

So far, studies aimed at evaluating whether age at surgery is a factor influencing surgical outcome are lacking, so that data on the comparison between patients harboring Type II FCD operated at younger age and those operated at adult age are still scarce. We compared presurgical clinical features and surgical outcomes of patients with histopathologically diagnosed Type II FCD undergoing surgery at an earlier age with those operated after 20 years of age. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 1660 consecutive patients operated at the "Claudio Munari" Epilepsy Surgery Centre. There were 289 patients (17.4%) with a neuropathological diagnosis of Type II FCD. We included two different groups of patients, the first one including patients operated on at less than 6 years, the second sharing the same seizure onset age but with delayed surgery, carried out after the age of 20. Seizure characteristics and, neuropsychological and postoperative seizure outcomes were evaluated by study group. Results: Forty patients underwent surgery before the age of 6 and 66 patients after the age of 20. Surgical outcome was favorable in the whole population (72.6% were classified in Engel's Class Ia + Ic), independently from age at surgery. In the children group, 32 patients were classified in Class I, including 30 (75%) children in classes Ia and Ic. In the adult group, 53 belonged to Class I of whom 47 (71%) were in classes Ia and Ic. The percentage of permanent complications, the surgical outcomes, and AED withdrawal did not significantly differ by study group. Conclusion: Our results indicate that there is no difference between the groups, suggesting that outcome depends mainly on the histological findings and not on timing of surgery.

Phase 1/2 Trial of 5-Fraction Stereotactic Radiosurgery With 5-mm Margins With Concurrent and Adjuvant Temozolomide in Newly Diagnosed Supratentorial Glioblastoma: Health-Related Quality of Life Results	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RADIATION ONCOLOGY BIOLOGY PHYSICS			English	Article							HIGH-GRADE GLIOMA; RADIATION-THERAPY; HYPOFRACTIONATED RADIOTHERAPY; MALIGNANT GLIOMA; PLUS CONCOMITANT; CLINICAL-TRIALS; MDASI-BT; MULTIFORME; VALIDATION; BEVACIZUMAB	Purpose: We report a longitudinal assessment of health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in patients with glioblastoma (GBM) treated on a prospective dose escalation trial of 5-fraction stereotactic radiosurgery (25-40 Gy in 5 fractions) with concurrent and adjuvant temozolomide. Methods: HRQOL was assessed using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) quality of life questionnaire core-30 (QLQ-C30) general, the EORTC quality of life questionnaire-brain cancer specific module (QLQ-BN20), and the M.D. Anderson Symptom InventoryeBrain Tumor (MDASI-BT). Questionnaires were completed at baseline and at every follow-up visit after completion of radiosurgery. Changes from baseline for 9 predefined HRQOL measures (global quality of life, physical functioning, social functioning, emotional functioning, motor dysfunction, communication deficit, fatigue, insomnia, and future uncertainty) were calculated at every time point. Results: With a median follow-up time of 10.4 months (range, 0.4-52 months), 139 total HRQOL questionnaires were completed by the 30 patients on trial. Compliance with HRQOL assessment was 76% at 12 months. Communication deficit significantly worsened over time, with a decline of 1.7 points per month (P = .008). No significant changes over time were detected in the other 8 scales of our primary analysis, including global quality of life. Although 8 patients (27%) experienced adverse radiation effects (ARE) on this dose escalation trial, it was not associated with a statistically significant decline in any of the primary HRQOL scales. Disease progression was associated with communication deficit, with patients experiencing an average worsening of 13.9 points per month after progression compared with 0.7 points per month before progression (P = .01). Conclusion: On this 5-fraction dose escalation protocol for newly diagnosed GBM, overall HRQOL remained stable and appears similar to historical controls of 30 fractions of radiation therapy. Tumor recurrence was associated with worsening communication deficit, and ARE did not correlate with a decline in HRQOL. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The aim of this study was to translate, culturally adapt, and validate the PCS questionnaire in Arabic. Methods: A systematic translation process was used to translate the original English PCS into Arabic. After the pilot study, we validated our version among patients with chronic pain at two tertiary care centers. We tested the reliability of our version using internal consistency and test-retest reliability. We examined the validity by assessing construct validity, concurrent validity (by investigating the associations with Brief Pain Inventory [BPI]), and face validity. Results: A total of 113 subjects (50 men, 63 women) were included in the study. Cronbach's a was 0.94 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.92-0.96), and interclass correlation coefficients was 0.83 (95% CI: 0.77-0.89) for the total scale. There was no statistically significant difference in the total PCS scores between patients who reported experiencing current pain and those who did not. Among patients who reported having current pain, pain severity was weakly associated with the total PCS scores (r = 0.22, P = 0.03). PCS and its subscales were not statistically significantly associated with any of the BPI items. Nonetheless, patients who were diagnosed with neuropathic pain had statistically significantly higher scores on the total PCS, rumination, and helplessness subscales. Most patients found the PCS questions to be clear and easy to understand, and thought the questionnaire items covered all their problem areas regarding their pain catastrophizing. Conclusion: Our translated version of PCS is reliable and valid for use among Arabic-speaking patients.

Hippocampal shape alterations are associated with regional A beta load in cognitively normal elderly individuals	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Alzheimer's disease; beta-amyloid; hippocampal shape; magnetic resonance imaging; positron emission tomography	PRECLINICAL ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; MEDIAL TEMPORAL-LOBE; PROBABILISTIC ATLAS; AMYLOID DEPOSITION; HUMAN BRAIN; MEMORY LOSS; VOLUME; MILD; IMPAIRMENT; DEMENTIA	A beta deposition is a driving force of Alzheimer's disease pathology and can be detected early by amyloid positron emission tomography. Identifying presymptomatic structural brain changes associated with A beta deposition might lead to a better understanding of its consequences and provide early diagnostic information. In this respect we analyzed measures of cortical thickness and subcortical volumes along with hippocampal, thalamic and striatal shape and surface area by applying novel analysis strategies for structural magnetic resonance imaging. We included 69 cognitively normal elderly subjects after careful clinical and neuropsychological workup. Standardized uptake value ratios (cerebellar reference) for uptake of 11-C-Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB) were calculated from positron emission tomographic data for a cortical measurement and for bilateral hippocampus, thalamus and striatum. Associations to shape, surface area, volume and cortical thickness were tested using regression models that included significant predictors as covariates. Left anterior hippocampal shape was associated with regional PiB uptake (P < 0.05, FDR corrected), whereas volumes of the hippocampi and their subregions were not associated with cortical or regional PiB uptake (all P > 0.05, FDR corrected). Within the entorhinal cortical region of both hemispheres, thickness was negatively associated with cortical PiB uptake (P < 0.05, FDR corrected). Hence, localized shape measures and cortical thickness may be potential biomarkers of presymptomatic Alzheimer's disease.

With data on acute infections detected in blood donors, an estimate of the degree of underrecognition was produced. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: All 2012 donors were tested for WNV infection with the use of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). With the number of cases detected, the number of donors tested, our estimate of the duration of viremia, an estimate of the population at risk, and the ratio of WNND to total cases, an expected number of WNND cases was calculated. A Monte Carlo simulation was used to estimate the range of several of these variables. RESULTS: Seventeen RT-PCR-positive donors were found among 52,309 donations tested. In the base case, the total number of cases was 16,095 and the expected number of WNND cases was 115. In the Monte Carlo simulation, the mean number of expected WNND cases was 136, and the median was 129. Since only 85 cases were reported to PHAs, it is estimated that between 26 and 37.5% of cases occurring in the province went undetected. CONCLUSION: The observation that close to one-third of cases of WNND went undetected because of the omission of appropriate laboratory testing indicates the need for improvement in the investigation of acute neurologic syndrome of suspected infectious etiology in Quebec.

Previous studies have argued that the detection of RF patterns is either achieved globally by a specialized global shape mechanism, or locally using as cue the maximum tangent orientation difference between the RF pattern and the circle. Here we challenge both ideas and suggest instead a model that accounts not only for the detection of RF patterns but also for line frequency patterns (LF), i.e. contours sinusoidally modulated around a straight line. The model has two features. The first is that the detection of both RF and LF patterns is based on curvature differences along the contour. The second is that this curvature metric is subject to what we term the Curve Frequency Sensitivity Function, or CFSF, which is characterized by a flat followed by declining response to curvature as a function of modulation frequency, analogous to the modulation transfer function of the eye. The evidence that curvature forms the basis for detection is that at very low modulation frequencies (1-3 cycles for the RF pattern) there is a dramatic difference in thresholds between the RF and LF patterns, a difference however that disappears at medium and high modulation frequencies. The CFSF feature on the other hand explains why thresholds, rather than continuously declining with modulation frequency, asymptote at medium and high modulation frequencies. In summary, our analysis suggests that the detection of shape modulations is processed by a common curvature-sensitive mechanism that is subject to a shape-frequency dependent transfer function. This mechanism is independent of whether the modulation is applied to a circle or a straight line. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Schmidtmann, Gunnar; Kingdom, Frederick A.

Here, we used network-based statistics (NBS) and graph theoretical analyses to study structural changes in the brain as a function of cognitive training. Fifty-six young women were divided in two groups (experimental and control). We assessed their cognitive function before and after completing a working memory intervention using a comprehensive battery that included fluid and crystallized abilities, working memory and attention control, and we also obtained structural MRI images. We acquired and analyzed diffusion-weighted images to reconstruct the anatomical connectome and we computed standardized changes in connectivity as well as group differences across time using NBS. We also compared group differences relying on a variety of graph-theory indices (clustering, characteristic path length, global and local efficiency and strength) for the whole network as well as for the sub-network derived from NBS analyses. Finally, we calculated correlations between these graph indices and training performance as well as the behavioral changes in cognitive function. Our results revealed enhanced connectivity for the training group within one specific network comprised of nodes/regions supporting cognitive processes required by the training (working memory, interference resolution, inhibition, and task engagement). Significant group differences were also observed for strength and global efficiency indices in the sub-network detected by NBS. Therefore, the connectome approach is a valuable method for tracking the effects of cognitive training interventions across specific sub-networks. Moreover, this approach allows for the computation of graph theoretical network metrics to quantify the topological architecture of the brain network detected. The observed structural brain changes support the behavioral results reported earlier (see Colom, Roman, et al., 2013) (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Most infected newborns are asymptomatic, but up to 20% develop sensorineural hearing loss or other permanent neurologic sequelae. The presentation of newborns with symptomatic cCMV is highly variable, and the infection is usually not diagnosed in the absence of a screening program. Newborn cCMV screening programs are estimated to be beneficial and cost-effective, and are increasingly being implemented. Diagnosis requires direct detection of virus in a sample obtained before 3 weeks of life, and is best performed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of saliva or urine, either of which is more sensitive than dried blood spot. Antiviral treatment of selected newborns with cCMV-related disease appears to improve hearing and neurocognitive outcomes. All infected infants should be evaluated promptly to determine appropriate therapy, and receive close audiologic and developmental follow-up.

An open question is how the transition to a social lifestyle has shaped, and been shaped by, the underlying neurohormonal machinery of social behaviour. The nonapeptide neurohormones, implicated in the regulation of social behaviours, are prime candidates for the neuroendocrine substrates of social evolution. Here, we examined the brains of eight cichlid fish species with divergent social systems, comparing the number and size of preoptic neurons that express the nonapeptides isotocin and vasotocin. While controlling for the influence of phylogeny and body size, we found that the highly social cooperatively breeding species (n= 4) had fewer parvocellular isotocin neurons than the less social independently breeding species (n= 4), suggesting that the evolutionary transition to group living and cooperative breeding was associated with a reduction in the number of these neurons. In a complementary analysis, we found that the size and number of isotocin neurons significantly differentiated the cooperatively breeding from the independently breeding species. Our results suggest that isotocin is related to sociality in cichlids and may provide a mechanistic substrate for the evolution of sociality.

Economic Burden of Herpes Zoster ("culebrilla") in Latin America	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES			English	Article						Herpes zoster; burden of disease; healthcare cost; Latin America	QUALITY-OF-LIFE; POSTHERPETIC NEURALGIA; OLDER-ADULTS; COST-EFFECTIVENESS; VACCINE; EPIDEMIOLOGY; PREVENTION; IMPACT; PAIN	Background: Herpes zoster (HZ) is characterized by debilitating pain and blistering dermatomal rash. The most common complication of HZ is postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), a persistent pain that can substantially affect patients' quality of life. HZ has significant impact on patients' lives with considerable implications for healthcare systems and society. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the healthcare resource utilization (HCRU) and medical costs associated with HZ in Latin America. Method: We conducted a pooled-analysis of three prospective cohort studies of HZ patients > 50 years of age in Argentina (n = 96); Brazil (n = 145) and Mexico (n = 142). Patients were recruited at different timepoints during their HZ episode and were followed for six months. The incidence of PHN was defined as a worst ZBPI pain score of >= 3, persisting or appearing more than 90 days after the onset of rash. Work effectiveness was measured on a 100-point Likert scale where 100 was described as completely effective (able to work like before HZ began) and 0 as not effective at all. Direct costs included costs due to use of antiviral medications and all medical services used to treat HZ. Indirect cost was based on foregone earnings from patients due to work loss and presenteeism, and work loss by family caretakers. One-way sensitivity analysis was performed to assess the impact on total costs. All costs are reported in 2015 USD currency. Results: 383 HZ patients were included and PHN incidence was 38.6%. The most commonly used resources were visits to the doctor's office (79.1% of patients), the emergency room (48.8%) and a specialist (37.9%); hospitalization was reported for 5.7% of patients. The overall direct cost per case was $ 763.19 USD, indirect cost was $ 701.40, for a total of $ 1,464.59 per HZ episode in Latin America. Total cost associated with HZ in patients with PHN was markedly higher compared to patients without PHN ($ 2,001.13 vs. $ 867.72, respectively) with indirect costs accounting for the most part of this difference. The sensitivity analysis was generally robust to changes in the assumptions made. Conclusion: HZ and its sequelae impose a substantial economic burden in Latin America which is expected to rise as the population ages and the number of HZ cases increases. The results support the need for early intervention, preventative strategies and improved disease management to reduce the HZ-associated disease burden in Latin America. (C) 2017 Merck Research Labs.

Therapeutic benefits of the methyl donor S-adenosylmethionine on nerve injury-induced mechanical hypersensitivity and cognitive impairment in mice	PAIN			English	Article						Animal model; DNA methylation; Epigenetics; Nutritional supplement; Cognitive impairment	CHRONIC NEUROPATHIC PAIN; ADENOSYL-L-METHIONINE; LOW-BACK-PAIN; DNA METHYLATION; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; EPIGENETIC MECHANISMS; RAT MODEL; CLINICAL-TRIAL; DOUBLE-BLIND; MOUSE MODEL	Despite considerable advances in understanding mechanisms involved in chronic pain, effective treatment remains elusive. Comorbid conditions including anxiety, depression, and cognitive impairment further impact quality of life. Chronic pain is associated with reversible changes in brain anatomy and function and with long-term changes in gene expression. Epigenetic mechanisms, including DNA methylation, contribute to wide-spread and long-lasting reprogramming of gene expression. We previously reported decreases in global DNA methylation in the mouse frontal cortex 6 months after induction of neuropathic pain using the spared nerve injury (SNI) model. Here, we examined the therapeutic effect of increasing DNA methylation using the methyl donor S-adenosylmethionine (SAM). S-adenosylmethionine is marketed as a nutritional supplement for a range of conditions including liver disease, depression, osteoarthritis, fibromyalgia, and dementia. Three months after SNI or sham surgery, animals were treated with SAM(20mg/kg, 3x/week) or saline orally for 4 months, and the impact on sensory, motor, motivational, and cognitive indices was measured. S-adenosylmethionine attenuated SNI-induced mechanical hypersensitivity and reduced active avoidance of mechanical stimuli but had no effect on cold sensitivity or motor capacity. S-adenosylmethionine completely blocked nerve injury-induced cognitive impairment and attenuated SNI-induced decreases in global DNA methylation in the frontal cortex. In summary, chronic oral administration of the methyl donor, SAM, attenuated sensory and cognitive symptoms associated with nerve injury in mice. These effects may be mediated, in part, through modulation of DNA methylation in the central nervous system by systemic administration of the methyl donor SAM.

The study purpose was to validate the use of the 8-item Behavior Pain Assessment Tool (BPAT) in patients hospitalized in 192 intensive care units from 28 countries. A total of 4812 procedures in 3851 patients were included in data analysis. Patients were assessed with the BPAT before and during procedures by 2 different raters (mostly nurses and physicians). Those who were able to self-report were asked to rate their pain intensity and pain distress on 0 to 10 numeric rating scales. Interrater reliability of behavioral observations was supported by moderate (0.43-0.60) to excellent (> 0.60) kappa coefficients. Mixed effects multilevel logistic regression models showed that most behaviors were more likely to be present during the procedure than before and in less sedated patients, demonstrating discriminant validation of the tool use. Regarding criterion validation, moderate positive correlations were found during procedures between the mean BPAT scores and the mean pain intensity (r = 0.54) and pain distress (r = 0.49) scores (P < 0.001). Regression models showed that all behaviors were significant predictors of pain intensity and pain distress, accounting for 35% and 29% of their total variance, respectively. A BPAT cut-point score > 3.5 could classify patients with or without severe levels (> 8) of pain intensity and distress with sensitivity and specificity findings ranging from 61.8% to 75.1%. The BPAT was found to be reliable and valid. Its feasibility for use in practice and the effect of its clinical implementation on patient pain and intensive care unit outcomes need further research.

Total folate and unmetabolized folic acid in the breast milk of a cross-section of Canadian women	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NUTRITION			English	Article						breastmilk; folate; folic acid; supplements; unmetabolized folic acid	ISOTOPE DILUTION ASSAYS; NEURAL-TUBE DEFECTS; LIQUID-CHROMATOGRAPHY; BINDING PROTEINS; LACTATING WOMEN; IN-VITRO; 5-METHYLTETRAHYDROFOLATE; BLOOD; BIOAVAILABILITY; SUPPLEMENTS	Background: Folate requirements increase during pregnancy and lactation. It is recommended that women who could become pregnant, are pregnant, or are lactating consume a folic acid (FA)-containing supplement. Objectives: We sought to determine breast-milk total folate and unmetabolized folic acid (UMFA) contents and their relation with FA-supplement use and doses in a cohort of Canadian mothers who were enrolled in the MIREC (Maternal-Infant Research on Environmental Chemicals) study. Design: Breast-milk tetrahydrofolate (THF), 5-methyl-THF, 5-formyl-THF, 5,10-methenyl-THF, and UMFA were measured with the use of liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (n = 561). Total daily supplemental FA intake was based on self-reported FA-supplement use. Results: UMFA was detectable in the milk of 96.1% of the women. Total daily FA intake from supplements was associated with breast folate concentration and species. Breast-milk total folate was 18% higher (P < 0.001) in supplement users (n = 401) than in nonusers (n = 160), a difference driven by women consuming >400 mu g FA/d (P <= 0.004). 5-Methyl-THF was 19% lower (P < 0.001) and UMFA was 126% higher (P < 0.001) in supplement users than in nonusers. Women who consumed.400 mg FA/d had proportionally lower 5-methyl-THF and higher UMFA than did women who consumed <= 400 mg FA/d. Conclusions: FA-supplement use was associated with modestly higher breast-milk total folate. Detectable breast-milk UMFA was nearly ubiquitous, including in women who did not consume an FA supplement. Breast-milk UMFA was proportionally higher than 5-methyl-THF in women who consumed >400 mu g FA/d, thereby suggesting that higher doses exceed the physiologic capacity to metabolize FA and result in the preferential uptake of FA in breast milk. Therefore, FA-supplement doses >400 mu g may not be warranted, especially in populations for whom FA fortification is mandatory.

Exophytic bulbar pilocytic astrocytoma and post-operative cerebral salt wasting syndrome	MEDICAL HYPOTHESES			English	Article							BRAIN NATRIURETIC PEPTIDE; DORSAL HYPOTHALAMIC AREA; NUCLEUS RAPHE PALLIDUS; SUBARACHNOID HEMORRHAGE; MEDULLA-OBLONGATA; HYPONATREMIA; INJURY; PATHOPHYSIOLOGY; CHILDREN; PROJECT	Cerebral salt wasting syndrome (CSWS) is a well-described consequence of several neurological disorders. Although the exact etiology of CSWS is still not completely elucidated, it is believed that the hypothalamus plays a pivotal role in the genesis of this disorder. We report for the first time 3 cases of CSWS occurring during the post-operative course following surgical resection of exophytic bulbar pilo-cytic astrocytomas in children. Since these 3 cases shared in common a medial implication of the medulla, we suggest that specific interconnectivity between the dorso-medial portion of the medulla oblongata and the hypothalamus might thus represent an anatomical pathway of interest in the pathogenesis of CSWS. Our findings suggest that the resection of medially located exophytic bulbar tumors might constitutes a risk factor in the development of CSWS. Particular care should thus be carried towards the prompt detection and treatment of CSWS in the post-operative courses of exophytic bulbar tumors. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Serotonergic Approaches in Parkinson's Disease: Translational Perspectives, an Update	ACS CHEMICAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Review						5-HT; Parkinson's disease; clinical; animal models; dyskinesia	DOPA-INDUCED DYSKINESIA; LEVODOPA-INDUCED DYSKINESIAS; RECEPTOR INVERSE AGONIST; MPTP-TREATED MONKEYS; ABNORMAL INVOLUNTARY MOVEMENTS; PSYCHOSIS-LIKE BEHAVIORS; DRUG-INDUCED PSYCHOSIS; SIDE-EFFECT PROFILE; DOUBLE-BLIND; TRANSPORTER BINDING	Parkinson's disease (PD) has long been seen as a disorder caused by degeneration of the dopaminergic system, leading to the classic motor manifestations of the disease. However, there is now overwhelming evidence that PD is more than a disease merely caused by dopamine depletion. It is well-known that a myriad of other neurotransmitters are affected by the disease process. One such neurotransmitter is serotonin (5-HT). 5-HT has been shown to play a role in several motor and nonmotor manifestations of PD, including tremor, cognition, depression and psychosis. 5-HT also seems to play a critical role in L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA)-induced dyskinesia. A breadth of preclinical studies and clinical trials have been conducted that aimed at modulating the 5-HT system in order to alleviate depression, cognitive deficits, psychosis, and dyskinesia. In this Review, we summarize recent advances in the 5-HT field in PD, but with a translational emphasis. We start by presenting a novel nonhuman primate model of PD that presents with dual dopamine and 5-HT lesions. We then present preclinical and clinical data that introduce new concepts, such as the use of biased and partial agonists, as well as molecules recently introduced to the field of PD, such as eltoprazine, pimavanserin, nelotanserin, and SYN-120, to enhance therapeutic benefit while minimizing adverse events, notably on parkinsonian disability.

Naloxegol, a polyethylene glycol derivative of naloxol, which is a derivative of naloxone and a peripherally acting mu-opioid receptor antagonist, targets the physiologic mechanisms that cause OIC. Pharmacologic measures of opioid activity and pharmacokinetic measures of central nervous system (CNS) penetration were employed to characterize the mechanism of action of naloxegol. At the human mu-opioid receptor in vitro, naloxegol was a potent inhibitor of binding (K-i = 7.42 nM) and a neutral competitive antagonist (pA(2) - 7.95); agonist effects were < 10% up to 30 mu M and identical to those of naloxone. The oral doses achieving 50% of the maximal effect in the rat for antagonism of morphine-induced inhibition of gastrointestinal transit and morphine-induced antinociception in the hot plate assay were 23.1 and 55.4 mg/kg for naloxegol and 0.69 and 1.14 mg/kg by for naloxone, respectively. In the human colon adenocarcinoma cell transport assay, naloxegol was a substrate for the P-glycoprotein transporter, with low apparent permeability in the apical to basolateral direction, and penetrated the CNS 15-fold slower than naloxone in a rat brain perfusion model. Naloxegol-derived radioactivity was poorly distributed throughout the rat CNS and was eliminated from most tissues within 24 hours. These findings corroborate phase 3 clinical studies demonstrating that naloxegol relieves OIC-associated symptoms in patients with chronic noncancer pain by antagonizing the mu-opioid receptor in the ENS while preserving CNS-mediated analgesia.

Abnormal sensorimotor processing and disturbed motor schemes, possibly attributable to cerebellar changes, remain unclear. Methods: We sought to characterize the extent of cerebellar dysfunction within the motor network using functional MRI activation analysis, connectivity analysis, and voxel-based morphometry in cervical dystonia patients ( n525, 15 women, mean age 45.8 years) and healthy volunteers ( n525, 15 women, mean age 44.7 years) in a visuospatial task requiring predictive motor timing. Results: Cervical dystonia patients showed decreased activation in the posterior cerebellar lobules as well as in the premotor areas, the associative parietal cortex, and visual regions. Patients also had decreased cerebellar connectivity with bilateral basal ganglia structures and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Conclusions: This promotes the view that dystonia results from miscommunication between the basal ganglia and cerebellar loops, thus providing new insights into the brain regions essential for the development of cervical dystonia.

High-frequency oscillations (HFOs; 80-500 Hz) seem better biomarkers for epileptogenic tissue than spikes. We studied how HFOs and spikes in combined pre- and postresection ECoG predict surgical outcome in different tailoring approaches. Methods: We, retrospectively, marked HFOs, divided into fast ripples (FRs; 250-500 Hz) and ripples (80-250 Hz), and spikes in pre- and postresection ECoG sampled at 2,048 Hz in people with refractory focal epilepsy. We defined four groups of electroencephalography (EEG) event occurrence: pre+post- (+/-), pre+post+ (+/+), pre-post+ (-/+) and pre-post- (-/-). We subcategorized three tailoring approaches: hippocampectomy with tailoring for neocortical involvement; lesionectomy of temporal lesions with tailoring for mesiotemporal involvement; and lesionectomy with tailoring for surrounding neocortical involvement. We compared the percentage of resected pre-EEG events, time to recurrence, and the different tailoring approaches to outcome (seizure-free vs recurrence). Results: We included 54 patients (median age, 15.5 years; 25 months of follow-up; 30 seizure free). The percentage of resected FRs, ripples, or spikes in pre-ECoG did not predict outcome. The occurrence of FRs in post-ECoG, given FRs in pre-ECoG (+/-, +/+), predicted outcome (hazard ratio, 3.13; confidence interval = 1.22-6.25; p = 0.01). Seven of 8 patients without spikes in pre-ECoG were seizure free. The highest predictive value for seizure recurrence was presence of FRs in post-ECoG for all tailoring approaches. Interpretation: FRs that persist before and after resection predict poor postsurgical outcome. These findings hold for different tailoring approaches. FRs can thus be used for tailoring epilepsy surgery with repeated intraoperative ECoG measurements.	[van 't Klooster, Maryse A.; van Klink, Nicole E. C.; Zweiphenning, Willemiek J. E.

Myoclonus Epilepsy and Ataxia due to KCNC1 Mutation: Analysis of 20 Cases and K plus Channel Properties	ANNALS OF NEUROLOGY			English	Article							RAMSAY-HUNT-SYNDROME; SOMATOSENSORY-EVOKED-POTENTIALS; UNVERRICHT-LUNDBORG-DISEASE; CORTICAL REFLEX MYOCLONUS; SPINOCEREBELLAR ATAXIA; MENTAL-RETARDATION; GOSR2 MUTATION; PHENOTYPE; MOVEMENT; NEURONS	Objective: To comprehensively describe the new syndrome of myoclonus epilepsy and ataxia due to potassium channel mutation (MEAK), including cellular electrophysiological characterization of observed clinical improvement with fever. Methods: We analyzed clinical, electroclinical, and neuroimaging data for 20 patients with MEAK due to recurrent KCNC1 p.R320H mutation. In vitro electrophysiological studies were conducted using whole cell patch-clamp to explore biophysical properties of wild-type and mutant K(V)3.1 channels. Results: Symptoms began at between 3 and 15 years of age (median = 9.5), with progressively severe myoclonus and rare tonic-clonic seizures. Ataxia was present early, but quickly became overshadowed by myoclonus; 10 patients were wheelchair-bound by their late teenage years. Mild cognitive decline occurred in half. Early death was not observed. Electroencephalogram (EEG) showed generalized spike and polyspike wave discharges, with documented photosensitivity in most. Polygraphic EEG-electromyographic studies demonstrated a cortical origin for myoclonus and striking coactivation of agonist and antagonist muscles. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed symmetrical cerebellar atrophy, which appeared progressive, and a prominent corpus callosum. Unexpectedly, transient clinical improvement with fever was noted in 6 patients. To explore this, we performed high-temperature in vitro recordings. At elevated temperatures, there was a robust leftward shift in activation of wild-type K(V)3.1, increasing channel availability. Interpretation: MEAK has a relatively homogeneous presentation, resembling Unverricht-Lundborg disease, despite the genetic and biological basis being quite different. A remarkable improvement with fever may be explained by the temperature-dependent leftward shift in activation of wild-type K(V)3.1 subunit-containing channels, which would counter the loss of function observed for mutant channels, highlighting KCNC1 as a potential target for precision therapeutics.

Methods: A cohort of 770 pCIS patients was followed up for at least 10 years. Cox proportional hazard models and Recursive Partitioning and Amalgamation (RECPAM) tree-regression were used to analyze data. Results: In pCIS, female sex and a multifocal onset were risk factors for a second clinical attack (hazard ratio [HR], 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.28, 1.06-1.55; 1.42, 1.10-1.84, respectively), whereas disease-modifying drug (DMD) exposure reduced this risk (HR, 95% CI = 0.75, 0.60-0.95). After pediatric onset MS (POMS) diagnosis, age at onset younger than 15 years and DMD exposure decreased the risk of a first Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS)-worsening event (HR, 95% CI = 0.59, 0.42-0.83; 0.75, 0.71-0.80, respectively), whereas the occurrence of relapse increased this risk (HR, 95% CI = 5.08, 3.46-7.46). An exploratory RECPAM analysis highlighted a significantly higher incidence of a first EDSS-worsening event in patients with multifocal or isolated spinal cord or optic neuritis involvement at onset in comparison to those with an isolated supratentorial or brainstem syndrome. A Cox regression model including RECPAM classes confirmed DMD exposure as the most protective factor against EDSS-worsening events and relapses as the most important risk factor for attaining EDSS worsening. Interpretation: This work represents a step forward in identifying predictors of unfavorable course in pCIS and POMS and supports a protective effect of early DMD treatment in preventing MS development and disability accumulation in this population.

This study examined sleep/wake activity after mTBI and its association with pain, a comorbidity often associated with insomnia. Methods: Actigraphy recording was performed for 7 2 consecutive days in 56 individuals at one month post-mTBI (64% male; 38 +/- 12 years), 24 individuals at one year post-mTBI (58% male; 44 +/- 11years), and in 20 controls (50% male; 37 12 years). Pain intensity and its effect on quality of life was assessed with a visual analogue scale and the Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) bodily pain subscale. Results: Overall, few differences in sleep/wake patterns were found between mTBI patients and controls. However, higher percentages of mTBI individuals with moderate-to-severe pain were found to require more than eight hours of sleep per day (37% vs11%; p = 0.04) and to be frequent nappers (defined as those who took three or more naps per week) (42% vs 22%; p = 0.04) compared to those with mild or no pain at one month postinjury. Correcting for age and depression, The SF-36 score was found to be a significant predictor of sleep duration exceeding eight hours per day at one month (odds ratio = 0.95; 95% confidence interval = 0.92-0.99; p = 0.01), but not at one year post-mTBI. Pain and increased sleep need (in terms of hours per day or napping frequency) were found to co-exist in as much as 29% of mTBI patients at one month postinjury. Conclusion: Pain could be associated with more pronounced sleep need in about one-third of mTBI patients during early recovery. Unalleviated pain, found in more than 60% of mTBI patients, should therefore be looked for in all mTBI patients reporting new onset of sleep disorder, not only in those with insomnia.

Ultrasonography for neuraxial blocks: a review of the evidence	MINERVA ANESTESIOLOGICA			English	Review						Anesthesia, caudal; Analgesia, epidural; Ultrasonography	RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIAL; EPIDURAL STEROID INJECTION; LOSS-OF-RESISTANCE; SPINAL-ANESTHESIA; ULTRASOUND GUIDANCE; LUMBAR PUNCTURE; PARTURIENTS; ANALGESIA; DELIVERY; OBESE	INTRODUCTION: This narrative review summarizes the evidence derived from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) pertaining to the use of adjunctive ultrasonography (US) for neuraxial blocks. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: The literature search was conducted using the MEDLINE, EMBASE and PUBMED databases. For the MEDLINE and EMBASE searches, the MESH terms "ultrasonography"and key word "ultrasound"were queried; using the operator "and", they were combined with the MESH terms "neuraxial block," "epidural anesthesia," "epidural analgesia," "spinal anesthesia," "spinal analgesia," "intrathecal anesthesia," "intrathecal analgesia," "caudal anesthesia,"and "caudal analgesia."For the PUBMED search, the search terms "ultrasound neuraxial," "ultrasound intrathecal," "ultrasound epidural"(limited to clinical trials), "ultrasound spinal"(limited to clinical trials), and "ultrasound caudal"(limited to clinical trials) were queried. Seventeen RCTs were retained for analysis. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Compared to conventional palpation of landmarks, US assistance (i.e., preprocedural scanning) results in fewer needle passes/insertions and skin punctures for neuraxial blocks in obstetrical and surgical patients. These benefits seem most pronounced when expert operators carry out the sonographic exams and for patients displaying difficult spinal anatomy. Preliminary findings also suggest that US provides similar pain relief and functional improvement to fluoroscopy for epidural/caudal steroid injection in patients afflicted with chronic spinal pain. Although one trial demonstrated shorter needling time with US guidance (i.e., real-time scanning of needle advancement) compared to US assistance, these findings require further validation. CONCLUSIONS: Published reports of RCTs provide evidence to formulate limited recommendations regarding the use of adjunctive US for neuraxial blocks. Further well-designed RCTs are warranted.

DESIGN: Prospective, comparative observational study. METHODS: Aqueous humor samples were obtained in 10 patients with acute NAION (within 14 days of symptom onset) and 15 control patients with age-related cataract. The levels of 6 cytokines-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), tumor necrosis factor (TNE)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-beta, IL-2, IL-6, and IL-8-were determined using multiplex bead immunoassay. The clinical characteristics of patients were also collected for correlation analysis. RESULTS: The mean concentration of VEGF (94.1 +/- 40.4 pg/mL) was significantly higher in the NAION group compared to the cataract controls (52.2 +/- 20.8 pg/mL; P = .010) and the mean concentration of IL-2 (5.56 +/- 1.27 pg/mL) was significantly lower in the NAION group than in the cataract controls (16.6 +/- 14.0 pg/mL; P = .002). There were no differences in the concentration of TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-6, and IL-8. There was a strong negative correlation between the VEGF concentration and the peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness at presentation (r = -0.657, P = .055). There was no significant correlation between the RNFL thickness and any other cytokines, the mean deviation on 24-2 Humphrey visual fields, or the duration of vision loss. CONCLUSIONS: Acute NAION is associated with higher VEGF and lower IL-2 concentrations without a change in other inflammatory cytokines. This has implications for future therapeutic interventions and diagnostic testing in patients with this acute optic neuropathy. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Methods Prospective national cohort study of children born between 2009 and 2011 at <29 weeks gestational age, admitted to one of 28 Canadian neonatal intensive care units and assessed at a Canadian Neonatal Followup Network site at 21 months corrected age for cerebral palsy (CP), visual, hearing and developmental status using the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development-Third Edition (Bayley-III). Stepwise regression analyses evaluated the effect of (1) prenatal and neonatal characteristics, (2) admission severity of illness, (3) major neonatal morbidities, (4) neonatal neuroimaging abnormalities, and (5) site on neurodevelopmental impairment (NDI) (Bayley-III score < 85, any CP, visual or hearing impairment), significant neurodevelopmental impairment (sNDI) (Bayley-III < 70, severe CP, blind or hearing aided and sNDI or death. Results Of the 3700 admissions without severe congenital anomalies, 84% survived to discharge and of the 2340 admissions, 46% (IQR site variation 38%-51%) had a NDI, 17% (11%-23%) had a sNDI, 6.4% (3.1%-8.6%) had CP, 2.6% (2.5%-13.3%) had hearing aids or cochlear implants and 1.6% (0%-3.1%) had a bilateral visual impairment. Bayley-III composite scores of <70 for cognitive, language and motor domains were 3.3%, 10.9% and 6.7%, respectively. Gestational age, sex, outborn, illness severity, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, necrotising enterocolitis, late-onset sepsis, retinopathy of prematurity, abnormal neuroimaging and site were significantly associated with NDI or sNDI. Site variation ORs for NDI, sNDI and sNDI/death ranged from 0.3-4.3, 0.04-3.5 and 0.12-1.96, respectively. Conclusion Most preterm survivors are free of sNDI. The risk factors, including site, associated with neurodevelopmental status suggest opportunities for improving outcomes.

Short- and Long-Term Reduction of Door-to-Needle Time in Thrombolysis for Acute Stroke	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF NEUROLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						stroke; thrombolysis; acute stroke; ischemic brain injury	ACUTE ISCHEMIC-STROKE; TISSUE-PLASMINOGEN ACTIVATOR; CODE SYSTEM; 25 MINUTES; DELAYS; GUIDELINES; ALTEPLASE; EFFICACY; OUTCOMES; TPA	Background: More timely administration of tissue plasminogen activator (alteplase) for patients with acute ischemic stroke yields greater clinical benefits. We implemented door-to-needle (DTN) time reduction strategies at our center and evaluated their short- and long-term effects on in-hospital treatment delays and clinical outcomes. Methods: Strategies, including stroke team prenotification, direct computed tomography transfer, not routinely waiting for laboratory results and alteplase delivery on the computed tomography table, were implemented in June 2013. We included all thrombolysed patients admitted directly to our hospital between January 2012 and March 2015. In-hospital delays and symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage rates were compared between patients pre- and postmodification, and the latter period was divided into early (first 6 months) and late (beyond 6 months) phases to assess the durability of our modifications. Results: Forty-eight individuals were treated premodification compared with 58 postmodification. The median DTN time was reduced from 75 to 46 minutes (p < 0.0001). The median DTN time in the early and late postmodification phases was not significantly different (41 vs 46 minutes, p = 0.4085). There was no significant difference in rates of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (4.2 vs 1.7%, p = 0.361) or stroke mimics (2.1 ves 5.2%, p = 0.625) Conclusions: We were able to decrease our DTN time for acute stroke thrombolysis by implementing relatively simple modifications and these improvements persisted over time.

In this study, we examined the characteristics of patients who left AMA after traumatic brain injury (TBI), their rates of follow-up visits, and readmission. Methods: We retrospectively studied 106 consecutive patients who left the tertiary trauma center AMA (1.8% of all admitted patients with a TBI). Preinjury health and social issues, mechanism of injury, computed tomography findings, and injury markers were collected. They were correlated to compliance with follow-up visits and unplanned emergency room (ER) visits and readmission rates. Results: The most prevalent premorbid health or social-related issues were alcohol abuse (33%) and assault as a mechanism of trauma (33%). Only 15 (14.2%) subjects came to follow-up visit for their TBI. Sixteen (15.1%) of the 106 subjects had multiple readmissions and/or ER visits related to substance abuse. Seven (6.6%) had multiple readmissions or ER visits with psychiatric reasons. Those patients with multiple readmissions and ER visits showed in higher proportion preexisting neurological condition (p=0.027), homelessness (p=0.012), previous neurosurgery (p=0.014), preexisting encephalomalacia (p=0.011), and had a higher ISS score (p=0.014) than those who were not readmitted multiple times. Conclusions: The significantly increased risks of multiple follow-up visits and readmission among TBI patients who leave hospital AMA are related to a premorbid vulnerability and psychosocial issues. Clinicians should target AMA TBI patients with premorbid vulnerability for discharge transition interventions.

Metastatic Spinal Cord Compression and Steroid Treatment A Systematic Review	CLINICAL SPINE SURGERY			English	Review						steroids; spinal metastases; epidural spinal cord compression; functional outcome; systematic review	HIGH-DOSE DEXAMETHASONE; RANDOMIZED-TRIAL; RADIOTHERAPY; NEOPLASMS; TUMOR	Study Design: Systematic review. Objectives: We conducted a systematic review of the literature to answer the following questions regarding the use of steroid therapy in metastatic spinal cord compression (MSCC): 1. In cases of MSCC, what is the effect of steroid administration before definitive radiotherapy or surgery on ambulatory status, bowel and bladder function and survival? 2. What steroid dosing regimens are associated with the best outcomes concerning neurological symptoms and complication prevention in cases of MSCC? Summary of Background Data: Currently, there is significant variation in the initial bolus dose, daily maintenance dose and duration of treatment when steroids are used as a bridge to definitive therapy for MSCC. Methods: A literature search following PRISMA guidelines was conducted in June 2016, using Medline via Ovid SP, Medline via PubMed, Embase, Biosis Previews and the Cochrane Library. Search terms used in each database varied slightly to optimize results. All generic steroid formulations were included along with spinal cord compression or myelopathy combined with metastatic or malignant tumors. Papers discussing acute traumatic causes of spinal cord compression were excluded, as were papers discussing cord compression from nonmetastatic tumors or epidural lipomatosis. Subjects were limited to adult humans undergoing definitive treatment with radiotherapy or surgery. Results: Of the 309 papers retrieved, 66 full text studies were reviewed and 6 papers were found to address the stated questions. Conclusions: There is a paucity of high quality literature evaluating the use of steroids in MSCC. On the basis of the evidence available an initial 10 mg intravenous bolus of dexamethasone followed by 16 mg PO QD has been associated with fewer complications compared with 100 mg bolus and 96mg QD. Weaning of steroids should occur rapidly after definitive treatment. Risk of gastric bleeding or perforation can be managed with the routine use of proton-pump inhibitors.

Although this effect could increase blood pressure by inducing fluid reabsorption and vasoconstriction, acute activation of arterial baroreceptors inhibits VP neurons via GABA(A) receptors to oppose high blood pressure. Here we review recent findings demonstrating that this protective mechanism fails during chronic high salt intake in rats. Recent Findings Two recent studies showed that chronic high sodium intake causes an increase in intracellular chloride concentration in VP neurons. This effect causes GABAA receptors to become excitatory and leads to the emergence of VP-dependent hypertension. One study showed that the increase in intracellular chloride was provoked by a decrease in the expression of the chloride exporter KCC2 mediated by local secretion of brain-derived neurotrophic factor and activation of TrkB receptors. Summary Prolonged high dietary salt intake can cause pathological plasticity in a central homeostatic circuit that controls VP secretion and thereby contribute to peripheral vasoconstriction and hypertension.

EEG/fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging), a noninvasive tool resulting in hemodynamic responses, could contribute to the generation of these hypotheses. This study assessed how these responses, despite their interictal origin, predict the seizure-onset zone (SOZ). Methods: We retrospectively studied 37 consecutive patients who underwent stereo-EEG (SEEG) and EEG/fMRI that resulted in significant hemodynamic responses. Hemodynamic response maps were co-registered to postimplantation anatomic imaging, allowing inspection of these responses in relation to SEEG electrode's location. The area containing the most significant t-value (primary cluster) explored with an electrode was assessed for concordance with SEEG-defined SOZ. Discriminant analysis was performed to distinguish the primary clusters having a high probability of localizing the SOZ. Results: Thirty-one patients had at least one study with primary cluster explored with an electrode, and 24 (77%) had at least one study with primary cluster concordant with the SOZ. Each patient could have multiple types of interictal discharge and therefore multiple studies. Among 59 studies from the 37 patients, 44 had a primary cluster explored with an electrode and 30 (68%) were concordant with the SOZ. Discriminant analysis showed that the SOZ is predictable with high confidence (>90%) if the primary cluster is highly significant and if the next significant cluster is much less significant or absent. Significance: The most significant hemodynamic response to interictal discharges delineates the subset of the irritative zone that generates seizures in a high proportion of patients with difficult-to-localize focal epilepsy. EEG/fMRI generates responses that are valuable targets for electrode implantation and may reduce the need for implantation in patients in whom the most significant response satisfies the condition of our discriminant analysis.

Care4Rare Canada Consortium	Compound heterozygous mutations in the gene PIGP are associated with early infantile epileptic encephalopathy	HUMAN MOLECULAR GENETICS			English	Article							MENTAL-RETARDATION SYNDROME; HYPOTONIA-SEIZURES SYNDROME; ANCHOR-SYNTHESIS PATHWAY; CONGENITAL-ANOMALIES; INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY; DEVELOPMENTAL DELAY; MABRY SYNDROME; CAUSE HYPERPHOSPHATASIA; MISSENSE MUTATIONS; GERMLINE MUTATION	There are over 150 known human proteins which are tethered to the cell surface via glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors. These proteins play a variety of important roles in development, and particularly in neurogenesis. Not surprisingly, mutations in the GPI anchor biosynthesis and remodeling pathway cause a number of developmental disorders. This group of conditions has been termed inherited GPI deficiencies (IGDs), a subgroup of congenital disorders of glycosylation; they present with variable phenotypes, often including seizures, hypotonia and intellectual disability. Here, we report two siblings with compound heterozygous variants in the gene phosphatidylinositol glycan anchor biosynthesis, class P (PIGP) (NM_153681.2: c.74T > C;p.Met25Thr and c.456delA;p.Glu153AsnFs*34). PIGP encodes a subunit of the enzyme that catalyzes the first step of GPI anchor biosynthesis. Both children presented with early-onset refractory seizures, hypotonia, and profound global developmental delay, reminiscent of other IGD phenotypes. Functional studies with patient cells showed reduced PIGP mRNA levels, and an associated reduction of GPI-anchored cell surface proteins, which was rescued by exogenous expression of wild-type PIGP. This work associates mutations in the PIGP gene with a novel autosomal recessive IGD, and expands our knowledge of the role of PIG genes in human development.

Gastrojejunostomy tube complications - A single center experience and systematic review	JOURNAL OF PEDIATRIC SURGERY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	48th Annual Meeting of the Canadian-Association-of-Pediatric-Surgeons (CAPS)	SEP 22-24, 2016	Vancouver, CANADA	Canadian Assoc Pediat Surg		Gastrojejunostomy tube; Pediatric; Infant; Complication; Perforation	JEJUNAL FEEDING TUBES; GASTROESOPHAGEAL-REFLUX; PERCUTANEOUS GASTROJEJUNOSTOMY; NEUROLOGIC IMPAIRMENT; CHILDREN; FUNDOPLICATION; GASTROSTOMY; PLACEMENT; EPIDEMIOLOGY; METAANALYSIS	Purpose: Gastrojejunostomy tubes (GJTs) enable enteral nutrition in infants/ children with feeding intolerance. However, complicationsmay be increased in small infants. We evaluated our single-institution GJT complication rate and systematically reviewed existing literature. Methods: With REB approval, a retrospective single-institution analysis of GJT placements between 2009 and 2015 was performed. For the systematic review, MOOSE guidelines were followed. Results: At our institution, 48 children underwent 154/159 successful insertions primarily for gastroesophageal reflux (n - 27; 55%) and aspiration (n - 11; 23%). Median age at first GJT insertion was 2.2 years (0.2-18). Thirty-five (73%) had an index insertion when <= 10 kg. GJTs caused 2 perforations and 1 death. The systematic review assessed 48 articles representing 2726 procedures. Overall perforation rate was estimated as 2.1% (n = 36 studies, 23/1092, 95% CI: 1.0-3.2). Perforation rates in children <10 kg versus = 10 kg were estimated as 3.1%/ procedure (95% CI: 1.1%-5.0%) and 0.1%/ procedure (95% CI: 0%-0.3%), respectively. The relative risk of perforation was 9.4 (95% CI: 2.8-31.3). Overall mortality was estimated as 0.9%/ patient (n = 39 studies; 95% CI: 0.2-1.6%). Most perforations (19/23; 83%) occurred = 30 days of attempted tube placement. Conclusion: Gastrojejunostomy tubes are associated with significant complications and frequently require revision/replacement. Insertion in patients <10 kg is associated with increased perforation risk. Caution is warranted in this subgroup. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Memory self-awareness in the preclinical and prodromal stages of Alzheimer's disease	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Amyloid; Anosognosia; Hypernosognosia; Metamemory; Mild Cognitive Impairment	MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; PITTSBURGH-COMPOUND-B; AMYLOID DEPOSITION; OLDER-ADULTS; COMPLAINTS; ANOSOGNOSIA; DECLINE; BRAIN; PET; DEMENTIA	While loss of insight of cognitive deficits, anosognosia, is a common symptom in Alzheimer's disease dementia, there is a lack of consensus regarding the presence of altered awareness of memory function in the preclinical and prodromal stages of the disease. Paradoxically, very early in the Alzheimer's disease process, individuals may experience heightened awareness of memory changes before any objective cognitive deficits can be detected, here referred to as hypernosognosia. In contrast, awareness of memory dysfunction shown by individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is very variable, ranging from marked concern to severe lack of insight. This study aims at improving our mechanistic understanding of how alterations in memory self-awareness are related to pathological changes in clinically normal (CN) adults and MCI patients. 297 CN and MCI patients underwent NB-PET (Positron Emission Tomography using Pittsburgh Compound B) in vivo amyloid imaging. Amyloid burden was estimated from Alzheimer's disease vulnerable regions, including the frontal, lateral parietal and lateral temporal, and retrosplenial cortex. Memory self-awareness was assessed using discrepancy scores between subjective and objective measures of memory function. A set of univariate analysis of variance were performed to assess the relationship between self-awareness of memory and amyloid pathology. Whereas CN individuals harboring amyloid pathology demonstrated hypernosognosia, MCI patients with increased amyloid pathology demonstrated anosognosia. In contrast, MCI patients with low amounts of amyloid were observed to have normal insight into their memory functions. Altered self-awareness of memory tracks with amyloid pathology. The findings of variability of awareness may have important implications for the reliability of self-report of dysfunction across the spectrum of preclinical and prodromal Alzheimer's disease.

Local morphology informs location of activation during navigation within the parahippocampal region of the human brain	BRAIN STRUCTURE & FUNCTION			English	Article						fMRI; Parahippocampal gyrus; Spatial memory; Navigation; Morphology; Human brain	MEDIAL TEMPORAL-LOBE; OBJECT-PLACE ASSOCIATIONS; HUMAN SPATIAL NAVIGATION; ENTORHINAL CORTEX; RIGHT HIPPOCAMPUS; MEMORY DEFICITS; LESIONS; GYRUS; AREA; MONKEY	The relationship between the local morphological features that define the entorhinal and parahippocampal cortex in the medial temporal region of the human brain and activation as measured during a navigation task with functional magnetic resonance imaging was examined individually in healthy participants. Two functional activation clusters were identified one within the caudal end of the collateral sulcus proper and the other in the parahippocampal extension of the collateral sulcus, clearly establishing the activation in the posterior parahippocampal cortex. A third activation cluster was identified where the anterior segment of the collateral sulcus proper gives way to the posterior segment, demonstrating also activation within the middle parahippocampal cortex. No activation was observed in the entorhinal cortex that lies medial to the rhinal sulcus or in the anterior part of the parahippocampal cortex along the anterior branch of the collateral sulcus proper. The activations could also be clearly differentiated from the cortex of the fusiform and lingual gyri that lie laterally and posteriorly. These findings demonstrated specific activation in the middle and posterior part of the parahippocampal cortex when information necessary for navigation was retrieved from a previously established cognitive map and demonstrate that the sulci that comprise the collateral sulcal complex represent important landmarks that can provide an accurate localization of activation foci along the parahippocampal cortex and allow identification of subdivisions involved in the processing of spatial information.

Curcumin exerts anti-inflammatory functions by interfering with LPS-induced dimerization of TLR4-myeloid differentiation protein-2 (MD-2) complex and suppressing pro-inflammatory mediator release. However, the inhibitory mechanism of curcumin remains to be defined. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH Binding of bis-demethoxycurcumin (GG6) and its cyclized pyrazole analogue (GG9), lacking the 1,3-dicarbonyl function, to TLR4-MD-2 was determined using molecular docking simulations. The effects of these compounds on cytokine release and NF-kappa B activation were examined by ELISA and fluorescence staining in LPS-stimulated primary microglia. Interference with TLR4 dimerization was assessed by immunoprecipitation in Ba/F3 cells. KEY RESULTS Both curcumin analogues bound to the hydrophobic region of the MD-2 pocket. However, only curcumin and GG6, both possessing the 1,3-diketone moiety, inhibited LPS-induced TLR4 dimerization, activation of NF-kappa B and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines in primary microglia. Consistent with the ability of 1,3-diketones to coordinate divalent metal ions, LPS stimulation in a low magnesium environment decreased pro-inflammatory cytokine release and NF-kappa B p65 nuclear translocation in microglia and decreased TLR4-MD-2 dimerization in Ba/F3 cells. Curcumin and GG6 also significantly reduced cytokine output in contrast to the pyrazole analogue GG9. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS These results indicate that phenolic 1,3-diketones, with a structural motif able to coordinate magnesium ions, can modulate LPS-mediated TLR4-MD-2 signalling. Taken together, these studies identify a previously uncharacterized mechanism involving magnesium, underlying the inflammatory responses to LPS.

Design: Retrospective cohort study design. Setting: Montreal Children's Hospital Concussion Clinic database. Patients: Children who sustained a concussion and sought care within 10 days of the injury, with complete medical history and Postconcussion Symptom Scale (PCSS) score available. Independent Variables: Total symptom score on the PCSS, sex, age, history of concussion, sleep disturbances, anxiety, learning disabilities, attention problems, and depression. Main Outcome Measure: Delayed recovery (28 days or more). Results: A total of 213 children (F = 76, M = 138) with a mean age of 13.89 +/- 2.55 years were included. Only total PCSS score at 10 days postinjury was identified as a significant predictor of delayed recovery (odds ratio: 1.019, P = 0.01). Conclusions: This study demonstrates the potential for clinicians to identify, with the sole use of the PCSS, children at risk of experiencing symptoms for longer periods of time.

To facilitate the identification of additional families, several groups have created "matching" platforms. We describe four individuals from three unrelated families "matched" by GeneMatcher and MatchMakerExchange. Individuals had microcephaly, developmental delay, epilepsy, and recessive mutations in TRIT1. A single homozygous mutation in TRIT1 associated with similar features had previously been reported in one family. The identification of these individuals provides additional evidence to support TRIT1 as the disease-causing gene and interprets the variants as "pathogenic." TRIT1 functions to modify mitochondrial tRNAs and is necessary for protein translation. We show that dysfunctional TRIT1 results in decreased levels of select mitochondrial proteins. Our findings confirm the TRIT1 disease association and advance the phenotypic and molecular understanding of this disorder.

A Review of Techniques Used in the Management of Growing Skull Fractures	JOURNAL OF CRANIOFACIAL SURGERY			English	Review						Craniofacial; dural defect; growing skull fractures; pediatric; skull fractures	EARLY-DIAGNOSIS; OPERATIVE MANAGEMENT; DURA-MATER; RECONSTRUCTION; CHILDHOOD; CHILDREN; SURGERY	Background: Growing skull fractures (GSFs) are rare complications of pediatric head trauma that comprise skull fractures associated with an underlying dural tear and an intact arachnoid membrane. They are often misdiagnosed, and delay inmanagement can lead to progression of the disease along with its neurological sequelae. Multiple clinical reports and qualitative reviews on this entity exist. To our knowledge, this represents the largest clinical review reporting on established techniques in the management of these fractures. Methods: A literature search was performed on the databases Embase, Medline, Cochrane, and PubMed from their inception until February 2015 using the terms "Growing,'' "Skull,'' "Fracture,'' and their equivalent terms. Studies included were case series with 5 or more patients describingGSFs and theirmanagement. Results: Twenty-two articles reporting 440 patients were included in the analysis. The mean age at trauma was 8.8 months, with the mean at presentation of 21.9 months and 57.8% of the patients being males. Most commonly, a combined dura-cranioplasty was done in 61.6% of the patients. A range of autoplastic and alloplastic materials were used in both of these techniques. Improvement from preoperative clinical status in seizures and neurological deficits was noted in 18 (12.7%) and 11 (7.05%) of the patients, respectively, following operative repair and medical management. Discussion: Early recognition is crucial in the management and treatment of GSF. Children at risk for developing GSF should be monitored clinically for up to 3months following the initial insult. The surgical treatment depends on the size of the fracture and the age of the patient. A summary of the presentation, management, associated outcomes, complications, and recommendations discussed in the literature are reported within.

Since the small GTPase Rab7A is involved in the trafficking of endosomes, autophagosomes, and lysosomes, and RAB7A gene expression and protein levels are up-regulated in AD patients, we tested the hypothesis that Rab7A was involved in tau secretion. We previously reported that both primary cortical neurons and HeLa cells over-expressing human TAU can release tau. Using these two cellular systems, we demonstrated that Rab7A regulates tau secretion. Upon Rab7A deletion, tau secretion was decreased. Consistent with this, the over-expression of a dominant negative and a constitutively active form of Rab7A decreased and increased tau secretion, respectively. A partial co-localization of tau and Rab7-positive structures in both neurons and HeLa cells indicated that a late endosomal compartment could be involved in its secretion. Collectively, the present data indicate that Rab7A regulates tau secretion and therefore the up-regulation of RAB7A reported in AD, could contribute to the extracellular accumulation of pathological TAU species that could result in the propagation of tau pathology in the AD brain.

To determine whether rs945270 might be a genetic determinant of ADHD, its effects on ADHDrelated symptoms and neural mechanisms of ADHD, such as response inhibition and reward sensitivity, were explored. Method: A large population sample of 1,834 14-year-old adolescents was used to test the effects of rs945270 on ADHD symptoms assessed through the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire and region-of-interest analyses of putamen activation by functional magnetic resonance imaging using the stop signal and monetary incentive delay tasks, assessing response inhibition and reward sensitivity, respectively. Results: There was a significant link between rs945270 and ADHD symptom scores, with the C allele associated with lower symptom scores, most notably hyperactivity. In addition, there were sex-specific effects of this variant on the brain. In boys, the C allele was associated with lower putamen activity during successful response inhibition, a brain response that was not associated with ADHD symptoms. In girls, putamen activation during reward anticipation increased with the number of C alleles, most significantly in the right putamen. Remarkably, right putamen activation during reward anticipation tended to negatively correlate with ADHD symptoms. Conclusion: These results indicate that rs945270 might contribute to the genetic risk of ADHD partly through its effects on hyperactivity and reward processing in girls.

Most animal studies on addiction focus on how much drug it takes to produce pathological drug use. How fast drugs get to the brain is generally ignored. A few studies have examined the influence of the speed of drug onset, but speed varied along with cumulative intake. Here we held average cumulative intake constant and determined whether variation in the speed of cocaine onset alone predicts outcome. Two groups of rats self-administered intravenous cocaine (0.25 mg/kg/injection) during daily sessions. Cocaine was available intermittently during each session. This produces the spikes and troughs in brain levels of cocaine thought to model how addicts take the drug. To vary the speed of cocaine onset, each injection was delivered over 5 s to one group, and over 90 s to the other. Average cumulative cocaine intake was the same in the two groups. However, rapid injections promoted robust psychomotor sensitization and potentiated incentive motivation for cocaine (0.063-0.25 mg/kg/injection). This addiction-relevant phenotype was accompanied by enhanced functional activity of metabotropic glutamate group II receptors (mGluR2/3s) in the prelimbic cortex and nucleus accumbens. Pharmacological activation of mGluR2/3s with LY379268 also preferentially decreased the motivation to take cocaine in rats previously exposed to rapid drug injections. Thus, varying the speed of drug onset can be used to parse the neurobiology of addiction from that of mere drug taking.(C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Strong opinions exist among physicians for and against the provision of care measures prolonging life. Objective: To describe current practice in the care of SMA1 in Canada, and explore the factors underlying inter-physician variability. Methods: A cross-sectional survey of Canadian hospital-based pediatric neurologists and pediatric respirologists was performed in 2015. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated to compare proportions between groups. Results: There was a 54% completion rate (99 physicians). Over half of participants believed that a disease modifying therapy was likely within 10 years. Quebec respirologists were 50 times less likely to offer long-term non-invasive ventilation (NIV) than respirologists in other provinces (OR 50.6, 95% CI 2.4-1075.3), and 20 times less likely to discuss tracheostomy with families (OR 20.4, 95% CI 2.0-211.8). High raters of perceived happiness of affected children were more likely to find NIV an acceptable measure for acute (OR 6.7, 95% CI 1.7-26.0) and chronic (OR 13.7, 95% CI 4.0-46.4) respiratory failure and prophylactic use (OR 5.8, 95% CI 2.2-15.6). Conclusion: Physician knowledge, opinions, subjective perception of child happiness, and regional factors, all influence physicians' practices and the shared decision-making process. Parents may not be informed or offered all the services available to their child. Knowledge translation initiatives are needed to enhance SMA1 care. (C) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Heavy Prenatal Alcohol Exposure is Related to Smaller Corpus Callosum in Newborn MRI Scans	ALCOHOLISM-CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Corpus Callosum; Neonatal Brain MRI; Manual Tracing; Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders; Prenatal Alcohol Exposure; Fetal Alcohol Syndrome	SPECTRUM DISORDERS; WHITE-MATTER; INTERHEMISPHERIC-TRANSFER; YOUNG-ADULTS; BRAIN; CHILDREN; MORPHOMETRY; DYSMORPHOLOGY; SEGMENTATION; AGE	BackgroundMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies have consistently demonstrated disproportionately smaller corpus callosa in individuals with a history of prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) but have not previously examined the feasibility of detecting this effect in infants. Tissue segmentation of the newborn brain is challenging because analysis techniques developed for the adult brain are not directly transferable, and segmentation for cerebral morphometry is difficult in neonates, due to the latter's incomplete myelination. This study is the first to use volumetric structural MRI to investigate PAE effects in newborns using manual tracing and to examine the cross-sectional area of the corpus callosum (CC). MethodsForty-three nonsedated infants born to 32 Cape Coloured heavy drinkers and 11 controls recruited prospectively during pregnancy were scanned using a custom-designed birdcage coil for infants, which increases signal-to-noise ratio almost 2-fold compared to the standard head coil. Alcohol use was ascertained prospectively during pregnancy, and fetal alcohol spectrum disorders diagnosis was conducted by expert dysmorphologists. Data were acquired using a multi-echo FLASH protocol adapted for newborns, and a knowledge-based procedure was used to hand-segment the neonatal brains. ResultsCC was disproportionately smaller in alcohol-exposed neonates than controls after controlling for intracranial volume. By contrast, CC area was unrelated to infant sex, gestational age, age at scan, or maternal smoking, marijuana, or methamphetamine use during pregnancy. ConclusionsGiven that midline craniofacial anomalies have been recognized as a hallmark of fetal alcohol syndrome in humans and animal models since this syndrome was first identified, the CC deficit identified here in newborns may support early identification of a range of midline structural impairments. Smaller CC during the newborn period may provide an early indicator of fetal alcohol-related cognitive deficits that have been linked to this critically important brain structure in childhood and adolescence.

We report that Dok-4 interacts with the transactivation domain of Elk-4 through an atypical phosphotyrosine-binding domain-mediated interaction. Dok-4 possesses a nuclear export signal and can relocalize Elk-4 from nucleus to cytosol, whereas Elk-4 possesses two nuclear localization signals that restrict interaction with Dok-4. The Elk-4 protein, unlike Elk-1, is highly unstable in the presence of Dok-4, through both an interaction-dependent mechanism and a pleckstrin homology domain-dependent but interaction-independent mechanism. This is reversed by proteasome inhibition, depletion of endogenous Dok-4 or lysine-to-arginine mutation of putative Elk-4 ubiquitination sites. Finally, Elk-4 transactivation is potently inhibited by Dok-4 overexpression but enhanced by Dok-4 knockdown in MDCK renal tubular cells, which correlates with increased basal and EGF-induced expression of Egr-1, Fos and cylcinD1 mRNA, and cell proliferation despite reduced Erk activation. Thus, Dok-4 can target Elk-4 activity through multiple mechanisms, including binding of the transactivation domain, nuclear exclusion and protein destabilization, without a requirement for inhibition of Erk.

Here, we investigate functional connectivity at rest (rs-FC) in musicians and nonmusicians to test for differences in auditory, motor, and audiomotor connectivity. As expected, musicians had stronger rs-FC between the right auditory cortex (AC) and the right ventral premotor cortex than nonmusicians, and this stronger rs-FC was greater in musicians with more years of practice. We also found reduced rs-FC between the motor areas that control both hands in musicians compared with nonmusicians, which was more evident in the musicians whose instrument required bimanual coordination and as a function of hours of practice. Finally, we replicated previous morphometric data to show an increased volume in the right AC in musicians, which was greater in those with earlier musical training, and that this anatomic feature was in turn related to greater rs-FC between auditory and motor systems. These results show that functional coupling within the motor system and between motor and auditory areas is modulated as a function of musical training, suggesting a link between anatomic and functional brain features.

Both cohorts showed a significant interaction between antenatal maternal depressive symptoms and infant GPRS(MDD) on the right amygdala volume. The Asian cohort also showed such interaction on the right hippocampal volume and shape, thickness of the orbitofrontal and ventromedial prefrontal cortex. Likewise, a significant interaction between SES and infant GPRS(MDD) was on the right amygdala and hippocampal volumes and shapes. After controlling for each other, the interaction effect of antenatal maternal depressive symptoms and GPRS(MDD) was mainly shown on the right amygdala, while the interaction effect of SES and GPRS(MDD) was mainly shown on the right hippocampus. Bioinformatic analyses suggested neurotransmitter/neurotrophic signaling, SNAp REceptor complex, and glutamate receptor activity as common biological processes underlying the influence of antenatal maternal depressive symptoms on fetal cortico-limbic development. These findings suggest gene-environment interdependence in the fetal development of brain regions implicated in cognitive-emotional function. Candidate biological mechanisms involve a range of brain region-specific signaling pathways that converge on common processes of synaptic development.

We hypothesized that a data-informed combination of features extracted from intraoperative microelectrode recordings (MERs) can predict the motor improvement of Parkinson's disease patients undergoing DBS surgery. We modified the employed RFs to account for unbalanced datasets and multiple observations per patient, and showed, for the first time, that only five neurophysiologically interpretable MER signal features are sufficient for predicting UPDRS improvement. This finding suggests that subthalamic nucleus (STN) electrophysiological signal characteristics are strongly correlated to the extent of motor behavior improvement observed in STN-DBS.

A contact force regulator capable of accurately applying mechanical stimuli to a live Drosophila larva could greatly facilitate mechanobiology research on Drosophila and may eventually lead to novel discoveries in mechanotransduction mechanisms of neuronal circuitries. In this paper, we present a novel contact force control scheme implemented in an automated Drosophila larvae micromanipulation system, featuring a switched fuzzy to proportional-differential (PD) controller and a noise-insensitive extended high gain observer (EHGO). The switched fuzzy-PD control law inherits the fast convergence of fuzzy control and overcomes its drawbacks such as large overshoot and steady-state oscillation. The noise-insensitive EHGO can reliably estimate system modeling errors and is robust to force measurement noises, which is advantageous over conventional high gain observers (sensitive to signal noises). Force control experiments show that, compared to a proportional-integral-differential (PID) controller, this new force control scheme significantly enhances the system dynamic performance in terms of rising time, overshoot, and oscillation. The developed robotic system and the force control scheme will be applied to mechanical stimulation and fluorescence imaging of Drosophila larvae for identifying new mechanotransduction mechanisms.

First, a novel identification scheme using modified optimal bounded ellipsoid based weight's updating laws is developed to identify the unknown nonlinear systems. By adding two additional terms to the original optimal bounded ellipsoid based weight's updating laws, the new modified identification scheme can achieve high convergence speed due to the adaptively adjusted learning gain at the beginning of the identification process and remain effective during the whole identification process. Based on the identified model, a new indirect adaptive control scheme for trajectory tracking problem using singular perturbation theory is developed, which is different from the control scheme proposed previously that can only be applied to a regulation problem. The closed-loop stability is analyzed and the convergence of system states is guaranteed. Experimental results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the identification and control scheme.

We conducted a study to elucidate the current state of practice and establish a warranted standard of care. An Internet-based study was sent to 180 pediatric neurosurgeons across the country and 102 craniofacial plastic surgeons in fourteen different countries, to collect data for primary indication for surgical management, preference for timing and choice of surgery, and pre-, peri-, and post-operative management options. The overall response rate from both groups was 32% (n = 90/284). Skull deformity was the primary indication for surgical treatment in patients without signs of hydrocephalus for both neurosurgeons and craniofacial surgeons (80% and 63%, respectively). Open surgical management was most commonly performed at six months of age by neurosurgeons (46%) and also by craniofacial surgeons (35%). Open surgical approach was favored for patients younger than four months of age by neurosurgeons (50%), but endoscopic approach was favored by craniofacial surgeons (35%). When performing an open surgical intervention, most neurosurgeons preferred pi or reversed pi procedure (27%), whereas total cranial vault remodeling was the most commonly performed procedure by craniofacial surgeons (37%). The data demonstrated a discrepancy in the treatment options for non-syndromic sagittal craniosynostosis. By conducting/comparing a wide survey to collect consolidative data from both groups of pediatric neurosurgeons and craniofacial plastic surgeons, we can attempt to facilitate the establishment of standard of care.

Other cognitive domains have been described to remain unaffected at the early stages of the disease and, therefore, excluded from diagnostic criteria. However, we show in this article that executive function (EF) disorders may be present in the 3 variants (nonfluent/agrammatic, logopenic, and semantic) of PPA. We also illustrate changes in language and EF by means of a 3-year behavioral and neuroimaging longitudinal study of a patient suffering from the semantic variant of PPA. This review provides an update on current knowledge of PPA, suggesting that dysexecutive symptoms may be encountered in the 3 PPA variants, in their early phases and/or in more advanced stages, when atrophy extends to adjacent brain areas.

CDEs have been created for several neurological diseases; the aim of this project was to develop CDEs specifically curated for mitochondrial disease (Mito) to enhance clinical research. Methods Nine working groups (WGs), composed of international mitochondrial disease experts, provided recommendations for Mito clinical research. They initially reviewed existing NINDS CDEs and instruments, and developed new data elements or instruments when needed. Recommendations were organized, internally reviewed by the Mito WGs, and posted online for external public comment for a period of eight weeks. The final version was again reviewed by all WGs and the NINDS CDE team prior to posting for public use. Results The NINDS Mito CDEs and supporting documents are publicly available on the NINDS CDE website (https://commondataelements. ninds.nih.gov/), organized into domain categories such as Participant/Subject Characteristics, Assessments, and Examinations. Conclusion We developed a comprehensive set of CDE recommendations, data definitions, case report forms (CRFs), and guidelines for use in Mito clinical research. The widespread use of CDEs is intended to enhance Mito clinical research endeavors, including natural history studies, clinical trial design, and data sharing. Ongoing international collaboration will facilitate regular review, updates and online publication of Mito CDEs, and support improved consistency of data collection and reporting.

Lithium Poisoning	JOURNAL OF INTENSIVE CARE MEDICINE			English	Article						enhanced elimination; extracorporeal treatment; neurotoxicity; syndrome of irreversible lithium effectuated neurotoxicity; intermittent hemodialysis; continuous renal replacement therapy; sodium polystyrene sulfonate	SODIUM POLYSTYRENE SULFONATE; WHOLE-BOWEL IRRIGATION; VENOVENOUS HEMODIAFILTRATION; EXTRACORPOREAL TREATMENTS; CLINICAL-PRACTICE; RAT-BRAIN; INTOXICATION; HEMODIALYSIS; TOXICITY; CLEARANCE	Lithium is a commonly prescribed treatment for bipolar affective disorder. However, treatment is complicated by lithium's narrow therapeutic index and the influence of kidney function, both of which increase the risk of toxicity. Therefore, careful attention to dosing, monitoring, and titration is required. The cause of lithium poisoning influences treatment and 3 patterns are described: acute, acute-on-chronic, and chronic. Chronic poisoning is the most common etiology, is usually unintentional, and results from lithium intake exceeding elimination. This is most commonly due to impaired kidney function caused by volume depletion from lithium-induced nephrogenic diabetes insipidus or intercurrent illnesses and is also drug-induced. Lithium poisoning can affect multiple organs; however, the primary site of toxicity is the central nervous system and clinical manifestations vary from asymptomatic supratherapeutic drug concentrations to clinical toxicity such as confusion, ataxia, or seizures. Lithium poisoning has a low mortality rate; however, chronic lithium poisoning can require a prolonged hospital length of stay from impaired mobility and cognition and associated nosocomial complications. Persistent neurological deficits, in particular cerebellar, are described and the incidence and risk factors for its development are poorly understood, but it appears to be uncommon in uncomplicated acute poisoning. Lithium is readily dialyzable, and rationale support extracorporeal treatments to reduce the risk or the duration of toxicity in high-risk exposures. There is disagreement in the literature regarding factors that define patients most likely to benefit from treatments that enhance lithium elimination, including specific plasma lithium concentration thresholds. In the case of extracorporeal treatments, there are observational data in its favor, without evidence from randomized controlled trials (none have been performed), which may lead to conservative practices and potentially unnecessary interventions in some circumstances. More data are required to define the risk-benefit of extracorporeal treatments and their use (modality, duration) in the management of lithium poisoning.

Comparative effectiveness of flexible versus rigid neuroendoscopy for endoscopic third ventriculostomy and choroid plexus cauterization: a propensity score-matched cohort and survival analysis	JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGERY-PEDIATRICS			English	Article						choroid plexus; endoscopic third ventriculostomy; hydrocephalus; neuroendoscope	CHILDREN CLINICAL ARTICLE; INFANT HYDROCEPHALUS; AFRICAN CHILDREN; MANAGEMENT; SUCCESS	OBJECTIVE Endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV)/choroid plexus cauterization (CPC) has become an increasingly common technique for the treatment of infant hydrocephalus. Both flexible and rigid neuroendoscopy can be used, with little empirical evidence directly comparing the two. Therefore, the authors used a propensity score-matched cohort and survival analysis to assess the comparative efficacy of flexible and rigid neuroendoscopy. METHODS Individual data were collected through retrospective review of infants younger than 2 years of age, treated at 1 of 2 hospitals: 1) Boston Children's Hospital, exclusively utilizing flexible neuroendoscopy, and 2) Nicklaus Children's Hospital-Jackson Memorial Hospital, exclusively utilizing rigid neuroendoscopy. Patient characteristics and postoperative outcomes were assessed, A propensity score model was developed to balance patient characteristics in the case mix. RESULTS A propensity score model for neuroendoscope type was developed with 5 independent variables: chronological age, sex, hydrocephalus etiology, prior CSF diversion, and prepontine scarring. Propensity score decile-adjusted and 1-to-1 nearest-neighbor matching analysis revealed that compared with flexible neuroendoscopy, rigid neuroendoscopy had an ETV/CPC failure odds ratio (OR) of 1.43 (p = 0.31) and 1.31 (p = 0.47), respectively, compared with an unadjusted OR of 2.40 (p = 0.034). Furthermore, in a Cox regression analysis controlled by propensity score, rigid neuroendoscopy had a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.10 (p = 0.70), compared with an unadjusted HR of 1.61 (p = 0.031). CONCLUSIONS Although unadjusted analysis suggested worse ETV/CPC outcomes for infants treated by rigid neuroendoscopy, much of the difference could be attributed to the case mix and other predictors of outcome. A larger sample observational study or randomized controlled trials are required to provide evidence-based guidelines on ETV/CPC technique.

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have uncovered a number of shared risk genes between schizophrenia and BD. The objectives of this study were to examine whether previously identified risk genes for BD are associated with negative symptom severity within a first-episode schizophrenia (FES) cohort and to examine whether such genes influence brain morphology. Methods: Patients experiencing FES were genotyped for 21 previously identified BD risk genes; a series of univariate analyses of covariance examined the association between negative symptom severity, as measured using the Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS), and genotype. A subset of participants underwent a structural 1.5 T MRI T-1 scan, analyzed for surface area and cortical thickness changes via the CIVET pipeline and LPBA40 atlas. Results: We included 133 patients with FES in our analysis; 61 of them underwent structural MRI. We observed a significant association between negative symptom severity and the BD risk gene FOXO6 (rs4660531). Individuals with the CC genotype presented significantly higher negative symptoms (Cohen d = 0.46, F = 5.854, p = 0.017) and significantly smaller surface area within the right middle orbitofrontal gyrus (Cohen d = 0.69, F = 7.289, p = 0.009) than carriers of allele A. Limitations: Limitations of this study include its modest sample size and lack of a control sample. Conclusion: Lacking the FOXO6 risk allele was associated with an increase in negative symptoms and surface area reduction in the right orbitofrontal gyrus - an area previously associated with negative symptoms - suggesting that presence of the FOXO6 risk allele confers resistance against negative symptoms and associated neuroanatomical changes in individuals with FES.

This chronic disease has a significant impact on the orofacial region that is involved in more than two-thirds of the cases. SSc patients can show a wide array of oral manifestations, which are usually associated with a severe impairment of the quality of life. They often present a decreased the salivary flow and a reduced mouth opening that contribute substantially to the worsening of the oral health status. Therefore, SSc patients require specific and multidisciplinary interventions that should be initiated as early as possible. The identification of specific radiological and clinical signs at the early stage will improve the management of such patients. This study reviews the wide spectrum of orofacial manifestations associated with SSc and suggests clues for the oral management that remains challenging.

Canadian Pediat Demyelinating Dis	White matter changes in paediatric multiple sclerosis and monophasic demyelinating disorders	BRAIN			English	Article						multiple sclerosis: imaging; acute disseminated encephalomyelitis; clinically isolated syndrome; demyelination; neuroinflammation	DIFFUSION-TENSOR; SEX-DIFFERENCES; WATER DIFFUSION; NERVOUS-SYSTEM; SPINAL-CORD; BRAIN; MRI; CHILDREN; ONSET; ARCHITECTURE	Most children who experience an acquired demyelinating syndrome of the central nervous system will have a monophasic disease course, with no further clinical or radiological symptoms. A subset will be diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, a life-long disorder. Using linear mixed effects models we examined longitudinal diffusion properties of normal-appearing white matter in 505 serial scans of 132 paediatric participants with acquired demyelinating syndromes followed for a median of 4.4 years, many from first clinical presentation, and 106 scans of 80 healthy paediatric participants. Fifty-three participants with demyelinating syndromes eventually received a diagnosis of paediatric-onset multiple sclerosis. Diffusion tensor imaging measures properties of water diffusion through tissue, which normally becomes increasingly restricted and anisotropic in the brain during childhood and adolescence, as fibre bundles develop and myelinate. In the healthy paediatric participants, our data demonstrate the expected trajectory of more restricted and anisotropic white matter diffusivity with increasing age. However, in participants with multiple sclerosis, fractional anisotropy decreased and mean diffusivity of non-lesional, normal-appearing white matter progressively increased after clinical presentation, suggesting not only a failure of age-expected white matter development but also a progressive loss of tissue integrity. Surprisingly, patients with monophasic disease failed to show age-expected changes in diffusion parameters in normal-appearing white matter, although they did not show progressive loss of integrity over time. Further analysis demonstrated that participants with monophasic disease experienced different post-onset trajectories in normal-appearing white matter depending on their presenting phenotype: those with acute disseminated encephalomyelitis demonstrated abnormal trajectories of diffusion parameters compared to healthy paediatric participants, as did patients with non-acute disseminated encephalomyelitis presentations associated with lesions in the brain at onset. Patients with monofocal syndromes such as optic neuritis, transverse myelitis, or isolated brainstem syndromes in whom multifocal brain lesions were absent, showed trajectories more closely approximating normal-appearing white matter development. Our findings also suggest the existence of sexual dimorphism in the effects of demyelinating syndromes on normal-appearing white matter development. Overall, we demonstrate failure of white matter maturational changes and progressive loss of white matter integrity in paediatric-onset multiple sclerosis, but also show that even a single demyelinating attack-when associated with white matter lesions in the brain-negatively impacts subsequent normal-appearing white matter development.

J	Diaz, M; Ferrer, MA; Eskander, GS; Sabourin, R				Diaz, Moises; Ferrer, Miguel A.; Eskander, George S.; Sabourin, Robert			Generation of Duplicated Off-Line Signature Images for Verification Systems	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Biometric signature identification; signature synthesis; off-line signature verification; performance evaluation; off-line signature recognition; equivalence theory	MOTOR CONTROL; IDENTIFICATION; RECOGNITION; PARAMETERS; MECHANISMS; RECOVERY	Biometric researchers have historically seen signature duplication as a procedure relevant to improving the performance of automatic signature verifiers. Different approaches have been proposed to duplicate dynamic signatures based on the heuristic affine transformation, nonlinear distortion and the kinematic model of the motor system. The literature on static signature duplication is limited and as far as we know based on heuristic affine transforms and does not seem to consider the recent advances in human behavior modeling of neuroscience. This paper tries to fill this gap by proposing a cognitive inspired algorithm to duplicate off-line signatures. The algorithm is based on a set of nonlinear and linear transformations which simulate the human spatial cognitive map and motor system intra-personal variability during the signing process. The duplicator is evaluated by increasing artificially a training sequence and verifying that the performance of four state-of-the-art off-line signature classifiers using two publicly databases have been improved on average as if we had collected three more real signatures.

Using the Quebec Longitudinal Study birth cohort, we examine prospective associations between early childhood smoke exposure and later antisocial behavior. Parents of 1035 children reported on the presence of household smokers at seven follow-ups from ages 1.5 to 7.5. At age 12, children self-reported on five aspects of early antisocial dispositions. After adjusting for confounders, every standard deviation increase in household smoke exposure was prospectively associated with a 19% standard deviation unit increase in conduct problems (=0.07; 95% confidence interval [CI] from 0.04 to 0.09), a 11% standard deviation unit increase in proactive aggression (=0.04; 95% CI from 0.01 to 0.07), a 13% standard deviation unit increase in reactive aggression (=0.07; 95% CI from 0.03 to 0.12), a 14% standard deviation unit increase in school indiscipline (=0.13; 95% CI from 0.05 to 0.20), and a 10% standard deviation unit increase in dropout risk (=0.07; 95% CI from 0.01 to 0.12). These long-term findings warrant fostering parental awareness of developmental risks by policy-makers/health practitioners. School curricula can equally integrate these ideas into their curriculum.

We sought to determine the relationship between elevated outdoor temperatures during neurogenesis and risk of neural tube defects. Methods We carried out a retrospective cohort study of 887 710 fetuses between 3 and 4 weeks postconception from the months of April through September for 1988-2012 in Quebec, Canada. The exposure was maximum daily temperature and the outcome presence of neural tube defects at delivery. We estimated prevalence ratios (PR) and 95% CIs for the association between maximum temperature and neural tube defects in log-binomial regression models adjusted for maternal characteristics. Results Relative to 20 degrees C, exposure to temperatures of 30 degrees C was associated with risk of neural tube defects on day 5 (PR 1.56, 95% CI 1.04 to 2.35) and day 6 (PR 1.49, 95% CI 1.00 to 2.21) of the 4th week postconception, during the time of neural tube closure. The trend was apparent for spina bifida and anencephalus/encephalocoele, the main subtypes of neural tube defects. Temperature during the 3rd week postconception was not associated with neural tube defects. Conclusions Elevated ambient temperatures may be weakly associated with risk of neural tube defects during tube closure.

This reflux is often associated with direct/traumatic CCF and the high-flow of the fistula alone explains the reflux. For indirect CCF, the pathophysiology of a CVR is unclear. All patients treated endovascularly for an indirect CCF with a cortical venous reflux between 2003 and 2015 were included. We retrospectively analysed data focusing on whether venous outflows of the cavernous sinus would opacify or not with the local injection of contrast, in order to locate those that could explain the venous reflux. Twenty consecutive patients (male/female ratio, 2/3) were included in this series with a mean age of 63 years. All patients presented ocular signs and no patients showed any neurological sign secondary to the CVR. We distinguished four patterns of CVR: in the superficial middle cerebral vein (75%), in the uncal vein (15%), in the superior petrosal vein (5%) and in the inferior petrosal vein (5%). Seventy percent of the cases presented a lack of opacification in more than three venous outflows of the CS involved. Each patient received an endovascular therapy by venous approach with a success rate of 76.9% per embolisation session. Two patients (10%) presented a permanent ocular paresis and two others a transient deficit. CVR is directly correlated with the thrombosis of multiple venous outflows of the CS. The "non-opacification" of at least three of the CS venous outflows is necessary for the development of CVR. Such thrombosis may be explained by the combination of haemodynamic and inflammatory changes of the venous wall.

Recognition of peroneal intraneural ganglia in an historical cohort with "negative" MRIs	ACTA NEUROCHIRURGICA			English	Article						Peroneal neuropathy; Intraneural ganglion cyst; Superior tibiofibular joint; Articular branch; Common peroneal nerve	FIBULAR NEUROPATHY; NERVE	The objective of this study was to review an historical cohort of patients with peroneal neuropathy and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) read as negative for mass or cyst to determine if occult peroneal intraneural ganglion cysts can be identified on subsequent imaging review and to use this as an estimation of how under-recognized this pathologic entity is. The patient cohort utilized in this study was a previously published control cohort of 11 patients with peroneal neuropathy and MRI read as negative for mass or cyst. Clinical history, neurologic examination, and MRI studies of the knee were reviewed for each of the included patients. The primary outcome of interest was the presence of peroneal intraneural ganglion cyst on MRI. Overall, 7 of 11 (64%) patients in this historical "normal" cohort had evidence of a peroneal intraneural ganglion cyst on subsequent review of imaging. Deep peroneal-predominant weakness, knee pain, and tibialis anterior-predominant denervation/atrophy were seen more commonly in patients in whom an intraneural cyst was identified. This retrospective cohort study provides evidence that peroneal intraneural ganglion cysts are an historically under-recognized cause of peroneal neuropathy, with 64% of this historical "negative" cohort having evidence of a cyst on subsequent imaging review. Larger studies are needed to determine the treatment ramifications of identifying small cysts and to determine the clinical features suggestive of an intraneural ganglion cyst.

The goal of this event-related brain potentials (ERPs) study was to track the neural activity associated with the violation of expectations about hostile versus nonhostile intentions in aggressive and nonaggressive individuals and examine how this neural activity relates to self-reported hostile attributional bias and impulsive aggression in real life. To this end, scenarios with a hostile versus nonhostile social context followed by a character's ambiguous aversive behavior were presented to readers, and ERPs to critical words that specified the hostile versus nonhostile intent behind the behavior were analysed. Thirty-seven aggressive and fifty nonaggressive individuals participated in the study. The presentation of a critical word that violated hostile expectation caused an N400 response that was significantly larger in aggressive than nonaggressive individuals. Results also showed an enhanced late positive potential-like component in aggressive individuals when hostile intention scenarios took place in a nonhostile context, which is associated with impulsive aggression in real life even after having controlled for the effect of self-reported hostile attributional bias. The Hostile Expectancy Violation paradigm evaluated in this study represents a promising tool to investigate the relationship between the online processing of hostile intent in others and impulsive aggression.

In this study we investigated the role of MYSM1 in T-cell development. Using mouse models that allow conditional Mysm1 ablation at late stages of thymic development, we found that MYSM1 is intricately involved in the maintenance, activation and survival of CD8(+) T cells. Mysm1 ablation resulted in a twofold reduction in CD8(+) T-cell numbers, and also led to a hyperactivated CD8(+) T-cell state accompanied by impaired proliferation and increased pro-inflammatory cytokine production after ex vivo stimulation. These phenotypes coincided with an increased apoptosis and preferential up-regulation of p53 tumour suppressor protein in CD8(+) T cells. Lastly, we examined a model of experimental cerebral malaria, in which pathology is critically dependent on CD8(+) T cells. In the mice conditionally deleted for Mysm1 in the T-cell compartment, CD8(+) T-cell numbers remained reduced following infection, both in the periphery and in the brain, and the mice displayed improved survival after parasite challenge. Collectively, our data identify MYSM1 as a novel factor for CD8(+) T cells in the immune system, increasing our understanding of the role of histone H2A deubiquitinases in cytotoxic T-cell biology.

In this study, a granular computing (GC) model was explored for the first time to overcome problems in accurately estimating K-x. Because GC is a black-box model that is not user friendly, an appropriate nonlinear regression (NLR) method was also applied to precisely predict K-x. The inclusion of the generally ignored parameter of river curvature in K-x estimation significantly improved NLR model performance. In so doing, both GC and NLR model estimations of K-x achieved high linear coefficients of determination (R-2) and small error indices [root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE)] with respect to measured Kx values. The same analysis showed that the GC model (with R-2, RMSE, and MAE values equal to 0.997, 8.11, and 2.18, respectively), outperformed the NLR model, particularly for extreme high values of K-x. Similarly to previous studies, it was also found that the most effective parameters on K-x were the channel aspect ratio, friction term, and river curvature, respectively, in descending order of importance. Moreover, a comparison between some well-known K-x models and the developed GC and NLR alternative presented here showed the latter to have outperformed the former, indicating that the GC and NLR models are a good choice for K-x prediction.

Transglutaminase 2 overexpression induces depressive-like behavior and impaired TrkB signaling in mice	MOLECULAR PSYCHIATRY			English	Article							FORCED SWIM TEST; NF-KAPPA-B; ANTIDEPRESSANT TREATMENTS; ANIMAL-MODEL; ACTIVATION; SEROTONIN; NEUROTROPHINS; NEUROGENESIS; CHOLESTEROL; PLASTICITY	Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) are two signaling molecules that have important regulatory roles in the development and plasticity of neural circuits that are known to be altered in depression. However, the mechanism by which 5-HT regulates BDNF signaling is unknown. In the present study, we found that 5-HT treatment increases BDNF receptor, TrkB (tropomyosin related kinase B), levels in mouse primary cortical neurons via a Rac1 (RAS-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent mechanism. Significant increases in the levels of type-2 transglutaminase (TG2, which is implicated in transamidation of 5-HT to Rac1) are observed in the mouse prefrontal cortex (PFC) following chronic exposure to stress. We also found that TG2 levels are increased in the post-mortem PFC of depressed suicide subjects relative to matched controls. Moreover, in mice, neuronal overexpression of TG2 resulted in the atrophy of neurons and reduced levels of TrkB in the PFC as well as a depressive-like phenotype. Overexpression of TG2 in mouse cortical neurons reduced TrkB levels as a result of impaired endocytosis of TrkB. TG2 inhibition by either a viral particle or pharmacological approach attenuated behavioral deficits caused by chronic unpredictable stress. Moreover, the overexpression of TrkB in the mouse PFC ameliorated the depressive-like phenotype of TG2-overexpressed mice. Taken together, these post-mortem and preclinical findings identify TG2 as a critical mediator of the altered TrkB expression and depressive-like behaviors associated with chronic exposure to stress and suggest that TG2 may represent a novel therapeutic target in depression.

J	Labonte-Lemoyne, E; Curnier, D; Ellemberg, D				Labonte-Lemoyne, Elise; Curnier, Daniel; Ellemberg, Dave			Exercise during pregnancy enhances cerebral maturation in the newborn: A randomized controlled trial	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL NEUROPSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						Development; Electroencephalography; Event-related potential; Exercise; Newborn; Pregnancy	MISMATCH RESPONSES; PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY; EARLY INFANCY; BRAIN; WOMEN; NEGATIVITY; MEMORY	Accumulating research indicates that the regular practice of physical exercise is beneficial to the human brain. From the improvement of academic achievement in children to the prevention of Alzheimer's disease in the elderly, exercise appears beneficial across the developmental spectrum. Recent work from animal studies also indicates that a pregnant mother can transfer the benefits of exercise during gestation to her offspring's brain. Exercising pregnant rats give birth to pups that have better memory and spatial learning as well as increased synaptic density. To investigate whether this transfer from the pregnant mother to her child also occurs in humans, we conducted a randomized controlled trial (n=18) and measured the impact of exercise during pregnancy on the neuroelectric response of the neonatal brain with electroencephalography (EEG). Here we show that, compared to the newborns of mothers who were inactive during their pregnancy, the children of exercising pregnant women are born with more mature brains. This was measured with the infant slow positive mismatch response (SPMMR), an electroencephalographic potential known to decrease in amplitude with age. The SPMMR reflects processes associated with brain maturation via its response to sound discrimination and auditory memory. In this study, the children of the mothers who exercised throughout their pregnancy have a smaller SPMMR than the children of mothers who remained sedentary (p=.019). Our results demonstrate the impact regular exercise during pregnancy can have on the development of the human fetal brain.

Mu Opioid Receptors in Gamma-Aminobutyric Acidergic Forebrain Neurons Moderate Motivation for Heroin and Palatable Food	BIOLOGICAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						Conditional gene knockout; Dopamine; Motivation; Mu opioid receptor; Opiate; Reward	VENTRAL TEGMENTAL AREA; NUCLEUS-ACCUMBENS SHELL; MORPHINE-INDUCED CATALEPSY; BRAIN REWARD CIRCUITRY; KNOCKOUT MICE; INDUCED ANALGESIA; DOPAMINE NEURONS; DEFICIENT MICE; IN-VIVO; GENE	BACKGROUND: Mu opioid receptors (MORs) are central to pain control, drug reward, and addictive behaviors, but underlying circuit mechanisms have been poorly explored by genetic approaches. Here we investigate the contribution of MORs expressed in gamma-aminobutyric acidergic forebrain neurons to major biological effects of opiates, and also challenge the canonical disinhibition model of opiate reward. METHODS: We used Dlx5/6-mediated recombination to create conditional Oprm1 mice in gamma-aminobutyric acidergic forebrain neurons. We characterized the genetic deletion by histology, electrophysiology, and microdialysis; probed neuronal activation by c-Fos immunohistochemistry and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging; and investigated main behavioral responses to opiates, including motivation to obtain heroin and palatable food. RESULTS: Mutant mice showed MOR transcript deletion mainly in the striatum. In the ventral tegmental area, local MOR activity was intact, and reduced activity was only observed at the level of striatonigral afferents. Heroin-induced neuronal activation was modified at both sites, and whole-brain functional networks were altered in live animals. Morphine analgesia was not altered, and neither was physical dependence to chronic morphine. In contrast, locomotor effects of heroin were abolished, and heroin-induced catalepsy was increased. Place preference to heroin was not modified, but remarkably, motivation to obtain heroin and palatable food was enhanced in operant selfadministration procedures. CONCLUSIONS: Our study reveals dissociable MOR functions across mesocorticolimbic networks. Thus, beyond a well-established role in reward processing, operating at the level of local ventral tegmental area neurons, MORs also moderate motivation for appetitive stimuli within forebrain circuits that drive motivated behaviors.

Here, we aimed at investigating the relative independence of these associations in a large sample of patients. Two samples of males and females totaling 209 euthymic participants were recruited, including 72 patients with a major depressive disorder, 64 with bipolar disorders and 73 healthy controls. Among patients, 61 had a lifetime history of suicide attempt and 75 had none. Structural scans were acquired with 1.5 T magnetic resonance imaging. Surface-based morphometry (Freesurfer) analysis was used to compute the volumes of the CC. In the whole sample, there was a significant reduction in the volume of mid-anterior, central, and mid-posterior (all p < 0.008) CC in bipolar patients independently from suicidality, with medium effect sizes between unipolar and bipolar patients (Cohen's d between 0.46 and 0.62). In contrast, suicide attempters did not differ from non-attempters. This significant association between CC volumes and bipolar disorders was mainly found in the male sample, while a trend was found in the female sample. Within each patient group, medication had no major effect. Our study adds to the growing body of evidence linking corpus callosum alterations and bipolar disorders.

We aimed to describe the early hemodynamic management of trauma patients outside densely populated urban centers. Methods We conducted a single-center retrospective cohort study in a Canadian regional trauma center. All adult patients treated for traumatic injury in 2013 who died within 24 hours of admission or were transferred to the intensive care unit were included. A systolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg, a mean arterial pressure < 60 mmHg, the use of vasopressors or >= 2 L of intravenous fluids defined hemodynamic instability. Main outcome measures were use of intravenous fluids and vasopressors prior to surgical or endovascular management. Results Of 111 eligible patients, 63 met our criteria for hemodynamic instability. Of these, 60 (95%) had sustained blunt injury and 22 (35%) had concomitant severe traumatic brain injury. The subgroup of patients referred from a primary or secondary hospital (20 of 63, 32%) had significantly longer transport times (243 vs. 61 min, p < 0.01). Vasopressors, used in 26 patients (41%), were independently associated with severe traumatic brain injury (odds ratio 10.2, 95% CI 2.7-38.5). Conclusions In this cohort, most trauma patients had suffered multiple blunt injuries. Patients were likely to receive vasopressors during the early phase of trauma care, particularly if they exhibited signs of neurologic injury. While these results may be context-specific, determining the risk-benefit trade-offs of fluid resuscitation, vasopressors and permissive hypotension in specific patients subgroups constitutes a priority for trauma research going forwards.

Results: Using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), we examined heart development in mouse embryos with zygotic and cardiac specific deletion of Pcsk5. We show that conditional deletion of Pcsk5 in all epiblastic lineages recapitulates all developmental malformations except for tracheo-esophageal malformations. Using a conditional deletion strategy, we find that there is an essential and specific requirement for Pcsk5 in the cranio-cardiac mesoderm for cardiogenesis, but not for conotruncal septation or any other aspect of embryonic development. Surprisingly, deletion of Pcsk5 in cardiogenic or pharyngeal mesodermal progenitors that form later from the cranio-cardiac mesoderm does not affect heart development. Neither is Pcsk5 essential in the neural crest, which drives conotruncal septation. Conclusions: Our results suggest that Pcsk5 may have an essential and early role in the cranio-cardiac mesoderm for heart development. Alternatively, it is possible that Pcsk5 may still play a critical role in Nkx2.5 expressing cardiac progenitors, with persistence of mRNA or protein accounting for the lack of effect of deletion on heart development.

Influences of prenatal and postnatal maternal depression on amygdala volume and microstructure in young children	TRANSLATIONAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Article							MOTHER-INFANT INTERACTIONS; BRAIN-DEVELOPMENT; MAJOR DEPRESSION; SEX-DIFFERENCES; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; PARENTING BEHAVIOR; LARGER AMYGDALA; STRESS; HIPPOCAMPAL; PREGNANCY	Maternal depressive symptoms influence neurodevelopment in the offspring. Such effects may appear to be gender-dependent. The present study examined contributions of prenatal and postnatal maternal depressive symptoms to the volume and microstructure of the amygdala in 4.5-year-old boys and girls. Prenatal maternal depressive symptoms were measured using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) at 26 weeks of gestation. Postnatal maternal depression was assessed at 3 months using the EPDS and at 1, 2, 3 and 4.5 years using the Beck's Depression Inventory-II. Structural magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion tensor imaging were performed with 4.5-year-old children to extract the volume and fractional anisotropy (FA) values of the amygdala. Our results showed that greater prenatal maternal depressive symptoms were associated with larger right amygdala volume in girls, but not in boys. Increased postnatal maternal depressive symptoms were associated with higher right amygdala FA in the overall sample and girls, but not in boys. These results support the role of variation in right amygdala structure in transmission of maternal depression to the offspring, particularly to girls. The differential effects of prenatal and postnatal maternal depressive symptoms on the volume and FA of the right amygdala suggest the importance of the timing of exposure to maternal depressive symptoms in brain development of girls. This further underscores the need for intervention targeting both prenatal and postnatal maternal depression to girls in preventing adverse child outcomes.	[Wen, D. J.; Ni, S.

However, requiring light sources to be turned off during intraoperative spectral acquisition can be impractical because it can slow down the procedure by requiring surgeons to acquire data under light conditions different from the routine clinical practice. Here a filter system is introduced allowing in vivo Raman spectroscopy measurements to be performed with the light source of a neurosurgical microscope turned on, without interfering with the standard procedure. Ex vivo and in vivo results on calf and human brain, respectively, show that when the new filter system is used there is no significant difference between Raman spectra acquired under pitch dark conditions or with the microscope light source turned on. This is important for the clinical translation of Raman spectroscopy because of the resulting decrease in total imaging time for each measurement and because the surgeon can now acquire spectroscopic data with no disruption of the surgical workflow.

Participants underwent both a standardized psychosocial laboratory stressor (TSST-G) and a control condition. Then, they performed a homemade version of the facial expressions megamix. All six basic emotions were included in the task. First, our results show a systematic increase in the intensity threshold for disgust following stress, meaning that the participants' performance with this emotion was impaired. We suggest that this may reflect an adaptive coping mechanism where participants attempt to decrease their anxiety and protect themselves from a socio-evaluative threat. Second, our results show a systematic decrease in the intensity threshold for surprise, therefore positively affecting the participants' performance with that emotion. We suggest that the enhanced perception of surprise following the induction of social stress may be interpreted as an evolutionary adaptation, wherein being in a stressful environment increases the benefits of monitoring signals indicating the presence of a novel or threatening event. An alternative explanation may derive from the opposite nature of the facial expressions of disgust and surprise; the decreased recognition of disgust could therefore have fostered the propensity to perceive surprise.

Regularly spaced oscillations that mainly presented at theta frequency range (5-12 Hz) occurred synchronously in all three structures in the presence of carbachol. These oscillations, which disappeared when slices were perfused with pirenzepine or with glutamatergic receptor antagonists, were categorized as short (<4 s) and long (>4 s) with short events oscillating at higher frequencies than long events. Field oscillations were highly synchronized between regions and latency analysis revealed that they often initiated in the entorhinal cortex later than in the other two structures. Blocking GABA(A) receptors modified the activity patterns of both short and long oscillations and decreased their coherence in the theta frequency range. Finally, blocking KCC2 activity disclosed a pattern of recurrent short oscillations. Our results suggest that in the presence of carbachol both subiculum and CA3 most often drive theta generators in the entorhinal cortex and that these oscillations are influenced but not abolished by altering GABAA receptor signaling.

PLOS ONE			English	Editorial Material							ELDERLY-PEOPLE; ROTTERDAM SCAN; LESIONS; STROKE; LEUKOARAIOSIS; POPULATION; PREDICTOR; DECLINE; RISK	Objective We performed this study to assess the effect of an antiplatelet agent on the progression of white matter hyperintensities (WMH). Methods From August 2003 to May 2005, we consecutively enrolled patients who underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for health check-up purposes and showed no significant findings other than WMH of any degree. Patients were divided into two groups based on whether or not they received antiplatelet therapy. All patients had a follow-up brain MRI after 5 years and WMH volume change was measured using imaging analysis software. To minimize selection bias potentially arising from antiplatelet treatment assignment, analyses were inverse probability weighted. Results Among the 93 patients who met the inclusion criteria, 54 patients (58.1%) were grouped as the antiplatelet group (AG), and the remaining 39 patients (41.9%) as the non-antiplatelet group (NAG). After inverse propensity weighting, all baseline characteristics were similar between the two groups, and antiplatelet treatment did not show any significant effect on the total WMH volume change (p = 0.957). Conclusion Antiplatelet medication may not alter the progression of WMH.

Previous computational and empirical studies suggest a significant influence of brain network structure on brain network function. However, there have been few analytical approaches to explain the role of network structure in shaping regional activities and directionality patterns. In this study, analytical methods are applied to a coupled oscillator model implemented in inhomogeneous networks. We first derive a mathematical principle that explains the emergence of directionality from the underlying brain network structure. We then apply the analytical methods to the anatomical brain networks of human, macaque, and mouse, successfully predicting simulation and empirical electroencephalographic data. The results demonstrate that the global directionality patterns in resting state brain networks can be predicted solely by their unique network structures. This study forms a foundation for a more comprehensive understanding of how neural information is directed and integrated in complex brain networks.

However, up to this point, there has been no direct evidence to support this assertion in humans, and the physiological processes supporting such reactivation are unknown. Here, simultaneous electroencephalographic and functional magnetic resonance imaging (EEG-fMRI) recordings were conducted during post-learning sleep to directly investigate the spindle-related reactivation of a memory trace formed during motor sequence learning (MSL), and its relationship to overnight enhancement in performance (reflecting consolidation). We show that brain regions within the striato-cerebello-cortical network recruited during training on the MSL task, and in particular the striatum, were also activated during sleep, time-locked to spindles. Interestingly, the consolidated trace in the striatum was not simply strengthened, but was transformed/reorganized from rostrodorsal (associative) to caudoventral (sensorimotor) subregions. Moreover, the degree of the reactivation was correlated with overnight improvements in performance. Altogether, the present findings demonstrate that striatal reactivation linked to sleep spindles in the post-learning night, is related to motor memory consolidation.

Determining the pattern of clock gene expression across neuronal subpopulations is a key step in understanding their regulation and how they may influence the functions of various brain structures. Using immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy, we quantified the c-oexpression of the clock proteins BMAL1 and PER2 with two neuropeptides, Substance P (SubP) and Enkephalin (Enk), expressed in distinct neuronal populations throughout the forebrain. Regions examined included the limbic forebrain (dorsal striatum, nucleus accumbens, amygdala, stria terminalis), thalamus medial habenula of the thalamus, paraventricular nucleus and arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus and the olfactory bulb. In most regions examined, BMAL1 was homogeneously expressed in nearly all neurons (similar to 90%), and PER2 was expressed in a slightly lower proportion of cells. There was no specific correlation to SubP- or Enk- expressing subpopulations. The olfactory bulb was unique in that PER2 and BMAL1 were expressed in a much smaller percentage of cells, and Enk was rarely found in the same cells that expressed the clock proteins (SubP was undetectable). These results indicate that clock genes are not unique to specific cell types, and further studies will be required to determine the factors that contribute to the regulation of clock gene expression throughout the brain.

Here, we report that human microglial-like cells (iMGLs) can be differentiated from iPSCs to study their function in neurological diseases, like Alzheimer's disease (AD). We find that iMGLs develop in vitro similarly to microglia in vivo, and whole-transcriptome analysis demonstrates that they are highly similar to cultured adult and fetal human microglia. Functional assessment of iMGLs reveals that they secrete cytokines in response to inflammatory stimuli, migrate and undergo calcium transients, and robustly phagocytose CNS substrates. iMGLs were used to examine the effects of Ab fibrils and brain-derived tau oligomers on AD-related gene expression and to interrogate mechanisms involved in synaptic pruning. Furthermore, iMGLs transplanted into transgenic mice and human brain organoids resemble microglia in vivo. Together, these findings demonstrate that iMGLs can be used to study microglial function, providing important new insight into human neurological disease.

Neurons Export Extracellular Vesicles Enriched in Cysteine String Protein and Misfolded Protein Cargo	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							AMYOTROPHIC-LATERAL-SCLEROSIS; HEAT-SHOCK PROTEINS; CSP-ALPHA; CEROID-LIPOFUSCINOSIS; SUPEROXIDE-DISMUTASE; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; CALCIUM-CHANNELS; INDEPENDENT MECHANISMS; TERMINAL FRAGMENTS; MUTANT HUNTINGTIN	The fidelity of synaptic transmission depends on the integrity of the protein machinery at the synapse. Unfolded synaptic proteins undergo refolding or degradation in order to maintain synaptic proteostasis and preserve synaptic function, and buildup of unfolded/toxic proteins leads to neuronal dysfunction. Many molecular chaperones contribute to proteostasis, but one in particular, cysteine string protein (CSP alpha), is critical for proteostasis at the synapse. In this study we report that exported vesicles from neurons contain CSP alpha. Extracellular vesicles (EV's) have been implicated in a wide range of functions. However, the functional significance of neural EV's remains to be established. Here we demonstrate that co-expression of CSP alpha with the disease-associated proteins, polyglutamine expanded protein 72Q huntingtin(exon1) or superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD-1(G93A)) leads to the cellular export of both 72Q huntingtin(exon1) and SOD-1(G93A) via EV's. In contrast, the inactive CSP alpha(HPD-AAA) mutant does not facilitate elimination of misfolded proteins. Furthermore, CSP alpha-mediated export of 72Q huntingtin(exon1) is reduced by the polyphenol, resveratrol. Our results indicate that by assisting local lysosome/proteasome processes, CSP alpha-mediated removal of toxic proteins via EVs plays a central role in synaptic proteostasis and CSP alpha thus represents a potential therapeutic target for neurodegenerative diseases.

However, the functional impact of habenular cholinergic signaling on the specified depressive behaviors is not well understood. Here, we demonstrated that the expression levels of cholinergic signaling genes (CHAT, VACHT, CHT, CHRNA3, CHRNB3 and CHRNB4) were down-regulated in a chronic restraint stress (CRS) rat model of depression, in which rats display depression-like behaviors such as anhedonia and mood despair. Moreover, knockdown of CHAT in the rat habenula was sufficient to evoke anhedonia-like behavior. The anhedonia-like behavior induced by CHAT knockdown was not reversed by chronic administration of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine. To determine whether habenular cholinergic signaling is associated with regulation of dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and serotonin neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN), we used CHAT::cre transgenic mice expressing the Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADD). Pharmacogenetic activation of habenular cholinergic neurons induces the excitation of dopamine neurons in the VTA and reduces the immunoreactivity of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) in the DRN. Habenular cholinergic gene down-regulation was recapitulated in the postmortem habenula of suicide victims diagnosed with major depressive disorder (MDD).

Gestational and Lactational Exposure to an Environmentally-Relevant Mixture of Brominated Flame Retardants: Effects on Neurodevelopment and Metabolism	BIRTH DEFECTS RESEARCH			English	Article						brominated flame retardants; glucose tolerance; hexabromocyclododecane; neurodevelopment; polybrominated diphenyl ethers	POLYBROMINATED DIPHENYL ETHERS; NEONATAL BRAIN-DEVELOPMENT; SPRAGUE-DAWLEY RATS; HOUSE-DUST; DEVELOPMENTAL EXPOSURE; PERINATAL EXPOSURE; NEUROBEHAVIORAL DEVELOPMENT; POSTNATAL EXPOSURE; WISTAR RATS; ADULT MICE	Background: Developmental exposure to brominated flame retardants (BFRs), including polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and hexabromocyclododecane (HBCDD), has been associated with impaired neurodevelopment and some symptoms of metabolic syndrome. However, there are inconsistencies in studies reporting neurodevelopmental effects with studies of pure substances more likely to report effects than studies of technical products. In addition, the influence of early BFR exposures on later development of metabolic disease-like symptoms has not been investigated. This study examined the effects of perinatal exposure to an environmentally relevant mixture of BFRs based on relative levels observed in house dust, on several markers of neurodevelopment and metabolism in offspring. Methods: Sprague-Dawley female rats were fed a diet estimated to deliver daily doses of 0, 0.06, 20, or 60 mg/kg of a mixture of PBDEs and HBCDD from before mating to weaning. Offspring were weaned to control diet and subjected to neurobehavioral and metabolic assessments. Results: Exposure to BFRs decreased vertical movement in at postnatal day (PND) 32 and increased time to emerge to a lighted area on PND 105 in offspring of both sexes. Although early life exposure to the BFR mixture did not impact measures of glucose or insulin action, male offspring had significantly decreased fat pad weights at PND 46. Total cholesterol was increased in male and female offspring exposed to the highest dose at PND 21. Conclusions: These results suggest that gestational and lactational exposure to an environmentally relevant BFR mixture may induce changes in neurodevelopment and lipid metabolism in offspring.

Moreover, a high degree of structural and functional heterogeneity in Broca's region has been reported in many studies. This raised the issue of how the intrinsic organization of Broca's region effects by different language experiences in light of its subdivisions. To address this question, we used multicenter resting-state fMRI data to explore the cross-cultural consistency and diversity of Broca's region in terms of its subdivisions, connectivity patterns and modularity organization in Chinese and German speakers. A consistent topological organization of the 13 subdivisions within the extended Broca's region was revealed on the basis of a new in-vivo parcellation map, which corresponded well to the previously reported receptor architectonic map. Based on this parcellation map, consistent functional connectivity patterns and modularity organization of these subdivisions were found. Some cultural difference in the functional connectivity patterns was also found, for instance stronger connectivity in Chinese subjects between area 6v2 and the motor hand area, as well as higher correlations between area 45p and middle frontal gyrus. Our study suggests that a generally invariant organization of Broca's region, together with certain regulations of different language experiences on functional connectivity, might exists to support language processing in human brain.

The statistics of the vestibular input experienced during natural self-motion differ between rodents and primates	JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY-LONDON			English	Article							HORIZONTAL VESTIBULOOCULAR REFLEX; SOFT-TISSUE RESONANCE; BRAIN-STEM NEURONS; HEAD STABILIZATION; INFORMATION-TRANSMISSION; VOLUNTARY CANCELLATION; HUMAN DISCRIMINATION; NERVE AFFERENTS; FIRING BEHAVIOR; MOUSE MODEL	It is widely believed that sensory systems are adapted to the statistical structure of natural stimuli, thereby optimizing coding. Recent evidence suggests that this is also the case for the vestibular system, which senses self-motion and in turn contributes to essential brain functions ranging fromthe most automatic reflexes to spatial perception andmotor coordination. However, little is known about the statistics of self-motion stimuli actually experienced by freely moving animals in their natural environments. Accordingly, here we examined the natural self-motion signals experienced by mice and monkeys: two species commonly used to study vestibular neural coding. First, we found that probability distributions for all six dimensions of motion (three rotations, three translations) in both species deviated from normality due to long tails. Interestingly, the power spectra of natural rotational stimuli displayed similar structure for both species and were not well fitted by power laws. This result contrasts with reports that the natural spectra of other sensory modalities (i.e. vision, auditory and tactile) instead show a power-law relationship with frequency, which indicates scale invariance. Analysis of natural translational stimuli revealed important species differences as power spectra deviated from scale invariance for monkeys but not for mice. By comparing our results to previously published data for humans, we found the statistical structure of natural self-motion stimuli in monkeys and humans more closely resemble one another. Our results thus predict that, overall, neural coding strategies used by vestibular pathways to encode natural self-motion stimuli are fundamentally different in rodents and primates.

Structural brain changes may provide clues about the underlying pathophysiology. This study provides a detailed spatial characterization of the pattern and extent of brain volume changes associated with HIV and relates these brain measures to cognitive ability and clinical variables. Methods: Multiple novel neuroimaging techniques (deformation based morphometry, voxel-based morphometry, and cortical modeling) were used to assess regional brain volumes in 125 HIV-infected patients and 62 HIV-uninfected individuals. Ninety percent of the HIV-infected patients were on stable HAART with most of them (75%) having plasma viral suppression. Brain volumetrics and cortical thickness estimates were compared between the HIV infected and uninfected groups, and the relationships between these measures of brain volume and indices of current and past infection severity, central nervous system penetration of HAART, and cognitive performance were assessed. Results: Regionally specific patterns of reduced thalamic and brainstem volumes and reduced cortical thickness in the orbitofrontal cortex, cingulate gyrus, primary motor and sensory cortex, temporal, and frontal lobes were seen in HIV-infected patients compared to HIV-uninfected participants. Observed white matter loss and subcortical atrophy were associated with lower nadir CD4 cell counts, while reduction in cortical thickness was related to worse cognitive performance. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that distinct mechanisms may underlie cortical and subcortical injury in people with HIV and argues for the potential importance of early initiation of HAART to protect long-term brain health.

ATLAS collaboration	Measurement of the inclusive cross-sections of single top-quark and top-antiquark t-channel production in pp collisions at root s=13 TeV with the ATLAS detector	JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS			English	Article						Hadron-Hadron scattering (experiments)	PARTON DISTRIBUTIONS; HADRON COLLIDERS; PLUS PLUS; LHC; PACKAGE	A measurement of the t-channel single-top-quark and single-top-antiquark production cross-sections in the lepton+jets channel is presented, using 3.2 fb(-1) of proton-proton collision data at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV, recorded with the ATLAS detector at the LHC in 2015. Events are selected by requiring one charged lepton (electron or muon), missing transverse momentum, and two jets with high transverse momentum, exactly one of which is required to be b-tagged. Using a binned maximum-likelihood fit to the discriminant distribution of a neural network, the cross-sections are determined to be sigma(tq) = 156 +/- 5 (stat.) +/- 27 (syst.) +/- 3 (lumi.) pb for single top-quark production and sigma((t) over barq) = 91 +/- 4 (stat.) +/- 18 (syst.) +/- 2 (lumi.) pb for single top-antiquark production, assuming a top-quark mass of 172.5 GeV. The cross-section ratio is measured to be R-t = sigma(tq) / sigma((t) over barq) = 1.72 +/- 0.09 (stat.) +/- 0.18 (syst.). All results are in agreement with Standard Model predictions.

POLR3A encodes the largest subunit of RNA Polymerase III (Pol III), which is responsible for the transcription of transfer RNAs (tRNAs) and a large array of other small non-coding RNAs. In order to study the central nervous system pathophysiology of the disease, we introduced the French Canadian founder Polr3a mutation c.2015G> A (p.G672E) in mice, generating homozygous knock-in (KI/KI) as well as compound heterozygous mice for one Polr3a KI and one null allele (KI/KO). Both KI/KI and KI/KO mice are viable and are able to reproduce. To establish if they manifest a motor phenotype, WT, KI/KI and KI/KO mice were submitted to a battery of behavioral tests over one year. The KI/KI and KI/KO mice have overall normal balance, muscle strength and general locomotion. Cerebral and cerebellar Luxol Fast Blue staining and measurement of levels of myelin proteins showed no significant differences between the three groups, suggesting that myelination is not overtly impaired in Polr3a KI/KI and KI/KO mice. Finally, expression levels of several Pol III transcripts in the brain showed no statistically significant differences. We conclude that the first transgenic mice with a leukodystrophy-causing Polr3a mutation do not recapitulate the childhood-onset HLD observed in the majority of human patients with POLR3A mutations, and provide essential information to guide selection of Polr3a mutations for developing future mouse models of the disease.

In exposed individuals, and in their descendants, adverse outcomes have been linked to such exposure, including cancers, genital malformations, and less consistently, psychiatric disorders. We aimed to explore whether prenatal DES exposure would be associated with DNA methylation changes, and whether these epigenetic modifications would be associated with increased risk of psychosis. Methods From 247 individuals born from mothers exposed to DES, we selected 69 siblings from 30 families. In each family, at least one sibling was exposed in utero to DES. We performed a methylome-wide association study using HumanMethylation450 DNA Analysis BeadChip (R) in peripheral blood. We analyzed methylation changes at individual CpGs or regions in exposed (n = 37) versus unexposed individuals (n = 32). We also compared exposed individuals with (n = 7) and without psychosis (n = 30). Results There were more individuals with schizophrenia in the DES-exposed group. We found no significant differences between exposed and unexposed individuals with respect to differentially methylated CpGs or regions. The largest difference was in a region near the promoter of an ADAMTS proteoglycanase gene (ADAMTS9). Compared to exposed individuals without psychosis, exposed individuals with psychosis had differential methylation in the region encompassing the gene encoding the zinc finger protein 57 ( ZFP57). Conclusions In utero exposure to DES was not associated with methylation changes at specific CpGs or regions. In exposed individuals, however, psychosis was associated with specific methylomic modifications that could impact neurodevelopment and neuroplasticity.

Following electrophysiological recording, 3D models were constructed from high-resolution imaging data to identify morphological features that could influence the coding of MF input patterns by adult CGCs. Quantification of MF and CGC morphology provided evidence that CGCs could be connected to the multiple rosettes that arise from a single MF input. Predictions from our computational models propose that MF inputs could be more densely encoded within the CGC layer than previous models suggest. Moreover, those MF signals arriving onto the dendrite closest to the axon will generate greater CGC excitation. However, the impact of this morphological variability on MF input selectivity will be attenuated by high levels of CGC inhibition providing further flexibility to the MF. CGC pathway. These features could be particularly important when considering the integration of multimodal MF sensory input by individual CGCs.

We identified a role for DHC-1, the C. elegans dynein heavy chain, in maintaining neuronal cargo distribution. Surprisingly, this does not involve dynein's role as a retrograde motor in cargo transport, hinging instead on its ability to inhibit microtubule (MT) dynamics. Neuronal MTs are highly static, yet the mechanisms and functional significance of this property are not well understood. In disease-mimicking dhc-1 alleles, excessive MT growth and collapse occur at the dendrite tip, resulting in the formation of aberrant MT loops. These unstable MTs act as cargo traps, leading to ectopic accumulations of cargo and reduced availability of cargo at normal locations. Our data suggest that an anchored dynein pool interacts with plus-end-out MTs to stabilize MTs and allow efficient retrograde transport. These results identify functional significance for neuronal MT stability and suggest a mechanism for cellular dysfunction in dynein-linked disease.

Methods Twenty cats were included after clinical examination, blood work and full body radiographs were performed. In Phase 1, outcome assessments aimed to differentiate normal (n = 5; i. e. exempt of any radiographic and clinical sign of OA) from OA (n = 15) cats. In Phase 2, OA cats were treated twice daily with a placebo (PG: cornstarch 15 mg) or tramadol (TG: 3 mg/kg) orally for 19 days, with a 3-month washout period between treatments. Evaluations were performed in normal and OA cats at baseline and consisted of: 1) peak vertical force (PVF) after staircase exercise; 2) telemetered night-time motor activity (NMA); and 3) response to mechanical temporal summation (RMTS). After treatment, PVF, NMA and RMTS evaluations were repeated in OA cats. Data were analysed with mixed model methods with an alpha-threshold of 5%. Results Phase 1: 1) PVF (% of body weight; mean +/- SD) was higher in normal (59 +/- 10.5) than in OA cats (50.6 +/- 5.7) (p = 0.005); 2) NMA (no unit) was not different between groups; 3) RMTS (number of stimuli; median (range)) was higher in normal [29.5 (23.5 +/- 30)] than in OA cats [14 (8.5 +/- 28)] (p < 0.0001). Phase 2: PVF, NMA and RMTS presented a treatment effect (p = 0.024, p = 0.008 and p = 0.018, respectively). No clinically important adverse-effects were observed. Conclusion Outcome assessments such as kinetics (PVF) and evaluation of central sensitisation (RMTS) are discriminant of OA status. Mobility measured by NMA was not discriminant of OA status, however it increased in OA cats with tramadol treatment. Nociceptive hypersensitivity quantified by RMTS was evident in OA cats and was responsive to tramadol treatment.

In addition, VGLUT3 is expressed in the inner hair cells of the auditory system. A mutation (p. A211V) in the gene that encodes VGLUT3 is responsible for progressive deafness in two unrelated families. In this study, we investigated the consequences of the p. A211V mutation in cell cultures and in the CNS of a mutant mouse. The mutation substantially decreased VGLUT3 expression (-70%). Wemeasured VGLUT3-p.A211V activity by vesicular uptake in BON cells, electrophysiological recording of isolated neurons, and its ability to stimulate serotonergic accumulation in cortical synaptic vesicles. Despite a marked loss of expression, the activity of the mutated isoform was only minimally altered. Furthermore, mutant mice displayed none of the behavioral alterations that have previously been reported in VGLUT3 knock-out mice. Finally, we used stimulated emission depletion microscopy to analyze how the mutation altered VGLUT3 distribution within the terminals of mice expressing the mutated isoform. The mutation appeared to reduce the expression of theVGLUT3transporter by simultaneously decreasing the number of VGLUT3-positive synaptic vesicles and the amount of VGLUT3 per synapses. These observations suggested that VGLUT3 global activity is not linearly correlated with VGLUT3 expression. Furthermore, our data unraveled a nonuniform distribution of VGLUT3 in synaptic vesicles. Identifying the mechanisms responsible for this complex vesicular sorting will be critical to understand VGLUT's involvement in normal and pathological conditions.

Plasticity within excitatory and inhibitory pathways of the vestibulo-spinal circuitry guides changes in motor performance	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							HORIZONTAL VESTIBULOOCULAR REFLEX; SEMICIRCULAR CANAL AFFERENTS; 2ND-ORDER VESTIBULAR NEURONS; MONKEY MACACA-FASCICULARIS; SELF-MOTION PERCEPTION; BRAIN-STEM NEURONS; UNILATERAL LABYRINTHECTOMY; SQUIRREL-MONKEY; ELECTRICAL-STIMULATION; MACAQUE MONKEY	Investigations of behaviors with well-characterized circuitry are required to understand how the brain learns new motor skills and ensures existing behaviors remain appropriately calibrated over time. Accordingly, here we recorded from neurons within different sites of the vestibulo-spinal circuitry of behaving macaque monkeys during temporally precise activation of vestibular afferents. Behaviorally relevant patterns of vestibular nerve activation generated a rapid and substantial decrease in the monosynaptic responses recorded at the first central stage of processing from neurons receiving direct input from vestibular afferents within minutes, as well as a decrease in the compensatory reflex response that lasted up to 8 hours. In contrast, afferent responses to this same stimulation remained constant, indicating that plasticity was not induced at the level of the periphery but rather at the afferent-central neuron synapse. Strikingly, the responses of neurons within indirect brainstem pathways also remained constant, even though the efficacy of their central input was significantly reduced. Taken together, our results show that rapid plasticity at the first central stage of vestibulospinal pathways can guide changes in motor performance, and that complementary plasticity on the same millisecond time scale within inhibitory vestibular nuclei networks contributes to ensuring a relatively robust behavioral output.

Animal models to improve our understanding and treatment of suicidal behavior	TRANSLATIONAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Review							TRAUMATIC BRAIN-INJURY; MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER; TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; CHILDHOOD SEXUAL-ABUSE; IMPAIRED DECISION-MAKING; DEFENSIVE RAGE BEHAVIOR; IMPULSIVE-AGGRESSIVE BEHAVIORS; VENTROMEDIAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; TREATMENT-RESISTANT DEPRESSION; CORTICOTROPIN-RELEASING-FACTOR	Worldwide, suicide is a leading cause of death. Although a sizable proportion of deaths by suicide may be preventable, it is well documented that despite major governmental and international investments in research, education and clinical practice suicide rates have not diminished and are even increasing among several at-risk populations. Although nonhuman animals do not engage in suicidal behavior amenable to translational studies, we argue that animal model systems are necessary to investigate candidate endophenotypes of suicidal behavior and the neurobiology underlying these endophenotypes. Animal models are similarly a critical resource to help delineate treatment targets and pharmacological means to improve our ability to manage the risk of suicide. In particular, certain pathophysiological pathways to suicidal behavior, including stress and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis dysfunction, neurotransmitter system abnormalities, endocrine and neuroimmune changes, aggression, impulsivity and decision-making deficits, as well as the role of critical interactions between genetic and epigenetic factors, development and environmental risk factors can be modeled in laboratory animals. We broadly describe human biological findings, as well as protective effects of medications such as lithium, clozapine, and ketamine associated with modifying risk of engaging in suicidal behavior that are readily translatable to animal models. Endophenotypes of suicidal behavior, studied in animal models, are further useful for moving observed associations with harmful environmental factors (for example, childhood adversity, mechanical trauma aeroallergens, pathogens, inflammation triggers) from association to causation, and developing preventative strategies. Further study in animals will contribute to a more informed, comprehensive, accelerated and ultimately impactful suicide research portfolio.	[Gould, T.

J	Hurlimann, T; Groisman, IJ; Godard, B				Hurlimann, Thierry; Groisman, Iris Jaitovich; Godard, Beatrice			The elusive ideal of inclusiveness: lessons from a worldwide survey of neurologists on the ethical issues raised by whole-genome sequencing	BMC MEDICAL ETHICS			English	Article						Research ethics; Justice; Fair inclusion; Genomics	DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES; HEALTH SYSTEMS; GLOBAL HEALTH; EPILEPSY; VIEWS; PARTICIPANTS; CHALLENGES; GENETICS; JUSTICE	The anticipation of ethical issues that may arise with the clinical use of genomic technologies is crucial to envision their future implementation in a manner sensitive to local contexts. Yet, populations in low- and middle-income countries are underrepresented in studies that aim to explore stakeholders' perspectives on the use of such technologies. Within the framework of a research project entitled "Personalized medicine in the treatment of epilepsy", we sought to increase inclusiveness by widening the reach of our survey, inviting neurologists from around the world to share their views and practices regarding the use of whole-genome sequencing in clinical neurology and its associated ethics. We discuss herein the compelling scientific and ethical reasons that led us to attempt to recruit neurologists worldwide, despite the lack, in many low- or middle-income countries, of access to genomic technologies. Recruitment procedures and their results are presented and discussed, as well as the barriers we faced. We conclude that inclusive recruitment remains a challenging, albeit necessary and legitimate, endeavour.

Here we report on a fast and reliable transfer patterning process to fabricate high-resolution metal microelectrodes on polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) by using ultrathin Parylene films (2 mu m thick). By combining transfer patterning of metal electrodes with orthogonal patterning of the conducting polymer poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) doped with polystyrenesulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) on a prestretched PDMS substrate and a biocompatible "cut and paste" hydrogel, we demonstrated a fully stretchable organic electrochemical transistor, relevant for wearable electronics, biosensors, and surface electrodes to monitor body conditions.

Electrosensory neural responses to natural electro-communication stimuli are distributed along a continuum	PLOS ONE			English	Article							LATERAL-LINE LOBE; RECEPTIVE-FIELD ORGANIZATION; INTERNEURON-DIVERSITY-SERIES; CA1 PYRAMIDAL NEURONS; APTERONOTUS-LEPTORHYNCHUS; DENDRITIC MORPHOLOGY; RAT HIPPOCAMPUS; GAIN-CONTROL; CELL-TYPES; FISH	Neural heterogeneities are seen ubiquitously within the brain and greatly complicate classification efforts. Here we tested whether the responses of an anatomically well-characterized sensory neuron population to natural stimuli could be used for functional classification. To do so, we recorded from pyramidal cells within the electrosensory lateral line lobe (ELL) of the weakly electric fish Apteronotus leptorhynchus in response to natural electro-communication stimuli as these cells can be anatomically classified into six different types. We then used two independent methodologies to functionally classify responses: one relies of reducing the dimensionality of a feature space while the other directly compares the responses themselves. Both methodologies gave rise to qualitatively similar results: while ON and OFF-type cells could easily be distinguished from one another, ELL pyramidal neuron responses are actually distributed along a continuum rather than forming distinct clusters due to heterogeneities. We discuss the implications of our results for neural coding and highlight some potential advantages.	[Sproule, Michael K.

Although imaging genetics has recently shown great promise in understanding biological mechanisms for brain development and psychiatric disorders, studying the link between genetic variants and neuroimaging phenotypes remains statistically challenging due to the high-dimensionality of both genetic and neuroimaging data. This becomes even more challenging when studying gene-environment interaction (GxE) on neuroimaging phenotypes. In this study, we proposed a set-based mixed effect model for gene-environment interaction (MixGE) on neuroimaging phenotypes, such as structural volumes and tensor-based morphometry (TBM). MixGE incorporates both fixed and random effects of GxE to investigate homogeneous and heterogeneous contributions of multiple genetic variants and their interaction with environmental risks to phenotypes. We discuss the construction of score statistics for the terms associated with fixed and random effects of GxE to avoid direct parameter estimation in the MixGE model, which would greatly increase computational cost. We also describe how the score statistics can be combined into a single significance value to increase statistical power. We evaluated MixGE using simulated and real Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) data, and showed statistical power superior to other burden and variance component methods. We then demonstrated the use of MixGE for exploring the voxelwise effect of GxE on TBM, made feasible by the computational efficiency of MixGE. Through this, we discovered a potential interaction effect of gene ABCA7 and cardiovascular risk on local volume change of the right superior parietal cortex, which warrants further investigation.

Axonal Degeneration in Retinal Ganglion Cells Is Associated with a Membrane Polarity-Sensitive Redox Process	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						axon membrane; axonal degeneration; phosphatidylserine; redox; Wallerian degeneration slow	SLOW WALLERIAN DEGENERATION; PROTEIN-LIPID COMPLEXES; IN-VIVO; PHOSPHOLIPID SCRAMBLASE; PERIPHERAL-NERVE; PHOSPHATIDYLSERINE EXPOSURE; SELF-DESTRUCTION; CALCIUM INFLUX; C57BL/OLA MICE; OPTIC-NERVE	Axonal degeneration is a pathophysiological mechanism common to several neurodegenerative diseases. The slow Wallerian degeneration (WldS) mutation, which results in reduced axonal degeneration in the central and peripheral nervous systems, has provided insight into a redox-dependent mechanism by which axons undergo self-destruction. We studied early molecular events in axonal degeneration with single-axon laser axotomy and time-lapse imaging, monitoring the initial changes in transected axons of purified retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) from wild-type and Wld(S) rat retinas using a polarity-sensitive annexin-based biosensor (annexin B12-Cys101, Cys260-N, N'-dimethyl- N-(iodoacetyl)-N'-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl) ethylenediamine). Transected axons demonstrated a rapid and progressive change in membrane phospholipid polarity, manifested as phosphatidylserine externalization, which was significantly delayed and propagated more slowly in axotomized Wld(S) RGCs compared with wild-type axons. Delivery of bis(3-propionic acid methyl ester) phenylphosphine borane complex, a cell-permeable intracellular disulfide-reducing drug, slowed the onset and velocity of phosphatidylserine externalization in wild-type axons significantly, replicating the WldS phenotype, whereas extracellular redox modulation reversed the Wld(S) phenotype. These findings are consistent with an intra-axonal redox mechanism for axonal degeneration associated with the initiation and propagation of phosphatidylserine externalization after axotomy.

Recent genetic and epigenetic techniques have revealed many genetic determinants of these vascular events and simplified the approaches to research focused on ischaemic heart disease and stroke. The pathogenetic mechanisms of ischaemic heart disease and stroke are complex, with mitochondrial involvement (partially or entirely) recently gaining substantial support. Not only can mitochondrial reactive oxygen species give rise to ischaemic heart disease and stroke by production of oxidised low-density lipoprotein and induction of apoptosis, but the impact on pericytes contributes directly to the pathogenesis. Over the past two decades, publications implicate the causative role of nuclear genes in the development of ischaemic heart disease and stroke, in contrast to the potential role of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in the pathophysiology of the disorders, which is much less understood, although recent studies do demonstrate that the involvement of mitochondria and mtDNA in the development of ischaemic heart disease and stroke is likely to be larger than originally thought, with the novel discovery of links among mitochondria, mtDNA and vascular events. Here we explore the molecular events and mtDNA alterations in relation to the role of mitochondria in ischaemic heart disease and stroke.

Brain metastases (BM) account for 10% of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients at initial presentation, with another 25-40% developing BM during the course of their disease. In the last decade, the field of precision oncology has led to the discovery of a multitude of heterogenous molecular abnormalities within NSCLC as well as the development of tyrosine kinase inhibitors that target them. In this review, the focus will be on targeted therapy and immunotherapy that show efficacy in BM rather than conventional treatment for multiple BM (such as surgical resection, WBRT, or stereotactic radiosurgery).

This study aimed to investigate (1) the reading abilities in patients with the semantic variant of primary progressive aphasia (svPPA), and (2) the relationship between gray matter (GM) volume of the left ATL and word reading performance using voxel-based morphometry (VBM). Three groups of participants (svPPA, Alzheimer's Disease, AD and healthy elderly adults) performed a reading task with exception words, regular words and pseudowords, along with a structural magnetic resonance imaging scan. For exception words, the svPPA group had a lower accuracy and a greater number of regularization errors as compared to the control groups of healthy participants and AD patients. Similarly, for regular words, svPPA patients had a lower accuracy in comparison with AD patients, and a greater number of errors related to complex orthography-to-phonology mappings (OPM) in comparison to both control groups. VBM analyses revealed that GM volume of the left ATL was associated with the number of regularization errors. Also, GM volume of the left lateral ATL was associated with the number of errors with complex OPM during regular word reading. Our results suggest that the left ATL might play a role in the reading of exception words, in accordance with its role in semantic processing. Results further support the involvement of the left lateral ATL in combinatorial processes, including the integration of semantic and phonological information, for both exception and regular words.

However, the oscillatory dynamics within this network and its causal relationship with behavior remain undefined. Using simultaneous MEG/ EEG, we show that theta oscillations in the dorsal stream predict participants' manipulation abilities during memory retention in a task requiring the comparison of two patterns differing in temporal order. We investigated the causal relationship between brain oscillations and behavior by applying thetarhythmic TMS combined with EEG over the MEGidentified target (left intraparietal sulcus) during the silent interval between the two stimuli. Rhythmic TMS entrained theta oscillation and boosted participants' accuracy. TMS-induced oscillatory entrainment scaled with behavioral enhancement, and both gains varied with participants' baseline abilities. These effects were not seen for a melody-comparison control task and were not observed for arrhythmic TMS. These data establish theta activity in the dorsal stream as causally related to memory manipulation.

Several phylogenomic studies have supported the classical scenario in which sponges (Porifera) are the sister group to all other animals ("Porifera-sister"3 hypothesis), consistent with a single origin of the gut, nerve cells, and muscle cells in the stem lineage of eumetazoans (bilaterians + ctenophores + cnidarians). In contrast, several other studies have recovered an alternative topology in which ctenophores are the sister group to all other animals (including sponges). The "Ctenophora-sister" hypothesis implies that eumetazoan-specific traits, such as neurons and muscle cells, either evolved once along the metazoan stem lineage and were then lost in sponges and placozoans or evolved at least twice independently in Ctenophora and in Cnidaria + Bilateria. Here, we report on our reconstruction of deep metazoan relationships using a 1,719-gene dataset with dense taxonomic sampling of non-bilaterian animals that was assembled using a semi-automated procedure, designed to reduce known error sources. Our dataset outperforms previous metazoan gene superalignments in terms of data quality and quantity. Analyses with a best-fitting site-heterogeneous evolutionary model provide strong statistical support for placing sponges as the sister-group to all other metazoans, with ctenophores emerging as the second-earliest branching animal lineage. Only those methodological settings that exacerbated long-branch attraction artifacts yielded Ctenophora-sister. These results show that methodological issues must be carefully addressed to tackle difficult phylogenetic questions and pave the road to a better understanding of how fundamental features of animal body plans have emerged.

Genetic variation in the animal foraging gene, which encodes a cGMP-dependent protein kinase, contributes to variation in the responses of adult fruit flies, Drosophila melanogaster, to early life adversity and is also known to play a role in maternal behavior in social insects. Here we investigate genetic variation in the human foraging gene (PRKG1) as a predictor of individual differences in the effects of early adversity on maternal behavior in two cohorts. We show that the PRKG1 genetic polymorphism rs2043556 associates with maternal sensitivity towards their infants. We also show that rs2043556 moderates the association between self-reported childhood adversity of the mother and her later maternal sensitivity. Mothers with the TT allele of rs2043556 appeared buffered from the effects of early adversity, whereas mothers with the presence of a C allele were not. Our study used the Toronto Longitudinal Cohort (N = 288 mother-16 month old infant pairs) and the Maternal Adversity and Vulnerability and Neurodevelopment Cohort (N=281 mother-18 month old infant pairs). Our findings expand the literature on the contributions of both genetics and gene-environment interactions to maternal sensitivity, a salient feature of the early environment relevant for child neurodevelopment.

Here, we characterized a brain circuitry mediating pain inhibition by reward. Twenty-four healthy participants underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging while playing a wheel of fortune game with simultaneous thermal pain stimuli and monetary wins or losses. As expected, winning decreased pain perception compared to losing. Inter-individual differences in pain modulation by monetary wins relative to losses correlated with activation in the medial orbitofrontal cortex (mOFC). When pain and reward occured simultaneously, mOFCs functional connectivity changed: the signal time course in the mOFC condition-dependent correlated negatively with the signal time courses in the rostral anterior insula, anterior-dorsal cingulate cortex and primary somatosensory cortex, which might signify moment-to-moment down-regulation of these regions by the mOFC. Monetary wins and losses did not change the magnitude of pain-related activation, including in regions that code perceived pain intensity when nociceptive input varies and/or receive direct nociceptive input. Pain inhibition by reward appears to involve brain regions not typically involved in nociceptive intensity coding but likely mediate changes in the significance and/or value of pain.

Experimental study on pressure response to graded spinal canal compromise in an in vitro burst fracture mode	JOURNAL OF CRANIOVERTEBRAL JUNCTION AND SPINE			English	Article						Graded spinal cord pressure; lumbar spine; pig model; spinal canal compromise; thoracic spine	CORD BLOOD-FLOW; ANIMAL-MODEL; INJURY; COMPRESSION; DECOMPRESSION; MECHANISMS; TRAUMA	Background: Spinal cord compression is a known cause of spinal cord injury. The purpose of this study is to measure pressure response during graded spinal cord compression. This information will be important in evaluating the amount of canal compromise that can be tolerated before risking neurological injury secondary to cord compression. To date, there is no published study that has evaluated pressure response to graded canal compromise in the thoracic and lumbar spine. Materials and Methods: A comparative biomechanical investigation using an in vitro burst fracture model of graded spinal canal compromise was performed. Four porcine spines, sectioned into four thoracics and four lumbar segments, were harvested from 30 kg pigs. Graded spinal canal compromise (0.75 mm/30 s) was achieved using a modified 12.7 mm dynamic hip screw. The real-time ventral epidural pressure was measured at each 0.75 mm of canal compromise. Results: A significant increase in spinal cord pressure was recorded during graded spinal cord compression (P < 0.0001), and there were no statistical differences between the increase in pressure measured in the thoracic and lumbar spinal segments (P = 0.83). The pressure to degree of canal compromise curve exhibited an initial rapid rise in pressure followed by incrementally smaller increases in pressure as canal compromise increased. Conclusions: Spinal cord pressure increased with any degree of canal compromise, the most important rise occurring with initial compression. Future studies will evaluate the usefulness of laminectomy in vivo to completely restore ventral epidural pressure in the thoracic and lumbar spine.

The ultimate goal of this study is to identify effective means for increasing healthy life expectancy. The cohort was recruited from the genetic founder population of the Saguenay Lac St Jean region of Quebec, Canada. The participants underwent extensive (15-h) phenotyping, including an hour-long recording of beat-by-beat blood pressure, magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and abdomen, and serum lipidomic profiling with LC-ESI-MS. All participants have been genonne-wide genotyped (with similar to 8 M imputed single nucleotide polymorphisnns) and a subset of them (144 adolescents and their 288 parents) has been genonne-wide epityped (whole blood DNA, Infinium HunnanMethylation450K BeadChip). These assessments are complemented by a detailed evaluation of each participant in a number of domains, including cognition, mental health and substance use, diet, physical activity and sleep, and family environment. The data collection took place during 2003-12 in adolescents (full) and their parents (partial), and during 2012-15 in parents (full). All data are available upon request.

Assessing long-term neurological outcome after such injury is difficult and often characterised by uncertainty. The objective of this feasibility study was to establish the feasibility of conducting a large, multicentre prospective study to develop a prognostic model of long-term neurological outcome in critically ill patients with severe traumatic brain injury. Design: A prospective cohort study. Setting: 9 Canadian intensive care units enrolled patients suffering from acute severe traumatic brain injury. Clinical, biological, radiological and electrophysiological data were systematically collected during the first week in the intensive care unit. Mortality and functional outcome (Glasgow Outcome Scale extended) were assessed on hospital discharge, and then 3, 6 and 12 months following injury. Outcomes: The compliance to protocolised test procedures was the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes were enrolment rate and compliance to follow-up. Results: We successfully enrolled 50 patients over a 12-month period. Most patients were male (80%), with a median age of 45 years (IQR 29.0-60.0), a median Injury Severity Score of 38 (IQR 25-50) and a Glasgow Coma Scale of 6 (IQR 3-7). Mortality was 38% (19/50) and most deaths occurred following a decision to withdraw life-sustaining therapies (18/19). The main reasons for non-enrolment were the time window for inclusion being after regular working hours (35%, n=23) and oversight (24%, n=16). Compliance with protocolised test procedures ranged from 92% to 100% and enrolment rate was 43%. No patients were lost to follow-up at 6 months and 2 were at 12 months. Conclusions: In this multicentre prospective feasibility study, we achieved feasibility objectives pertaining to compliance to test, enrolment and follow-up. We conclude that the TBI-Prognosis prospective multicentre study in severe traumatic brain injury patients in Canada is feasible.

Factors influencing treatment selection and survival in advanced lung cancer	CURRENT ONCOLOGY			English	Article						Advanced lung cancer; non-small-cell lung cancer; small-cell lung cancer; treatment selection; treatment decisions	RANDOMIZED PHASE-II; ADJUVANT CHEMOTHERAPY; REFERRAL PATTERNS; ELDERLY-PATIENTS; COLON-CANCER; ONCOLOGISTS; GEMCITABINE; CARBOPLATIN; PROGNOSES; TRIALS	Purpose Despite numerous breakthrough therapies, inoperable lung cancer still places a heavy burden on patients who might not be candidates for chemotherapy. To identify potential candidates for the newly emerging immunotherapy-based treatment paradigms, we explored the clinical and biologic factors affecting treatment decisions. Methods We retrospectively reviewed the records of patients diagnosed at our university-affiliated cancer centre between 1 January 2011 and 31 December 2013. Patient demographics, systemic treatment, and survival were examined. Results During the 3-year study period, 683 patients fitting the inclusion criteria were identified. First-line therapy was administered in 49.5% of patients; only 22.4% received further lines of therapy. The main reasons for withholding therapy were poor performance status [ps (43.2%)], rapidly deteriorating ps (31.9%), patient refusal of therapy (20.9%), and associated comorbidities (4%). Older age, the presence of brain metastasis at diagnosis, and non-small-cell histology were also associated with therapeutic restraint. Oncology referrals were infrequent in patients who did not receive therapy (32.2%). Older patients and those with a poor ps experienced superior survival when treatment was administered (hazard ratio: 0.25; 95% confidence interval: 0.16 to 0.38; and hazard ratio: 0.44; 95% confidence interval: 0.23 to 0.87 respectively; p < 0.001). Conclusions Advanced lung cancer still poses a therapeutic challenge, with a high proportion of patients being deemed unfit for therapy. This issue cannot be resolved until appropriate measures are taken to ensure the inclusion of older patients and those with a relatively poor ps in large clinical trials. Immunotherapy might be interesting in this setting, given that it appears to be more tolerable. Another consequential undertaking would be the deployment of strategies to reduce wait times during the diagnostic process for patients with a high index of suspicion for lung cancer.

The described architecture relies on a fully differential difference amplifier (FDDA) circuit to detect a wide range of reduction-oxidation currents, while exhibiting low-power consumption and low-noise operation. This is made possible thanks to the fully differential feature of the FDDA, which allows to increase the source voltage swing without the need for additional dedicated circuitry. The FDDA also reduces the number of amplifiers and passive elements in the potentiostat design, which lowers the overall power consumption and noise. The proposed potentiostat was fabricated in 0.18 mu m CMOS, with 1.8 V supply voltage. The device achieved 5 mu A sensitivity and 0.99 linearity. The input-referred noise was 6.9 mu V-rms and the flicker noise was negligible. The total power consumption was under 55 mu W. The complete system was assembled on a 20 mm x 20 mm platform that includes the potentiostat chip, the electrode terminals and an instrumentation amplifier for redox current buffering, once converted to a voltage by a series resistor. the chip dimensions were 1 mm x 0.5 mm and the other PCB components were off-chip resistors, capacitors and amplifiers for data acquisition. The system was successfully tested with ferricyanide, a stable electroactive compound, and validated with dopamine, a popular neurotransmitter.

Participants were recruited from the Angers Memory Clinic, France. Gait speed was assessed at preferred and FWS using a GAITRite walkway. Walking speed reserve (WSR) was calculated as the difference between FWS and preferred speeds. Participants were classified into cognitive stages (cognitively healthy, mild cognitive impairment, mild and moderate dementia) based on neuropsychological evaluations. The proportion of participants with a FWS of < 1.2 m/s was reported. The association between cognitive stage and preferred, fast and walking speed reserve was assessed using multivariable regression, adjusting for covariates. The mean age of the sample (n = 681) was 73.3 (SD 5.8) years. At preferred speed 73.7%, and at FWS 12.8%, of participants had speeds less than 1.2 m/s. Poorer cognitive stage was associated with slower preferred speed (beta -0.08, 95% CI -0.10, -0.06), FWS (beta -0.13, 95% CI -0.16, -0.10) and also with smaller WSR (m/s) (beta -0.05, 95% CI -0.07, -0.03), but not WSR (%) (beta -1.73, 95% CI -4.38, 0.93). In older people, worse stages of cognitive impairment were associated with poorer ability to increase speed and walk quickly. Such limitations may result in reduced ability to access the community.

Participants performed two tasks: a simple counting task in which they had to determine if a visual display contained one or two coloured items among grey fillers and one in which they had to identify a specific relation between two coloured items. The same stimuli were used for both tasks. Each task was designed to permit an easier evaluation of either the same-coloured or differently-coloured stimuli. We predicted a greater involvement of attention and visual working memory for more difficult stimulus-task pairings. The results confirmed these predictions and suggest that visuospatial configurations that require more time to evaluate induce a greater (and presumably longer) involvement of attention and visual working memory.

In a series of experiments we showed participants sequences of images that followed a predictable implied sequence or whose final image violated the implied sequence. Through careful design we were able to use the same final image transitions across predictable and unpredictable conditions, ensuring that any differences in neural responses were due only to preceding context and not to the images themselves. EEG and MEG recordings showed that early (N170) and mid-latency (N300) visual evoked potentials were robustly modulated by images that violated the implied sequence across a range of types of image change (expression deformations, rigid-rotations and visual field location). This modulation occurred irrespective of stimulus object category. Although the stimuli were static images, MEG source reconstruction of the early latency signal (N/M170) localized expectancy violation signals to brain areas associated with motion perception. Our findings suggest that the N/M170 can index mismatches between predicted and actual visual inputs in a system that predicts trajectories based on ongoing context. More generally we suggest that the NMI 70 may reflect a "family" of brain signals generated across widespread regions of the visual brain indexing the resolution of top-down influences and incoming sensory data. This has important implications for understanding the N/M170 and investigating how the brain represents context to generate perceptual predictions. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

There is currently a great potential for research surrounding neuroprotection as it relates to glaucoma. Anatomical targets for neuroprotection should focus on upstream rather than downstream factors, and could include any part of the retinal ganglion cell, the glia, especially astrocytes or Muller cells, and vasculature. The great number of anatomical targets is exceeded only by the number of possible biochemical pathways and potential treatments. Successful treatment may be accomplished through the targeting of one or even a combination of multiple pathways. Once a treatment is shown effective in vitro, it should be evaluated in vivo with carefully chosen animal models and studied in sufficient numbers to detect statistically and clinically significant effects. Such a drug should have few systemic side effects and its delivery should be optimized so as to encourage compliance. There are still a multitude of possible screens available to test the efficacy of a neuroprotective drug and a single gold standard is ideal for the accurate assessment and comparison of new drugs. Future studies in neuroprotection should investigate the genetic component of the disease, novel pharmaceutical agents for new or known pathways, modulations of scleral biomechanics, and relation to research of other complex disorders of the central nervous system.

Good preservation of brain tissue for electron microscopy can be obtained by rigorous cryo-fixation methods, but these techniques are rather costly and limit the use of immunolabeling, which is crucial to understand the connectivity of identified neuronal systems. Freeze-substitution methods have been developed to allow the combination of cryo-fixation with immunolabeling. However, the reproducibility of these methodological approaches usually relies on costly freezing devices. Moreover, achieving reliable results with this technique is very time-consuming and skill-challenging. Hence, the traditional chemically fixed brain, particularly with acrolein fixative, remains a time-efficient and low-cost method to combine electron microscopy with immunohistochemistry. Here, we provide a reliable experimental protocol using chemical acrolein fixation that leads to the preservation of primate brain tissue and is compatible with pre-embedding immunohistochemistry and transmission electron microscopic examination.

To address these questions, we studied fourteen English-speaking monolingual adults enrolled in a 12-week intensive French language-training program in Montreal. Using functional MRI, we investigated the neural changes associated with new language acquisition. The participants were scanned before the start of the immersion program and at the end of the 12 weeks. The fMRI scan aimed to investigate the brain regions recruited in a sentence reading task both in English, their first language (L1), and in French, their second language (L2). For the Ll, fMRI patterns did not change from Time 1 to Time 2, while for the L2, the brain response changed between Time 1 and Time 2 in language-related areas. Of note, for the L2, there was higher activation at Time 2 compared to Time 1 in the left inferior parietal lobule (IPL) including the supramarginal gyrus. At Time 2 this higher activation in the IPL correlated with faster L2 reading speed. Moreover, higher activation in the left IPL at Time 1 predicted improvement in L2 reading speed from Time 1 to Time 2. Our results suggest that learning-induced plasticity occurred as early as 12 weeks into immersive second-language training, and that the IPL appears to play a special role in language learning.

J	Berken, JA; Gracco, VL; Klein, D				Berken, Jonathan A.; Gracco, Vincent L.; Klein, Denise			Early bilingualism, language attainment, and brain development	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Bilingualism; Magnetic resonance imaging; Brain development; Language attainment; Brain function; Brain structure; Neural connectivity	CRITICAL-PERIOD HYPOTHESIS; WORD FORM AREA; SPEECH-PERCEPTION; 2ND-LANGUAGE ACQUISITION; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; CORTICAL DEVELOPMENT; ATTENTIONAL CONTROL; FOREIGN ACCENT; AGE; INFANTS	The brain demonstrates a remarkable capacity to undergo structural and functional change in response to experience throughout the lifespan. Evidence suggests that, in many domains of skill acquisition, the manifestation of this neuroplasticity depends on the age at which learning begins. The fact that most skills are acquired late in childhood or in adulthood has proven to be a limitation in studies aimed at determining the relationship between age of acquisition and brain plasticity. Bilingualism, however, provides an optimal model for discerning differences in how the brain wires when a skill is acquired from birth, when the brain circuitry for language is being constructed, versus later in life, when the pathways subserving the first language are already well developed. This review examines some of the existing knowledge about optimal periods in language development, with particular attention to the attainment of native-like phonology. It focuses on the differences in brain structure and function between simultaneous and sequential bilinguals and the compensatory mechanisms employed when bilingualism is achieved later in life, based on evidence from studies using a variety of neuroimaging modalities, including positron emission tomography (PET), task-based and resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and structural MRI. The discussion concludes with the presentation of recent neuroimaging studies that explore the concept of nested optimal periods in language development and the different neural paths to language proficiency taken by simultaneous and sequential bilinguals, with extrapolation to general notions of the relationship between age of acquisition and ultimate skill performance.

Sleepwalking can be preceded by fluctuations in slow-wave sleep EEG signals, but the significance of these pre-episode changes remains unknown and methods based on EEG functional connectivity have yet to be used to better comprehend the disorder. Methods: We investigated the sleep EEG of 27 adult sleepwalkers (mean age: 29 +/- 7.6 years) who experienced a somnambulistic episode during slow-wave sleep. The 20-second segment of sleep EEG immediately preceding each patient's episode was compared with the 20-second segment occurring 2 minutes prior to episode onset. Results: Results from spectral analyses revealed increased delta and theta spectral power in the 20 seconds preceding the episodes' onset as compared to the 20 seconds occurring 2 minutes before the episodes. The imaginary part of the coherence immediately prior to episode onset revealed (1) decreased delta EEG functional connectivity in parietal and occipital regions, (2) increased alpha connectivity over a fronto-parietal network, and (3) increased beta connectivity involving symmetric inter-hemispheric networks implicating frontotemporal, parietal and occipital areas. Conclusions: Taken together, these modifications in EEG functional connectivity suggest that somnambulistic episodes are preceded by brain processes characterized by the co-existence of arousal and deep sleep.

The aim of this study is to validate a new ecologic neuroimaging tool for quantifying MTA-related hemodynamic response of the cortical motor system by means of functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). Materials 11 right-handed healthy volunteers (six male and five female, age range 27-64 years) were studied with fNIRS and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while performing MTA task for each hand. Results MTA performance was better for the dominant hand and younger participants. Both fNIRS and fMRI analyses revealed MTA-related increase of haemoglobin levels in the primary motor and premotor cortices contralateral to the moving hand. This response progressively increased with aging. Conclusion These findings supported the translation of fNIRS-based MTA behavioural tool in clinical practice.

Little is yet known about the nature of occupational therapists' role in this context. This exploratory study sought to identify factors influencing occupational therapists' perception of acquired brain injury patients' rehabilitation potential for inpatient rehabilitation. Methods: A qualitative approach was used to analyse data from a focus group involving 12 occupational therapists working in acute care and inpatient rehabilitation. A consensus-seeking technique was used to identify patient-related factors participants perceived as most important to consider when assessing rehabilitation potential. The transcription of the group discussion was analysed using an interpretive description approach to identify additional factors influencing occupational therapists' perception. Results: Participants agreed on 11 patient-related factors most important to consider: age, behaviour, cognitive abilities, endurance, home environment, medical status, observed improvement in acute care post-injury, physical abilities, post-injury functional status, pre-injury functional status, patient and family expectations. Additional factors included the influence of the organisational context (i.e. acute care and broader health care context) as well as occupational therapists' professional expertise, knowledge of scientific evidence, concerns for ethical decisions and interpretive activities (i.e. clinician's interpretation of patients' characteristics in light of all other factors). Conclusions: Findings suggest that assessing rehabilitation potential is a complex process that goes beyond strictly appraising patients' characteristics. Additional factors influence clinicians' perception of patients' rehabilitation potential. Clinicians should pay more attention to these factors when making evidence-based decisions regarding patients' potential to benefit from rehabilitation.

We conducted semi-structured qualitative interviews with health care providers, administrators, community organization representatives, opinion leaders and policy makers. The analysis revealed three primary themes related to the availability of and access to prescription drugs to treat neurological conditions. First, we learned that across Canada there is significant vulnerability and a need for advocacy on behalf of people living with these conditions. Second, we learned that the heightened level of vulnerability and need for advocacy stems in part from the significant differences in the drug coverage available in the different provinces and territories. As a result, there are significant inequities across Canada. Third, we determined that the existing situation is also due to the current approach to health governance (i.e., accountability, transparency). Our study provides evidence for the urgent need for a formal discourse on national pharmacare in Canada, with representatives of neurological conditions having a voice at the table.

J	Human, LJ; Thorson, KR; Woolley, JD; Mendes, WB				Human, Lauren J.; Thorson, Katherine R.; Woolley, Joshua D.; Mendes, Wendy Berry			Combining oxytocin administration and positive emotion inductions: Examining social perception and analytical performance	HORMONES AND BEHAVIOR			English	Article						Oxytocin administration; Positive emotion inductions; Social perception; Analytical performance	HIGH-FUNCTIONING AUTISM; INTRANASAL OXYTOCIN; HUMANS; BEHAVIOR; STRESS; RESPONSES; MIND; AFFILIATION; GENEROSITY; COGNITION	Intranasal administration of the hypothalamic neuropeptide oxytocin (OT) has, in some studies, been associated with positive effects on social perception and cognition. Similarly, positive emotion inductions can improve a range of perceptual and performance-based behaviors. In this exploratory study, we examined how OT administration and positive emotion inductions interact in their associations with social and analytical performance. Participants (N = 124) were randomly assigned to receive an intranasal spray of OT (40 IU) or placebo and then viewed one of three videos designed to engender one of the following emotion states: social warmth, pride, or an affectively neutral state. Following the emotion induction, participants completed social perception and analytical tasks. There were no significant main effects of OT condition on social perception tasks, failing to replicate prior research, or on analytical performance. Further, OT condition and positive emotion inductions did not interact with each other in their associations with social perception performance. However, OT condition and positive emotion manipulations did significantly interact in their associations with analytical performance. Specifically, combining positive emotion inductions with OT administration was associated with worse analytical performance, with the pride induction no longer benefiting performance and the warmth induction resulting in worse performance. In sum, we found little evidence for main or interactive effects of OT on social perception but preliminary evidence that OT administration may impair analytical performance when paired with positive emotion inductions.

Spinal intracellular metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) contributes to pain and c-fos expression in a rat model of inflammatory pain	PAIN			English	Article						mGluR5; Nuclear G-protein-coupled receptors; Inflammatory pain; Glutamate transporters; c-fos	NORMAL SENSORY TRANSMISSION; CORD DORSAL-HORN; IN-VIVO; TRANSPORTERS; LOCALIZATION; ANTAGONIST; ACTIVATION; RELEASE; NEURONS; NEUROTRANSMISSION	Metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) is an excitatory G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) present in the spinal cord dorsal horn (SCDH) where it has a well-established role in pain. In addition to its traditional location on the cytoplasmic membrane, recent evidence shows that these receptors are present intracellularly on the nuclear membrane in the spinal cord dorsal horn and are implicated in neuropathic pain. Nuclear mGluR5 is a functional receptor that binds glutamate entering the cell through the neuronal glutamate transporter (GT) EAAT3 and activates transcription factor c-fos, whereas plasma membrane mGluR5 is responsible for c-jun activation. Here, we extend these findings to a model of inflammatory pain using complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) and show that nuclear mGluR5 is also upregulated in the spinal cord dorsal horn following inflammation. We also show that pretreatment with an excitatory amino acid transporter (EAAT) inhibitor attenuates pain and decreases Fos, but not Jun, expression in complete Freund's adjuvant rats. In contrast, selective glial glutamate transporter inhibitors are pronociceptive and increase spinal glutamate concentrations. Additionally, we found that permeable mGluR5 antagonists are more effective at attenuating pain and Fos expression than nonpermeable group I mGluR antagonists. Taken together, these results suggest that under inflammatory conditions, intracellular mGluR5 is actively involved in the relay of nociceptive information in the spinal cord.

Both seizures and antiepileptic treatments may lead to short term complications and worsen the outcomes. Predicting the risks of seizure reoccurrence could enable individual treatment regimens and better outcomes. We aimed to identify EEG signatures of seizure reoccurrence by investigating periictal electrographic features and spectral power characteristics in hypothermic neonates with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) with or without reoccurrence of seizures on rewarming. Methods: We recruited five consecutive HIE neonates, submitted to continuous EEG monitoring, with high seizure burden (>20% per hour) while undergoing therapeutic hypothermia. Two of them had reoccurrence of seizures on rewarming. We performed quantitative analysis of fifteen artifact-free consecutive seizures to appreciate spectral power changes between the interictal, preictal and ictal periods, separately for each patient. Visual analysis allowed description of electrographic features associated with ictal events. Results: Every patient demonstrated a significant increase in overall spectral power from the interictal to preictal and ictal periods (p < 0.01). Alpha power increase was more pronounced in the two patients with reoccurrence of seizures on rewarming and significant when comparing both interictal-to-preictal and interictal-to-ictal periods. This alpha activity increase could be also appreciated using visual analysis and distinguished neonates with and without seizure reoccurrence. Conclusion: This distinct alpha activity preceding ictal onset could represent a biomarker of propensity for seizure reoccurrence in neonates. Future studies should be performed to confirm whether quantitative periictal characteristics and electrographic features allow predicting the risks of seizure reoccurrence in HIE neonates and other critically ill patients.

The final sample included 32 healthy older adults with 8 to 22 years of education. Structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to measure regional volume and functional MRI was used to measure activation associated with performing an n-back task. A positive correlation was found between years of education and cortical grey matter volume in the right medial and middle frontal gyri, in the middle and posterior cingulate gyri, and in the right inferior parietal lobule. The education by age interaction was significant for cortical grey matter volume in the left middle frontal gyrus and in the right medial cingulate gyrus. In this region, the volume loss related to age was larger in the low than high-education group. The education by age interaction was also significant for task-related activity in the left superior, middle and medial frontal gyri due to the fact that activation increased with age in those with higher education. No correlation was found between regions that are structurally related with education and those that are functionally related with education and age. The data suggest a protective effect of education on cortical volume. Furthermore, the brain regions involved in the working memory network are getting more activated with age in those with higher educational attainment.

This amino acid has also been linked to several neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and dementia. Nevertheless, the primary site and mechanism of D-serine release remains unclear. We recently demonstrated the use of an enzymatic amperometric biosensor for the invivo quantification of endogenous D-serine release in Xenopus laevis tadpoles. Herein, we investigate the effect of the permselective poly(meta-phenylenediamine) electropolymerization conditions on the biosensor's response time and selectivity. Scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) is then used with the optimized biosensor to measure localized release of D-serine from a model system. This SECM methodology, which provides high spatial and temporal resolution, could be useful to investigate the primary site and mechanism of d-serine release in other biological samples.

Frequently, however, such estimators are based on the assumption that spike sequences follow a Poisson point process. Because of the bio-physical properties of neuronal action potentials, spike trains are affected by the refractory phenomenon that induces history dependency, and hence contradicts the Poisson assumption. In this work we present a neural spiking model, and a Maximum Likelihood (ML) estimation framework for time varying firing rates, that account for history dependencies in spike trains. Our framework is based on an exponential of polynomial model for the excitation function (stimulus), that generates a self exciting point process representing spike trains with absolute as well as relative refractory effects. Using this framework we employ techniques based on non-convex optimization and model order selection to derive ML estimators for neuronal firing rates. Results on simulated data with a refractory period show an improvement in accuracy when our estimation technique, that accounts for the complete refractory phenomenon, is used. Employing this estimation method for measured neuronal data shows an improvement in goodness of fit over estimators that do not account for the refractory effect, and also over other commonly used techniques.

Objective: To evaluate efficacy and safety of abatacept in RRMS. Methods: ACCLAIM (A Cooperative Clinical Study of Abatacept in Multiple Sclerosis) was a Phase II, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center trial. In all, 65 of 123 planned participants with RRMS were randomized to monthly intravenous infusions of abatacept or placebo for 24 weeks in a 2:1 ratio, switched to the opposite treatment at 28 weeks, and received their final dose of study medication at 52 weeks. Enrollment was closed early due to slow accrual. The primary endpoint was the mean number of new gadolinium-enhancing (Gd+) lesions obtained on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans performed every 4 weeks. Results: No statistically significant differences were observed in mean number of new Gd+ MRI lesions between the abatacept and placebo groups. No statistically significant differences were observed in other MRI and clinical parameters of RRMS disease activity. Abatacept was well tolerated. Conclusion: The ACCLAIM study did not demonstrate efficacy of abatacept in reducing the number of new Gd+ MRI lesions, or clinical measures of disease activity in RRMS.

Best practice policy statement on urodynamic antibiotic prophylaxis in the non-index patient	NEUROUROLOGY AND URODYNAMICS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	ICI-RS Meeting	JUN, 2015	Bristol, ENGLAND	ICI RS		antibiotic prophylaxis; bacteriuria; infection; urodynamics; urodynamic complications; urologic interventions	URINARY-TRACT-INFECTION; SPINAL-CORD-INJURY; ASYMPTOMATIC BACTERIURIA; RISK-FACTORS; DISEASES-SOCIETY; WOMEN; MORBIDITY; DIAGNOSIS; GUIDELINES; MANAGEMENT	AimsAntibiotic prophylaxis before urodynamic testing (UDS) is widely utilized to prevent urinary tract infection (UTI) with only limited guidance. The Society of Urodynamics, Female Pelvic Medicine, and Urogenital Reconstruction (SUFU) convened a Best Practice Policy Panel to formulate recommendations on the urodynamic antibiotic prophylaxis in the non-index patient. MethodsRecommendations are based on a literature review and the Panel's expert opinion, with all recommendations graded using the Oxford grading system. ResultsAll patients should be screened for symptoms of UTI and undergo dipstick urinalysis. If the clinician suspects a UTI, the UDS should be postponed until it has been treated. The first choice for prophylaxis is a single oral dose of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole before UDS, with alternative antibiotics chosen in case of allergy or intolerance. Individuals who do NOT require routine antibiotic prophylaxis include those without known relevant genitourinary anomalies, diabetics, those with prior genitourinary surgery, a history of recurrent UTI, post-menopausal women, recently hospitalized patients, patients with cardiac valvular disease, nutritional deficiencies or obesity. Identified risk factors that increase the potential for UTI following UDS and for which the panel recommends peri-procedure antibiotics include: known relevant neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction, elevated PVR, asymptomatic bacteriuria, immunosuppression, age over 70, and patients with any indwelling catheter, external urinary collection device, or performing intermittent catheterization. Patients with orthopedic implants have a separate risk stratification. ConclusionsThese recommendations can assist urodynamic providers in the appropriate use of antibiotics for UDS testing. Clinical judgment of the provider must always be considered.	[Cameron, Anne P.; Clemens, J.

For instance, correlations in blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal time series are commonly used to make inferences about "functional connectivity." Correlations across samples in structural morphometric measures, such as voxel-based morphometry (VBM) or cortical thickness (CT), have also been used to estimate connectivity, putatively through mutually trophic effects on connected brain areas. In this study, we have compared seed-based connectivity estimates obtained from four common correlational approaches: resting-state functional connectivity (RS-fMRI), meta-analytic connectivity modeling (MACM), VBM correlations, and CT correlations. We found that the two functional approaches (RS-fMRI and MACM) had the best agreement. While the two structural approaches (CT and VBM) had better-than-random convergence, they were no more similar to each other than to the functional approaches. The degree of correspondence between modalities varied considerably across seed regions, and also depended on the threshold applied to the connectivity distribution. These results demonstrate some degrees of similarity between connectivity inferred from structural and functional covariances, particularly for the most robust functionally connected regions (e.g., the default mode network). However, they also caution that these measures likely capture very different aspects of brain structure and function.

To manipulate the demands on model-based decision making, we applied two experimental conditions with different probabilities of transitioning from the first to the second stage of the task. As we expected, when the stage transitions were more predictable, participants showed greater model-based (planning) behavior. Consistent with this result, we found that stimulus-evoked parietal (P300) activity at the second stage of the task increased with the predictability of the state transitions. However, the parietal activity also reflected model-free information about the expected values of the stimuli, indicating that at this stage of the task both types of information are integrated to guide decision making. Outcome-related ERP components only reflected reward-related processes: Specifically, a medial prefrontal ERP component (the feedback-related negativity) was sensitive to negative outcomes, whereas a component that is elicited by reward (the feedback-related positivity) increased as a function of positive prediction errors. Taken together, our data indicate that stimulus-locked parietal activity reflects the integration of model-based and model-free information during decision making, whereas feedback-related medial prefrontal signals primarily reflect reward-related decision processes.

In general, standard microwave measurement methods require cutting and polishing of samples to put it in a suitable waveguide or cavity. However, several methods have been developed in order to permit a non-destructive measurement. A well-known method is based on coaxial open-ended waveguide, which is used as a sensor for dielectric characterizations. Moreover, with the requirement of new forms, developing mathematical model for each one is not convenient. Indeed, the complex structures required in the industrial field can be perfectly designed with high-performance three-dimensional software. Many attempts have been done to solve the conversion problem by proposing different algorithms. Nevertheless, they are sensitive for complex structure that contains transition part. In this paper, we propose a dielectric measurement method based on the use of coaxial waveguide. A novel algorithm for dielectric characterization of complex structures is also presented, which is based on the joint use of artificial neuronal networks and finite element method. The proposed algorithm aims to find the dielectric characterization for complex structures. Experimental evaluations applied to solid and liquid dielectrics confirm the validation of the proposed algorithm.

While this may allow investigators to speed up recruitment or increase sample size, multisite studies also potentially introduce systematic biases in connectivity measures across sites. In this work, we measure the inter-site effect in connectivity and its impact on our ability to detect individual and group differences. Our study was based on real, as opposed to simulated, multisite fMRI datasets collected in N=345 young, healthy subjects across 8 scanning sites with 3 T scanners and heterogeneous scanning protocols, drawn from the 1000 functional connectome project. We first empirically show that typical functional networks were reliably found at the group level in all sites, and that the amplitude of the inter-site effects was small to moderate, with a Cohen's effect size below 0.5 on average across brain connections. We then implemented a series of Monte-Carlo simulations, based on real data, to evaluate the impact of the multisite effects on detection power in statistical tests comparing two groups (with and without the effect) using a general linear model, as well as on the prediction of group labels with a support-vector machine. As a reference, we also implemented the same simulations with fMRI data collected at a single site using an identical sample size. Simulations revealed that using data from heterogeneous sites only slightly decreased our ability to detect changes compared to a monosite study with the GLM, and had a greater impact on prediction accuracy. However, the deleterious effect of multisite data pooling tended to decrease as the total sample size increased, to a point where differences between monosite and multisite simulations were small with N=120 subjects. Taken together, our results support the feasibility of multisite studies in rs-fMRI provided the sample size is large enough.

Investigation of the confounding effects of vasculature and metabolism on computational anatomy studies	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Computational anatomy; Vascular bias; Metabolic bias; Blood volume; Cortical thickness; Grey matter volume	CEREBRAL-BLOOD-FLOW; VOXEL-BASED MORPHOMETRY; GRAY-MATTER CHANGES; HUMAN BRAIN; IN-VIVO; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; OXIDATIVE-METABOLISM; OXYGEN INHALATION; QUANTITATIVE MRI; 3 T	Computational anatomy studies typically use T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging contrast to look at local differences in cortical thickness or grey matter volume across time or subjects. This type of analysis is a powerful and non-invasive tool to probe anatomical changes associated with neurodevelopment, aging, disease or experience-induced plasticity. However, these comparisons could suffer from biases arising from vascular and metabolic subject- or time-dependent differences. Differences in blood flow and volume could be caused by vasodilation or differences in vascular density, and result in a larger signal contribution of the blood compartment within grey matter voxels. Metabolic changes could lead to differences in dissolved oxygen in brain tissue, leading to T1 shortening. Here, we analyze T1 maps and T1-weighted images acquired during different breathing conditions (ambient air, hypercapnia (increased CO2) and hyperoxia (increased O-2)) to evaluate the effect size that can be expected from changes in blood flow, volume and dissolved O-2 concentration in computational anatomy studies. Results show that increased blood volume from vasodilation during hypercapnia is associated with an overestimation of cortical thickness (1.85%) and grey matter volume (3.32%), and that both changes in 02 concentration and blood volume lead to changes in the T1 value of tissue. These results should be taken into consideration when interpreting existing morphometry studies and in future study design. Furthermore, this study highlights the overlap in structural and physiological MRI, which are conventionally interpreted as two independent modalities.	[Tardif, C. L.; Steele, C.

A variant of MRF called vascular MRF (vMRF) followed, that extracted maps of three parameters of physiological importance: cerebral oxygen saturation (SatO(2)), mean vessel radius and cerebral blood volume (CBV). However, this estimation was based on idealized 2-dimensional simulations of vascular networks using random cylinders and the empirical Bloch equations convolved with a diffusion kernel. Here we focus on studying the vascular MR fingerprint using real mouse angiograms and physiological values as the substrate for the MR simulations. The MR signal is calculated ab initio with a Monte Carlo approximation, by tracking the accumulated phase from a large number of protons diffusing within the angiogram. We first study the identifiability of parameters in simulations, showing that parameters are fully estimable at realistically high signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) when the same angiogram is used for dictionary generation and parameter estimation, but that large biases in the estimates persist when the angiograms are different. Despite these biases, simulations show that differences in parameters remain estimable. We then applied this methodology to data acquired using the GESFIDE sequence with SPIONs injected into 9 young wild type and 9 old atherosclerotic mice. Both the pre injection signal and the ratio of post-to-pre injection signals were modeled, using 5 dimensional dictionaries. The vMRF methodology extracted significant differences in SatO(2), mean vessel radius and CBV between the two groups, consistent across brain regions and dictionaries. Further validation work is essential before vMRF can gain wider application.

In this study, the effective drought index (EDI) calculated over daily timescales was utilized to quantify short-term (dry spells) and ongoing drought events using drought monitoring data in Australia. EDI was an intensive DI that considered daily water accumulation with a weighting function applied to daily rainfall data with the passage of time. A statistical analysis of the distribution of water deficit period relative to the base period was performed where a run-sum method was adopted to identify drought onset for any day (i) with EDI (i) < 0 (rainfall below normal). Drought properties were enumerated in terms of (1) severity (AEDI ae<inverted exclamation> accumulated sum of EDIi < 0), (2) duration (DS ae<inverted exclamation> cumulative number of days with EDIi < 0), (3) peak intensity (EDImin ae<inverted exclamation> minimum EDI of a drought event), (4) annual drought severity (YAEDI ae<inverted exclamation> yearly accumulated negative EDI), and (5) accumulated severity of ongoing drought using event-accumulated EDI (EAEDI). The analysis of EDI signal enabled the detection and quantification of a number of drought events in Australia: Federation Drought (1897-1903), 1911-1916 Drought, 1925-1929 Drought, World War II Drought (1937-1945), and Millennium Drought (2002-2010). In comparison with the other droughts, Millennium Drought was exemplified as an unprecedented dry period especially in Victoria (EAEDI ae -4243, DS = 1946 days, EDImin = -4.05, and YAEDI = -4903). For the weather station tested in Northern Territory, the worst drought was recorded during 1925-1929 period. The results justified the suitability of effective drought index as a useful scientific tool for monitoring of drought progression, onset and termination, and ranking of drought based on severity, duration, and peak intensity, which allows an assessment of accumulated stress caused by short- and long-term (protracted) dry events.

Power capacity profile estimation for building heating and cooling in demand-side management	APPLIED ENERGY			English	Article						Smart buildings; Power demand; Residential load sector; Least squares; Parameter estimation; Classification	RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS; ENERGY-CONSUMPTION; RENEWABLE ENERGY; LOAD MANAGEMENT; REGRESSION; MODELS; SYSTEM	This paper presents a new methodology for the estimation of power capacity profiles for smart buildings. The capacity profile can be used within a demand-side management system in order to guide the building temperature operation. It provides a trade-off between the quality of service perceived by the end user and the requirements from the grid in a demand-response context. We use a data-fitting approach and a multiclass classifier to compute the required profile to run a set of electric heating and cooling units via an admission control module. Simulation results validate the performance of the proposed methodology under various conditions, and we compare our approach with neural networks in a real-world based scenario.

Beyond their fundamental role in the stress response, SGs have emerged as key players for human health. As such, SG assembly is associated with cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, ischemia, and virus infections. SGs and granule-related signaling circuits are therefore promising targets to improve therapeutic intervention for several diseases. This is clinically relevant, because pharmacological drugs can affect treatment outcome by modulating SG formation. As membraneless and highly dynamic compartments, SGs regulate translation, ribostasis and proteostasis. Moreover, they serve as signaling hubs that determine cell viability and stress recovery. Various compounds can modulate SG formation and dynamics. Rewiring cell signaling through SG manipulation thus represents a new strategy to control cell fate under various physiological and pathological conditions. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

However, perceptual decision-making is strongly influenced by prestimulus factors such as goals, expectations, and prior knowledge. Using both event-related potentials and functional magnetic resonance imaging, we test the hypothesis that prior threat-related information and related increases in prestimulus brain activity play a key role in subsequent threat-related perceptual decision-making. After viewing threatening and neutral cues, participants detected perceptually degraded threatening and neutral faces presented at individually predetermined perceptual thresholds in a perceptual decision-making task. Compared with neutral cues, threat cues resulted in (1) improved perceptual sensitivity and faster detection of target stimuli; (2) increased late positive potential (LPP) and superior temporal sulcus (STS) activity, both of which are measures of emotional face processing; and (3) increased amygdala activity for subsequently presented threatening versus and neutral faces. Importantly, threat cue-related LPP and STS activity predicted subsequent improvement in the speed and precision of perceptual decisions specifically for threatening faces. Present findings establish the importance of top-down factors and prestimulus neural processing in understanding how the perceptual system prioritizes threatening information.

Methods: We outline rationale, development, inclusion and exclusion criteria, assessment, services offered, community outreach and liaison with potential referral sites, and our research focus on risk and protective factors related to the neural diathesis-stress model of psychosis. Results: Between January 2005 and December 2014, CAYR has received 370 referrals and accepted 177 patients who met UHR criteria based on the Comprehensive Assessment for At Risk Mental States. Conversion rates to a first episode of psychosis were 11%. Our research findings point to high subjective stress levels, poor self-esteem, social support and coping skills, and a dysregulation of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis during the high-risk phase. Conclusions: Our efforts at community outreach have resulted in increasing numbers of referrals and patients accepted to CAYR, highlighting the relevance of and need for a high-risk programme in the Montreal area. Patients with psychotic symptoms can be immediately assigned to the first-episode psychosis clinic within PEPP, which has likely contributed to the low conversion rates observed in the UHR group. Our research findings on stress and protective factors emphasize the importance of psychosocial interventions for high-risk patients.

Lead exposure is related to hypercortisolemic profiles and allostatic load in Brazilian older adults	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Blood lead; cortisol; HPA axis; Allostatic load; Aging	MINI-MENTAL-STATE; BLOOD-PRESSURE; METABOLIC SYNDROME; MEXICO-CITY; BONE LEAD; LIFE-SPAN; STRESS; CORTISOL; MACARTHUR; RISK	Lead levels (Pb) have been linked to both hyper-and hypo-reactivity of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) axis to acute stress in animals and humans. Similarly, allostatic load (AL), the 'wear and tear' of chronic stress, is associated with inadequate HPA axis activity. We examined whether Pb levels would be associated with altered diurnal cortisol profile, as a primary mediator of AL, during aging. Pb levels were measured from blood samples (BPb) of 126 Brazilian individuals (105 women), between 50 and 82 years old. Six neuroendocrine, metabolic, and anthropometric biomarkers were analyzed and values were transformed into an AL index using clinical reference cut-offs. Salivary samples were collected at home over 2 days at awakening, 30-min after waking, afternoon, and evening periods to determine cortisol levels. A multiple linear regression model showed a positive association between BPb as the independent continuous variable and cortisol awakening response (R-2=0.128; B=0.791; p=0.005) and overall cortisol concentration (R-2=0.266; B=0.889; p < 0.001) as the outcomes. Repeated measures ANOVA showed that individuals with high BPb levels showed higher cortisol at 30 min after awakening (p=0.003), and in the afternoon (p=0.002) than those with low BPb values. Regarding AL, regression model showed that BPb was positively associated with AL index (R-2=0.100; B=0.204; p=0.032). Correlation analyzes with individual biomarkers showed that BPb was positively correlated with HDL cholesterol (p=0.02) and negatively correlated with DHEA-S (p=0.049). These findings suggest that Pb exposure, even at levels below the reference blood lead level for adults recommended by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health and by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, may contribute to AL and dysregulated cortisol functioning in older adults. Considering these findings were based on cross-sectional data future research is needed to confirm our exploratory results.

Stimulating TRPV1 externalization and synthesis in dorsal root ganglion neurons contributes to PGE2 potentiation of TRPV1 activity and nociceptor sensitization	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PAIN			English	Article							GENE-RELATED PEPTIDE; RAT SENSORY NEURONS; ACTIVATED ION-CHANNEL; PROSTAGLANDIN E-2; INFLAMMATORY MEDIATORS; TRANSDUCTION CASCADE; AFFERENT NEURONS; NEUROPATHIC PAIN; EP4 RECEPTOR; NERVE INJURY	Background: Persistent peripheral sensitization contributes to chronic pain. Plasticity of nociceptive dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons (nociceptors) induced by pro-inflammatory mediators contributes to sensitization. Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) enriched in injured tissues is known not only directly to sensitize DRG neurons, but also to potentiate sensitizing effects of other pain mediators such as capsaicin and its receptor transient receptor potential vanilloid-1 (TRPV1). It remains unknown whether PGE2 potentiates TRPV1 activity by stimulating its synthesis, cell surface and axonal trafficking in DRG neurons. Methods: Combined biochemical, morphological, pharmacological and behavioral approaches have been used to address this issue in both in vitro and in vivo models. Results: PGE2 increased TRPV1 externalization in cultured rat DRG neurons in a time-and concentration-dependent manner, an event blocked by an inhibitor of protein synthesis or anterograde export. EP1 and EP4, but not EP2 and EP3, mediated this event. EP1 agonistinduced TRPV1 externalization was suppressed by inhibitors of CaMKII, PLC, PKC and PKC epsilon, while EP4 agonist-induced TRPV1 externalization by inhibitors of cAMP/PKA and ERK/MAPK. Pre-exposure to PGE2 potentiated release of calcitonin gene-related peptide from cultured DRG neurons evoked by subsequent capsaicin stimulation. This event was blocked by an inhibitor of protein synthesis or export, suggesting that PGE2-induced TRPV1 synthesis and externalization is coupled to enhanced TRPV1 activity. Pre-exposure to PGE2 not only prolonged tactile allodynia evoked by subsequent capsaicin challenge, but also increased TRPV1 levels in L4-6 DRG, sciatic nerves and plantar skin. Conclusions: Our data indicate that facilitating TRPV1 synthesis, cell surface and axonal trafficking is a novel mechanism underlying PGE2 potentiation of TRPV1 activity.

Pain expectations in neuropathic pain: Is it best to be optimistic?	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PAIN			English	Article							LOW-BACK-PAIN; DISABILITY INDEX; TREATMENT EXPECTANCY; CLINICAL-TRIALS; SELF-EFFICACY; OUTCOMES; RECOMMENDATIONS; INTERVENTIONS; RECOVERY; VALIDITY	Background: Pain expectancy may be an important variable that has been found to influence the effectiveness of treatments for pain. Much of the literature supports a self-fulfilment perspective where expectations for pain relief predict the actual pain experienced. However, in conditions such as neuropathic pain (NeP) where pain relief is difficult to attain, expectations for pain relief could be unrealistic. The objective of this study was to investigate the relationship between realistic/unrealistic expectations and 6-month, post-treatment outcomes. Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of a large cohort of patients with NeP (n=789) attending tertiary care centres to determine the association between unrealistic (both positive and negative) and realistic expectations with outcomes after multidisciplinary treatment. An expectation variable with three categories was calculated: realistic expectations were those whose expected reduction in pain was similar to the observed mean group reduction in pain, while optimistic and pessimistic expectations were those who over-or under-estimated the expected response to treatment, respectively. The association between baseline realistic/unrealistic expectations and 6-month pain-related disability, catastrophizing and psychological distress was assessed. Results: Univariable analyses suggested that realistic expectations were associated with lower levels of disability, catastrophizing and psychological distress, compared to unrealistic expectations. However, after adjustment for baseline symptom severity, multivariable analysis revealed that patients with optimistic expectations had lower levels of disability, than those with realistic expectations. Those with pessimistic expectations had higher levels of catastrophizing and psychological distress at follow-up. Conclusions: These findings are largely congruent with the selffulfilment perspective to expectations. Significance: This study defined realistic pain expectations with patient data. Examining the relationship between expectations between pain and disability in a large cohort of patients with neuropathic pain.	[Bostick, G.

Infants need to capture adults' attention to have their basic needs met. Therefore, infant stimuli are prioritized by the attention system in adults, resulting in an attentional bias toward infant faces. We conducted a systematic review of the literature on behavioral measures of attentional bias toward infant faces. PubMed, PsycINFO, and ISI Web of Knowledge databases were used. The review suggests the existence of a measurable attentional bias toward infant faces and a positive correlation between attentional bias toward infant distress and the quality of mother-infant relationship. Depressive symptoms and breastfeeding modulate this behavior in women. Parental status and sex also influence the attentional prioritization of infant faces. Evidence indicates that differences in attentional bias are associated with clinical symptoms and variations in maternal behavior, reinforcing the potential use of attentional bias as a behavioral marker of clinical outcomes.

Methods: Data were retrospectively collected on patients (n = 982) aged 65 and above who were admitted post TBI to the McGill University Health Centre-Montreal General Hospital from 2000 to 2011. Age, Injury Severity Score (ISS), Glasgow Coma Scale score (GCS), type of trauma (isolated TBI vs polytrauma including TBI), initial CT scan results according to the Marshall Classification and the INR and PTT scores and prescriptions of antiplatelet or anticoagulant agents (AP/AC) were collected. Results: Results also indicated that age, ISS and GSC score have an effect on the GOSE score. We also found that taking AC/AP has an effect on GOSE outcome, but that this effects depends on PTT, with lower odds of a worse outcome for those taking AC/AP agents as the PTT value goes up. However, this effect only becomes significant as the PTT value reaches 60 and above. Conclusion: Age and injury severity rather than antithrombotic agent intake are associated with adverse acute outcome such as GOSE in hospitalized elderly TBI patients. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, insight into the basal pattern of neural organization of the vertebrate olfactory bulb was gained by investigating the lamprey. Retrograde labelling established that lateral and dorsal bulbar territories receive the axons of sensory neurons broadly distributed in the main olfactory epithelium and that the medial region receives sensory neuron input only from neurons projecting from the accessory olfactory organ. The response duration for local field potential recordings was similar in the lateral and dorsal regions, and both were longer than medial responses. All three regions responded to amino acid odorants. The dorsal and medial regions, but not the lateral region, responded to steroids. These findings show evidence for olfactory streams in the sea lamprey olfactory bulb: the lateral region responds to amino acids from sensory input in the main olfactory epithelium, the dorsal region responds to steroids (taurocholic acid and pheromones) and to amino acids from sensory input in the main olfactory epithelium, and the medial bulbar region responds to amino acids and steroids stimulating the accessory olfactory organ. These findings indicate that olfactory subsystems are present at the base of vertebrate evolution and that regionality in the lamprey olfactory bulb has some aspects previously seen in other vertebrate species.

Newborns with HT1 are usually clinically asymptomatic but show liver dysfunction with coagulation abnormalities (prolonged prothrombin time and/or high international normalised ratio). Early treatment with nitisinone (NTBC) plus dietary restriction of tyrosine and phenylalanine prevents the complications of severe liver disease and neurological crises. Methods and results Six newborns referred for hypersuccinylacetonaemia but who had normal coagulation testing on initial evaluation had sequence variants in the GSTZ1 gene, encoding maleylacetoacetate isomerase (MAAI), the enzyme preceding FAH in tyrosine degradation. Initial plasma SA levels ranged from 233 to 1282 nmol/L, greater than normal (< 24 nmol/L) but less than the initial values of patients with HT1 (16 944-74 377 nmol/L, n= 15). Four individuals were homozygous for c.449C>T (p.Ala150Val). One was compound heterozygous for c.259C>T (p.Arg87Ter) and an intronic sequence variant. In one, a single heterozygous GSTZ1 sequence variant was identified, c.295G>A (p. Val99Met). Bacterial expression of p.Ala150Val and p.Val99Met revealed low MAAI activity. The six individuals with mild hypersuccinylacetonaemia (MHSA) were not treated with diet or nitisinone. Their clinical course has been normal for up to 13 years. Conclusions MHSA can be caused by sequence variants in GSTZ1. Such individuals have thus far remained asymptomatic despite receiving no specific treatment.

Hemi-transseptal Approach for Pituitary Surgery: A Follow-Up Study	JOURNAL OF NEUROLOGICAL SURGERY PART B-SKULL BASE			English	Article						skull base; pituitary surgery; endoscopic endonasal; nasoseptal flap	SKULL BASE SURGERY; TRANSSPHENOIDAL SURGERY; SPHENOPALATINE ARTERY; NASOSEPTAL FLAP; RECONSTRUCTION; EXPERIENCE; FOSSA; ANATOMY; REPAIR	Objectives The hemi-transseptal (Hemi-T) approach was developed to overcome the potential drawbacks of the nasoseptal flap (NSF) in endoscopic endonasal transsphenoidal skull base surgery. In this study, we describe further refinements on the Hemi-T approach, and report long-term outcomes as compared with traditional methods of skull base reconstruction. Design A retrospective case-control study. Setting Montreal Neurological Institute and Jewish General Hospital, Montreal, Canada. Participants Patients who underwent endoscopic endonasal transsphenoidal approach to skull base pathology. Main Outcome Measures Operative time, CSF rhinorrhea, and postoperative nasal morbidity. Results A total of 105 patients underwent the Hemi-T approach versus 40 controls. Operative time was shorter using the Hemi-T technique (180.51 +/- 56.9 vs. 202.9 +/- 62 minutes; p = 0.048). The rates of nasal morbidity (septal perforation [5/102 vs. 6/37; p = 0.029] and mucosal adhesion [11/102 vs. 10/39 p=0.027]), fascia lata harvest (21/100 vs. 18/39; p = 0.0028), and postoperative CSF leak rates (7/100 vs. 9/38; p = 0.006) were lower in the Hemi-T group. Conclusion Advantages of the Hemi-T approach over traditional exposure techniques include preservation of the nasal vascular pedicle, shorter operative time, reduced fascia lata harvest rates, and decreased nasal morbidity.

However, results have varied considerably between studies and gray matter (GM) integrity has been largely neglected in these investigations. Given impaired working memory processing after mTBI and its possible association with Alzheimer's disease, we investigated hippocampal integrity and parcellated this structure into five subregions: subiculum, cornu ammonis (CA) 1, CA 2/3, CA 4/dentate gyrus, and stratum radiatum/ lacunosum-moleculare. We also employed shape analysis of bilateral hippocampi to explore whether morphological changes had occurred due to the traumatic injury and conducted neuropsychological memory tests. The sample comprised 15 subjects with mTBI (18-55 years, nine female) and 13 age- and sex-matched healthy control subjects (19-57 years, nine female). Voxelwise analyses showed significantly increased mean diffusivity in patients, compared with controls, in the right hippocampus and three of its five subregions (family-wise error corrected p < 0.05). Additionally, results from probabilistic tractography indicated impaired CA 1 connectivity after mTBI (Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate [FDR] corrected p < 0.05). Shape of bilateral hippocampi did not significantly differ between groups (Benjamini-Hochberg FDR corrected p > 0.05). Subjects with mTBI reported more symptoms and performed worse in a non-standard verbal working memory task. Based on these preliminary findings, we were able to demonstrate altered diffusivity of hippocampal subregions following mTBI, indicating impaired GM microstructural integrity. These differences highlight the potential of diffusion imaging for investigation of subtle yet relevant changes in GM microstructure not detected otherwise following mTBI.

JOURNAL OF NEUROTRAUMA			English	Article						brain injury; behavioral; children; predictors; social	FAMILY ASSESSMENT DEVICE; FUNCTIONAL RECOVERY; SELF-ESTEEM; HEAD-INJURY; CHILDREN; ADOLESCENTS; PARTICIPATION; FRIENDSHIP; SCHOOL; RELIABILITY	This study sought to investigate social and behavioral outcomes 12 months following childhood traumatic brain injury (TBI) and to identify predictors of these outcomes. The study also compared rates of impairment in social and behavioral outcomes at 12 months post-injury between children with TBI and a typically developing (TD) control group. The study comprised 114 children ages 5.5 to 16.0 years, 79 with mild, moderate, or severe TBI and 35 TD children, group-matched for age, sex and socio-economic status. Children with TBI were recruited via consecutive hospital admissions and TD children from the community. Social and behavioral outcomes were measured via parent-rated questionnaires. Analysis of covariance models identified a significant mean difference between the mild and moderate groups for social problems only, but the moderate and severe TBI groups showed a higher rate of impairment, particularly in externalizing problems. Pre-injury function, injury severity, parent mental health, and child self-esteem all contributed significantly to predicting social and behavioral outcomes. Both injury and non-injury factors should be considered when identifying children at risk for long-term difficulties in social and behavioral domains.

Laboratory environmental factors and pain behavior: the relevance of unknown unknowns to reproducibility and translation	LAB ANIMAL			English	Article							STRESS-INDUCED ANALGESIA; INBRED MOUSE STRAINS; NEUROPATHIC PAIN; FEMALE RATS; PRENATAL STRESS; NERVE INJURY; INDUCED ANTINOCICEPTION; VISCERAL HYPERALGESIA; MECHANICAL ALLODYNIA; NOCICEPTIVE RESPONSE	The poor record of basic-to-clinical translation in recent decades has led to speculation that preclinical research is "irreproducible", and this irreproducibility in turn has largely been attributed to deficiencies in reporting and statistical practices. There are, however, a number of other reasonable explanations of both poor translation and difficulties in one laboratory replicating the results of another. This article examines these explanations as they pertain to preclinical pain research. I submit that many instances of apparent irreproducibility are actually attributable to interactions between the phenomena and interventions under study and "latent" environmental factors affecting the rodent subjects. These environmental variables-often causing stress, and related to both animal husbandry and the specific testing context -differ greatly between labs, and continue to be identified, suggesting that our knowledge of their existence is far from complete. In pain research in particular, laboratory stressors can produce great variability of unpredictable direction, as stress is known to produce increases (stress-induced hyperalgesia) or decreases (stress-induced analgesia) in pain depending on its parameters. Much greater attention needs to be paid to the study of the laboratory environment if replication and translation are to be improved.

Evaluation of the effects of iodized salt on the mental development of preschool-aged children: a cluster randomized trial in northern Ethiopia	MATERNAL AND CHILD NUTRITION			English	Article						iodine; children; cognitive development; Ethiopia; iodized salt; RCT	THYROID-HORMONE ACTION; IODINE SUPPLEMENTATION; BRAIN-DEVELOPMENT; EARLY-CHILDHOOD; DOUBLE-BLIND; SCHOOL-AGE; INTELLIGENCE; SCHOOLCHILDREN; DEFICIENCY; METAANALYSIS	A cluster randomized effectiveness trial was used to examine the effects on mental development of introducing iodized salt to children 4 to 6years of age in Ethiopia, where there were reportedly high levels of iodine deficiency. Sixty district clusters were randomized to receive iodized salt early at their markets with assistance from regular salt distributors or later as introduced by market forces. At pre- and post-iodization, 1602 children were given cognitive/language tests (namely School Readiness, WPPSI verbal reasoning, WPPSI Matrix reasoning), and mothers were interviewed concerning demographics, nutrition and health. Children's weight, height, urine and a blood sample were taken. Analyses of covariance, adjusting for clustering and baseline levels were conducted. Urinary iodine concentrations were significantly higher at endline in the intervention children than controls though both medians were above threshold. Overall, less than 5% were anemic. There were no significant main effect differences between groups on the cognitive/language tests, but there were effect modifiers, namely mother's education, child's sex and diet. For example, the intervention group performed better on the school readiness test than controls if their mothers had attended school, but not otherwise. In conclusion, the data are consistent with negative findings from studies where children 6 to 12years were supplemented with an iodine capsule, indicating that the benefits of iodine, in salt or capsule form, for brain development may be restricted to children under 3years. Yet, benefits may be tied to those with more educational resources or may compensate for conditions of disadvantage.

Liver disease leads to hyperammonemia and ammonia toxicity is believed to play a major role in the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy. However, the effects of ammonia are not brain-specific and therefore may also affect other organs and tissues including muscle. The precise pathophysiological mechanisms underlying muscle wasting in chronic liver disease remains to be elucidated. In the present study, we characterized body composition as well as muscle protein synthesis in cirrhotic rats with hepatic encephalopathy using the 6-week bile duct ligation (BDL) model which recapitulates the main features of cirrhosis. Compared to sham-operated control animals, BDL rats display significant decreased gain in body weight, altered body composition, decreased gastrocnemius muscle mass and circumference as well as altered muscle morphology. Muscle protein synthesis was also significantly reduced in BDL rats compared to control animals. These findings demonstrate that the 6-week BDL experimental rat is a relevant model to study liver disease-induced muscle mass loss.

This entails that hyperammonemia leads to an increase in ammonia in all organs and tissues. It is known that the toxic ramifications of ammonia primarily touch the brain and cause neurological impairment. However, the deleterious effects of ammonia are not specific to the brain, as the direct effect of increased ammonia (change in pH, membrane potential, metabolism) can occur in any type of cell. Therefore, in the setting of chronic liver disease where multi-organ dysfunction is common, the role of ammonia, only as neurotoxin, is challenged. This review provides insights and evidence that increased ammonia can disturb many organ and cell types and hence lead to dysfunction.

Trajectory of MS disease course for men and women over three eras	MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS JOURNAL			English	Article						Multiple sclerosis; disease course; epidemiology	BENIGN MULTIPLE-SCLEROSIS; DIAGNOSTIC-CRITERIA; NATURAL-HISTORY; CLINICAL-COURSE; FOLLOW-UP; DISABILITY; PERSPECTIVES; PROGRESSION; REVISIONS; RELAPSES	Background: Heterogeneity in disease course exists within multiple sclerosis (MS) subtypes. Objective: The objective was to estimate disease course heterogeneity over three distinct onset periods (pre-1995, 1995-2004, and 2005-present) for men and women. Methods: Group-based trajectory model (GBTM) was used to estimate clusters of patients following stable or unstable disease progression trajectories based on the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS). Inception cohorts were generated from the Montreal Neurological Institute MS Clinic registry. Stable trajectories were defined as an EDSS. 3.0 and change. 1 point over the study period. Annualized relapse rate (ARR) based on the first 5 years of disease was an explanatory variable. Results: Proportion of women classified as stable was 0% for pre-1995, 69.0% for 1995-2004, and 83.9% post-2005; for men, these proportions were 18.4%, 41.4%, and 53.8%, respectively. Men had lower percentage of stable disease than women in both post-1995 cohorts (chi-square p < 0.0001). ARR was associated with higher disability trajectories in both post-1995 cohort (odds ratios > 1.0) but not in the pre-1995 cohort. Conclusion: Large proportions of patients remain stable at their initial disability level for at least 15 years. Higher ARR increases the odds of patients being in a higher disability trajectory in the latter cohorts.

We hypothesize that more pathogenic T-helper cells are present outside the CNS and a possible relationship to disease severity. Methods: Characterization and enrichment of human CD4+ IL-17+ cells were performed ex vivo using peripheral blood mononuclear cells from natalizumab-treated relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) patients (n = 33), untreated RRMS patients (n = 13), and healthy controls (n = 33). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were performed routinely for patients. Results: Lymphocytes were elevated in peripheral blood of natalizumab-treated patients compared to (u)ntreated patients and healthy controls. Whereas group comparison for CD4+ IL-17+ numbers also differed, CD4+ IFN-gamma+ and CD4+ IL-22+ counts were not increased. CD4+ IL-17+ cells not only expressed but also secreted IL-17. In natalizumab-treated patients, IL-17+ cell frequency was found to correlate with T1-hypointense lesions, but was not an indicator for rebound activity after treatment discontinuation, except in one patient who experienced a fulminant rebound, and interestingly, in whom the highest IL-17+ cell levels were observed. Conclusion: Increased lymphocytes and CD4+ IL-17+ cells in the blood of RRMS patients receiving natalizumab corroborate the drug's mechanism of action, that is, blocking transmigration to CNS. Correlation between IL-17-expressing lymphocytes and T1-hypointense lesions underlines the important role of these cells in the disease pathology.

Mutations in MTFMT have been associated with Leigh syndrome, early-onset mitochondrial leukoencephalopathy, microcephaly, ataxia, and cardiomyopathy. We identified compound heterozygous MTFMT mutations in a patient with a mild neurological phenotype and late-onset progressive visual impairment. MRI studies documented a progressive and selective involvement of the retrochiasmatic visual pathway. MTFMT was undetectable by immunoblot analysis of patient fibroblasts, resulting in specific defects in mitochondrial protein synthesis and assembly of the oxidative phosphorylation complexes. This report expands the clinical and MRI phenotypes associated with MTFMT mutations, illustrating the complexity of genotype-phenotype relationships in mitochondrial translation disorders.

The therapeutic potential of varenicline would escalate if it also diminished conditioned responses elicited by alcohol-predictive cues, which can precipitate relapse in abstinent individuals. We investigated this application, along with the underlying neural substrates, using a robust preclinical assay in which relapse to alcohol-seeking was triggered by re-exposure to an alcohol-associated environmental context. Male, Long-Evans rats received Pavlovian conditioning sessions in which one auditory conditioned stimulus (CS+) was paired with 15% ethanol and a second conditioned stimulus (CS -) was not. Ethanol was delivered into a port for oral consumption and port entries triggered by each CS were recorded. Extinction was then conducted in a different context where the CS+ and CS -were presented without ethanol. To stimulate relapse, both cues were subsequently presented without ethanol in the prior conditioning context. Systemic varenicline (0, 0.5 or 2.5 mg/kg; intraperitoneal) blocked context-induced relapse to alcohol-seeking without affecting the ability to make a port entry. It also reduced context-induced relapse to sucrose-seeking, but only at the 2.5 mg/kg dose. Neuropharmacological studies showed that context-induced relapse to alcohol-seeking was attenuated by bilateral microinfusion of varenicline (0.3 mu l/side) into the nucleus accumbens (NAc; 0 or 3.5 mu g), but not the ventral tegmental area (0, 2 or 4 mu g). These data show for the first time that varenicline reduces relapse triggered by contexts that predict alcohol, and suggest that nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the NAc are critical for this effect.

Epidemiology and Outcomes of Arterial Ischemic Stroke in Children: The Canadian Pediatric Ischemic Stroke Registry	PEDIATRIC NEUROLOGY			English	Article						pediatric; ischemic; stroke; incidence; epidemiology	CEREBRAL SINOVENOUS THROMBOSIS; RISK-FACTORS; CHILDHOOD STROKE; ARTERIOPATHY; ASSOCIATION; INFARCTION; INFECTION; DISEASE; BURDEN; INJURY	BACKGROUND: Pediatric arterial ischemic stroke remains incompletely understood. Population-based epidemiological data inform clinical trial design but are scant in this condition. We aimed to determine age specific epidemiological characteristics of arterial ischemic stroke in neonates (birth to 28 days) and older children (29 days to 18 years). METHODS: We conducted a 16-year, prospective, national population-based study, the Canadian Pediatric Ischemic Stroke Registry, across all 16 Canadian acute care children's hospitals. We prospectively enrolled children with arterial ischemic stroke from January 1992 to December 2001 and documented disease incidence, presentations, risk factors, and treatments. Study outcomes were assessed throughout 2008, including abnormal clinical outcomes (stroke-related death or neurological deficit) and recurrent arterial ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack. RESULTS: Among 1129 children enrolled with arterial ischemic stroke, stroke incidence was 1.72/100,000/year, (neonates 10.2/100,000 live births). Detailed clinical and radiological information were available for 933 children (232 neonates and 701 older children, 55% male). The predominant clinical presentations were seizures in neonates (88%), focal deficits in older children (77%), and diffuse neurological signs (54%) in both. Among neonates, 44% had no discernible risk factors. In older children, arteriopathy (49% of patients with vascular imaging), cardiac disorders (28%), and prothrombotic disorders (35% of patients tested) predominated. Antithrombotic treatment increased during the study period (P < 0.001). Stroke-specific mortality was 5%. Outcomes included neurological deficits in 60% of neonates and 70% of older children. Among neonates, deficits emerged during follow-up in 39%. Overall, an initially decreased level of consciousness, a nonspecific systemic presentation, and the presence of stroke risk factors predicted abnormal outcomes. For neonates, predictors were decreased level of consciousness, nonspecific systemic presentation, and basal ganglia infarcts. For older children, predictors were initial seizures, nonspecific systemic presentation, risk factors, and lack of antithrombotic treatment. Recurrent arterial ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack developed in 12% of older children and was predicted by arteriopathy, presentation without seizures, and lack of antithrombotic treatment. Emerging deficit was predicted by neonatal age at stroke and by cardiac disease. CONCLUSIONS: This national data set provides a population-based disease incidence rate and demonstrates the protective effect of antithrombotic treatment in older children, and frequent long-term emerging deficits in neonates and in children with cardiac disorders. Further clinical trials are required to develop effective age-appropriate treatments for children with acute arterial ischemic stroke. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Inc.

Breastfeeding, Cognitive and Noncognitive Development in Early Childhood: A Population Study	PEDIATRICS			English	Article							POLYUNSATURATED FATTY-ACID; DOCOSAHEXAENOIC ACID; RANDOMIZED-TRIAL; WORKING-MEMORY; BRAIN; AGE; METAANALYSIS; CHILDREN; LANGUAGE; BEHAVIOR	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: There is mixed evidence from correlational studies that breastfeeding impacts children's development. Propensity score matching with large samples can be an effective tool to remove potential bias from observed confounders in correlational studies. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of breastfeeding on children's cognitive and noncognitive development at 3 and 5 years of age. METHODS: Participants included similar to 8000 families from the Growing Up in Ireland longitudinal infant cohort, who were identified from the Child Benefit Register and randomly selected to participate. Parent and teacher reports and standardized assessments were used to collect information on children's problem behaviors, expressive vocabulary, and cognitive abilities at age 3 and 5 years. Breastfeeding information was collected via maternal report. Propensity score matching was used to compare the average treatment effects on those who were breastfed. RESULTS: Before matching, breastfeeding was associated with better development on almost every outcome. After matching and adjustment for multiple testing, only 1 of the 13 outcomes remained statistically significant: children's hyperactivity (difference score, -0.84; 95% confidence interval, -1.33 to -0.35) at age 3 years for children who were breastfed for at least 6 months. No statistically significant differences were observed postmatching on any outcome at age 5 years. CONCLUSIONS: Although 1 positive benefit of breastfeeding was found by using propensity score matching, the effect size was modest in practical terms. No support was found for statistically significant gains at age 5 years, suggesting that the earlier observed benefit from breastfeeding may not be maintained once children enter school.

Forty-five adults aged 18 to 40 were recruited: 15 schizophrenia patients (DSM-IV criteria) treated with ziprasidone (mean daily dose = 120 mg), 15 patients treated with other antipsychotics, and 15 healthy controls who did not receive any medication. Functional and structural neuro-imaging data were acquired at baseline and 16 weeks after treatment initiation. In each session, participants selected stimuli, taken from standardized sets, based on their emotional valence. After ziprasidone treatment, several prefrontal regions, typically involved in cognitive control (anterior cingulate and ventrolateral prefrontal cortices), were significantly activated in patients in response to positive versus negative stimuli. This effect was greater whenever they had to select negative compared to positive stimuli, indicating an asymmetric effect of cognitive treatment of emotionally laden information. No such changes were observed for patients under other antipsychotics. In addition, there was an increase in the brain volume commonly recruited by healthy controls and patients under ziprasidone, in response to cognitive processing of emotional information. The structural analysis showed no significant changes in the density of gray and white matter in ziprasidone-treated patients compared to patients receiving other antipsychotic treatments. Our results suggest that functional changes in brain activity after ziprasidone medication precede structural and clinical manifestations, as markers that the treatment is efficient in restoring the functionality of prefrontal circuits involved in processing emotionally laden information in schizophrenia.

Fetal Origins of Mental Health: The Developmental Origins of Health and Disease Hypothesis	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY			English	Article							LOW-BIRTH-WEIGHT; ATTENTION-DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; MATERNAL ANTENATAL ANXIETY; PRENATAL STRESS; PRETERM BIRTH; COGNITIVE-DEVELOPMENT; INFANT TEMPERAMENT; SALIVARY CORTISOL; PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS; DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS	The quality of fetal growth and development predicts the risk for a range of noncommunicable, chronic illnesses. These observations form the basis of the "developmental origins of health and disease" hypothesis, which suggests that the intrauterine signals that compromise fetal growth also act to "program" tissue differentiation in a manner that predisposes to later illness. Fetal growth also predicts the risk for later psychopathology. These findings parallel studies showing that antenatal maternal emotional well-being likewise predicts the risk for later psychopathology. Taken together, these findings form the basis for integrative models of fetal neurodevelopment, which propose that antenatal maternal adversity operates through the biological pathways associated with fetal growth to program neurodevelopment. The authors review the literature and find little support for such integrated models. Maternal anxiety, depression, and stress all influence neurodevelopment but show modest, weak, or no associations with known stress mediators (e.g., glucocorticoids) or with fetal growth. Rather, compromised fetal development appears to establish a "meta-plastic" state that increases sensitivity to postnatal influences. There also remain serious concerns that observational studies associating either fetal growth or maternal mental health with neurodevelopmental outcomes fail to account for underlying genetic factors. Finally, while the observed relation between fetal growth and adult health has garnered considerable attention, the clinical relevance of these associations remains to be determined. There are both considerable promise and important challenges for future studies of the fetal origins of mental health.

In all cases, the links between input stimuli, output actions, reinforcements and punishments are strengthened depending on the stability of the delays between them. To account for the parallel processing nature of neural networks, the SNN is implemented on a field-programmable gate array (FPGA), and the neural delays are extracted via an adaptation of the synapto-dendritic kernel adapting neuron (SKAN) model, for a low resource demanding FPGA implementation of the SNN. A custom robotic platform successfully tested the ability of the proposed architecture to implement the five LC behaviors. Hence, this work contributes to the engineering field by proposing a scalable low resource demanding architecture for adaptive systems, and the cognitive field by suggesting that both CC and OC can be modeled as a single cognitive architecture.

Social Decision-Making and the Brain: A Comparative Perspective	TRENDS IN COGNITIVE SCIENCES			English	Review							AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDERS; MACAQUE MACACA-MULATTA; RHESUS MACAQUES; INTRANASAL OXYTOCIN; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; NEURAL MECHANISMS; BEHAVIOR; OTHERS; ATTENTION; COGNITION	The capacity and motivation to be social is a key component of the human adaptive behavioral repertoire. Recent research has identified social behaviors remarkably similar to our own in other animals, including empathy, consolation, cooperation, and strategic deception. Moreover, neurobiological studies in humans, nonhuman primates, and rodents have identified shared brain structures (the so-called 'social brain') apparently specialized to mediate such functions. Neuromodulators may regulate social interactions by 'tuning' the social brain, with important implications for treating social impairments. Here, we survey recent findings in social neuroscience from a comparative perspective, and conclude that the very social behaviors that make us human emerge from mechanisms shared widely with other animals, as well as some that appear to be unique to humans and other primates.

Early-Onset Invasive Candidiasis in Extremely Low Birth Weight Infants: Perinatal Acquisition Predicts Poor Outcome	CLINICAL INFECTIOUS DISEASES			English	Article						systemic candidiasis; invasive candidiasis; neonatal candidiasis; congenital candidiasis; ELBW	CONGENITAL CUTANEOUS CANDIDIASIS; OF-THE-LITERATURE; RISK-FACTORS; NEONATAL CANDIDIASIS; SYSTEMIC CANDIDIASIS; PRETERM INFANTS; INFECTION; MANIFESTATIONS; EPIDEMIOLOGY; PARAPSILOSIS	Background. Neonatal invasive candidiasis (IC) presenting in the first week of life is less common and less well described than later-onset IC. Risk factors, clinical features, and disease outcomes have not been studied in early-onset disease (EOD, <= 7 days) or compared to late-onset disease (LOD, >7 days). Methods. All extremely low birth weight ( ELBW, < 1000 g) cases with IC and controls from a multicenter study of neonatal candidiasis enrolled from 2001 to 2003 were included in this study. Factors associated with occurrence and outcome of EOD in ELBW infants were determined. Results. Forty-five ELBW infants and their 84 matched controls were included. Fourteen (31%) ELBW infants had EOD. Birth weight < 750 g, gestation < 25 weeks, chorioamnionitis, and vaginal delivery were all strongly associated with EOD. Infection with Candida albicans, disseminated disease, pneumonia, and cardiovascular disease were significantly more common in EOD than in LOD. The EOD case fatality rate (71%) was higher than in LOD (32%) or controls (15%) (P =.0001). The rate of neurodevelopmental impairment and mortality combined was similar in EOD (86%) and LOD (72%), but higher than in controls (32%; P =.007). Conclusions. ELBW infants with EOD have a very poor prognosis compared to those with LOD. The role of perinatal transmission in EOD is supported by its association with chorioamnionitis, vaginal delivery, and pneumonia. Dissemination and cardiovascular involvement are common, and affected infants often die. Empiric treatment should be considered for ELBW infants delivered vaginally who have pneumonia and whose mothers have chorioamnionitis or an intrauterine foreign body.

PARP-1 is required for retrieval of cocaine-associated memory by binding to the promoter of a novel gene encoding a putative transposase inhibitor	MOLECULAR PSYCHIATRY			English	Article							CONDITIONED PLACE PREFERENCE; LONG-TERM POTENTIATION; CENTRAL AMYGDALA; SEEKING BEHAVIOR; BASOLATERAL AMYGDALA; POLYADP-RIBOSYLATION; CONTEXTUAL MEMORY; SIGNALING PATHWAY; DRUG-ABUSE; HISTONE H1	Reward-related memory is an important factor in cocaine seeking. One necessary signaling mechanism for long-term memory formation is the activation of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1), via poly(ADP-ribosyl) ation. We demonstrate herein that autopoly( ADP-ribosyl) ation of activated PARP-1 was significantly pronounced during retrieval of cocaine-associated contextual memory, in the central amygdala (CeA) of rats expressing cocaine-conditioned place preference (CPP). Intra-CeA pharmacological and short hairpin RNA depletion of PARP-1 activity during cocaine-associated memory retrieval abolished CPP. In contrast, PARP-1 inhibition after memory retrieval did not affect CPP reconsolidation process and subsequent retrievals. Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing revealed that PARP-1 binding in the CeA is highly enriched in genes involved in neuronal signaling. We identified among PARP targets in CeA a single gene, yet uncharacterized and encoding a putative transposase inhibitor, at which PARP-1 enrichment markedly increases during cocaine-associated memory retrieval and positively correlates with CPP. Our findings have important implications for understanding drug-related behaviors, and suggest possible future therapeutic targets for drug abuse.

Work in monozygotic (MZ) twins suggests that this association is driven by non-shared environmental factors. This correlation could be the result of in utero impacts on DNA methylation. The aim of the present study with MZ twins is to replicate the association between discordance in BW and brain morphology and test whether discordance in DNA methylation mediates this relationship. Methods: One hundred and four adolescent MZ twins (52 pairs, of which 42% were male pairs) who have been followed regularly since birth underwent T1 weighted structural MRI, and epigenome-wide assessment of DNA methylation from saliva at age 15. Results: Co-twins had very similar measures of DNA methylation and cortical morphology. Higher BW members of a twin pair had increased total cortical surface area, and decreased cortical thickness compared to their lower BW sibling. BW Discordance was positively associated with both cortical surface area and cortical volume discordance. Genes involved in neurodevelopment were tentatively identified as mediators of both the BW - cortical volume, and BW- cortical surface area relationships. Conclusions: The association between BW and cortical morphology in adolescence appears to be attributable to in utero environmental effects, and DNA methylation may play a role in mediating this relationship.

Here, we present a framework to assemble primate brain's biologically plausible anatomical backbone for such modeling initiatives. In this framework, structural connectivity is determined by adding complementary information from invasive macaque axonal tract tracing and non-invasive human diffusion tensor imaging. Both modalities are combined by means of available interspecies registration tools and a newly developed Bayesian probabilistic modeling approach to extract common connectivity evidence. We demonstrate how this novel framework is embedded in the whole-brain simulation platform called The Virtual Brain (TVB). (C) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Biomarkers, Designs, and Interpretations of Resting-State fMRI in Translational Pharmacological Research: A Review of State-of-the-Art, Challenges, and Opportunities for Studying Brain Chemistry	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING			English	Review						resting state fMRI; arterial spin labeling; drug; pharmacological neuroimaging; biomarkers; translational research; PK/PD modeling; functional connectivity; brain chemistry; pharma-fMRI	CEREBRAL-BLOOD-FLOW; POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; TEST-RETEST RELIABILITY; DEFAULT-MODE NETWORK; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY MRI; BOLD SIGNAL FLUCTUATIONS; ANTI-CORRELATED NETWORKS; PROPOFOL-INDUCED LOSS; LOW-FREQUENCY FLUCTUATION	A decade of research and development in resting-state functional MRI (RSfMRI) has opened new translational and clinical research frontiers. This review aims to bridge between technical and clinical researchers who seek reliable neuroimaging biomarkers for studying drug interactions with the brain. About 85 pharma-RSfMRI studies using BOLD signal (75% of all) or arterial spin labeling (ASL) were surveyed to investigate the acute effects of psychoactive drugs. Experimental designs and objectives include drug fingerprinting dose-response evaluation, biomarker validation and calibration, and translational studies. Common biomarkers in these studies include functional connectivity, graph metrics, cerebral blood flow and the amplitude and spectrum of BOLD fluctuations. Overall, RSfMRI-derived biomarkers seem to be sensitive to spatiotemporal dynamics of drug interactions with the brain. However, drugs cause both central and peripheral effects, thus exacerbate difficulties related to biological confounds, structured noise from motion and physiological confounds, as well as modeling and inference testing. Currently, these issues are not well explored, and heterogeneities in experimental design, data acquisition and preprocessing make comparative or meta-analysis of existing reports impossible. A unifying collaborative framework for data-sharing and data-mining is thus necessary for investigating the commonalities and differences in biomarker sensitivity and specificity, and establishing guidelines. Multimodal datasets including sham-placebo or active control sessions and repeated measurements of various psychometric, physiological, metabolic and neuroimaging phenotypes are essential for pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modeling and interpretation of the findings. We provide a list of basic minimum and advanced options that can be considered in design and analyses of future pharma-RSfMRI studies.

This study was designed to determine whether interviewers' personal characteristics are associated with adherence to a structured interview protocol (National Institute of Child and Human Development), the use of open-ended questions and the amount of details provided in children's responses during investigative interviews with alleged victims of child sexual abuse. 114 interviews were scored from 13 police investigators after they followed a one-week training program. Results showed that experience, emotional intelligence, Extraversion, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness and Neuroticism were related with adherence to the protocol and ratio of open-ended questions. Cognitive abilities were related to the amount of details obtained from the child. Generalized estimating equations were used to compare relative contribution of each variable. These findings raise questions about how investigative interviewers are selected and trained.

In this paper, we present a user-centered system for signature verification that performs such a kinematic analysis to verify the identity of the user. It is one of the first systems that is based on a direct comparison of the elementary neuromuscular strokes which are detected in the handwriting. Taking into account the number of strokes, their similarity, and their timing, the string edit distance is employed to derive a dissimilarity measure for signature verification. On several benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that this neuromuscular analysis is complementary to a well-established verification using dynamic time warping. By combining both approaches, our verifier is able to outperform current state-of-the-art results in on-line signature verification.

J	Zhang, XY; Xie, GS; Liu, CL; Bengio, Y				Zhang, Xu-Yao; Xie, Guo-Sen; Liu, Cheng-Lin; Bengio, Yoshua			End-to-End Online Writer Identification With Recurrent Neural Network	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON HUMAN-MACHINE SYSTEMS			English	Article						End-to-end; long short-term memory (LSTM); online handwriting; recurrent neural network (RNN); writer identification	SIGNATURE VERIFICATION; REPRESENTATION; RECOGNITION; SYSTEM; LSTM	Writer identification is an important topic for pattern recognition and artificial intelligence. Traditional methods rely heavily on sophisticated hand-crafted features to represent the characteristics of different writers. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end framework for online text-independent writer identification by using a recurrent neural network (RNN). Specifically, the handwriting data of a particular writer are represented by a set of random hybrid strokes (RHSs). Each RHS is a randomly sampled short sequence representing pen tip movements (xy-coordinates) and pen-down or pen-up states. RHS is independent of the content and language involved in handwriting; therefore, writer identification at the RHS level is more general and convenient than the character level or the word level, which also requires character/word segmentation. The RNN model with bidirectional long short-term memory is used to encode each RHS into a fixed-length vector for final classification. All the RHSs of a writer are classified independently, and then, the posterior probabilities are averaged to make the final decision. The proposed framework is end-to-end and does not require any domain knowledge for handwriting data analysis. Experiments on both English (133 writers) and Chinese (186 writers) databases verify the advantages of our method compared with other state-of-the-art approaches.

The main purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of different dysphonia measurements on PD detection by support vector machine (SVM). Seven categories of dysphonia measurements are considered. Experimental results from ten-fold cross-validation technique demonstrate that vocal fundamental frequency statistics yield the highest accuracy of 88% +/- 0.04. When all dysphonia measurements are employed, the SVM classifier achieves 94% +/- 0.03 accuracy. A refinement of the original patterns space by removing dysphonia measurements with similar variation across healthy and PD subjects allows achieving 97.03% +/- 0.03 accuracy. The latter performance is larger than what is reported in the literature on the same dataset with ten-fold cross-validation technique. Finally, it was found that measures of ratio of noise to tonal components in the voice are the most suitable dysphonic symptoms to detect PD subjects as they achieve 99.64% +/- 0.01 specificity. This finding is highly promising for understanding PD symptoms. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A guideline to select an estimation model of daily global solar radiation between geostatistical interpolation and stochastic simulation approaches	RENEWABLE ENERGY			English	Article						Artificial neural networks; Geostatistical interpolation; Global solar radiation; Spatial correlation; Temperature; Relative humidity	ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; TEMPERATURE; CANADA	This study compares geostatistical interpolation and stochastic simulation approaches for the estimation of daily global solar radiation (GSR) on a horizontal surface in order to fill in missing values and to extend short record length of a meteorological station. A guideline to select an approach is suggested based on this comparison. Three geostatistical interpolation models are developed using the nearest neighbor (NN), inverse distance weighted (IDW), and ordinary kriging (OK) schemes. Three stochastic simulation models are also developed using the artificial neural network (ANN) method with daily temperature (ANN(T)), relative humidity (ANN(H)), and both (ANN(TH)) variables as predictors. The six models are compared at 13 meteorological stations located across southern Quebec, Canada. The three geostatistical interpolation models yield better performances at stations located in a high density area of GSR measuring stations compared to the three stochastic simulation models. The guideline suggests an optimal approach by comparing a threshold distance, estimated according to a performance criteria of a stochastic simulation model, to the distance between a target and its nearest neighboring station. Additionally, the spatial correlation strength of daily GSRs and the at-site correlation strength between daily GSRs and the predictor variables should be considered. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The impact of inspired oxygen levels on calibrated fMRI measurements of M, OEF and resting CMRO2 using combined hypercapnia and hyperoxia	PLOS ONE			English	Article							CEREBRAL-BLOOD-FLOW; TEST-RETEST RELIABILITY; BRAIN IMAGES; REPRODUCIBILITY; MRI; RESPONSES; BOLD; TIME; METABOLISM; INHALATION	Recent calibrated fMRI techniques using combined hypercapnia and hyperoxia allow the mapping of resting cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2) in absolute units, oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) and calibration parameter M (maximum BOLD). The adoption of such technique necessitates knowledge about the precision and accuracy of the model derived parameters. One of the factors that may impact the precision and accuracy is the level of oxygen provided during periods of hyperoxia (HO). A high level of oxygen may bring the BOLD responses closer to the maximum Mvalue, and hence reduce the error associated with the M interpolation. However, an increased concentration of paramagnetic oxygen in the inhaled air may result in a larger susceptibility area around the frontal sinuses and nasal cavity. Additionally, a higher O-2 level may generate a larger arterial blood T-1 shortening, which require a bigger cerebral blood flow (CBF) T-1 correction. To evaluate the impact of inspired oxygen levels on M, OEF and CMRO2 estimates, a cohort of six healthy adults underwent two different protocols: one where 60% of 02 was administered during HO (low HO or LHO) and one where 100% O-2 was administered (high HO or HHO). The QUantitative O-2 (QUO2) MRI approach was employed, where CBF and R2* are simultaneously acquired during periods of hypercapnia (HC) and hyperoxia, using a clinical 3 T scanner. Scan sessions were repeated to assess repeatability of results at the different O-2 levels. Our T-1 values during periods of hyperoxia were estimated based on an empirical ex-vivo relationship between T-1 and the arterial partial pressure of O-2. As expected, our T-1 estimates revealed a larger T-1 shortening in arterial blood when administering 100% 02 relative to 60% 02 (T-1LHO= 1.56 +/- 0.01 sec vs. T-1HHO = 1.47 +/- 0.01 sec, P < 4*10(-13)). In regard to the susceptibility artifacts, the patterns and number of affected voxels were comparable irrespective of the O-2 concentration. Finally, the model-derived estimates were consistent regardless of the HO levels, indicating that the different effects are adequately accounted for within the model.

However, high levels of F-18-THK5351 retention in brain regions thought to contain negligible concentrations of PHF raise questions about the interpretation of the positron emission tomography (PET) signals, particularly given previously described interactions between quinolone derivatives and monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B). Here, we tested the effects of MAO-B inhibition on F-18-THK5351 brain uptake using PET and autoradiography. Methods: Eight participants (five mild cognitive impairment, two Alzheimer's disease, and one progressive supranuclear palsy) had baseline F-18-AZD4694 and F-18-THK5351 scans in order to quantify brain amyloid and PHF load, respectively. A second F-18-THK5351 scan was conducted 1 week later, 1 h after a 10-mg oral dose of selegiline. Three out of eight patients also had a third F-18-THK5351 scan 9-28 days after the selegiline administration. The primary outcome measure was standardized uptake value (SUV), calculated using tissue radioactivity concentration from 50 to 70 min after F-18-THK5351 injection, normalizing for body weight and injected radioactivity. The SUV ratio (SUVR) was determined using the cerebellar cortex as the reference region. F-18-THK5351 competition autoradiography studies in postmortem tissue were conducted using 150 and 500 nM selegiline. Results: At baseline, F-18-THK5351 SUVs were highest in the basal ganglia (0.64 +/- 0.11) and thalamus (0.62 +/- 0.14). In the post-selegiline scans, the regional SUVs were reduced on average by 36.7% to 51.8%, with the greatest reduction noted in the thalamus (51.8%) and basal ganglia (51.4%). MAO-B inhibition also reduced F-18-THK5351 SUVs in the cerebellar cortex (41.6%). The SUVs remained reduced in the three patients imaged at 9-28 days. Tissue autoradiography confirmed the effects of MAO-B inhibition on F-18-THK5351 uptake. Conclusions: These results indicate that the interpretation of F-18-THK5351 PET images, with respect to tau, is confounded by the high MAO-B availability across the entire brain. In addition, the heterogeneous MAO-B availability across the cortex may limit the interpretation of F-18-THK5351 scans using reference region methods.

Homeostatic Changes in GABA and Glutamate Receptors on Excitatory Cortical Neurons during Sleep Deprivation and Recovery	FRONTIERS IN SYSTEMS NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						AMPA; Arc; CaMKII alpha; GABA(A); gamma activity; GluA1	DEPENDENT PROTEIN-KINASE; SYNAPTIC AMPA RECEPTORS; NEOCORTICAL NEURONS; BARREL CORTEX; WAKE CYCLE; RAT-BRAIN; IN-VIVO; PLASTICITY; EXPRESSION; SYNAPSES	Neuronal activity is regulated in a homeostatic manner through changes in inhibitory GABA and excitatory glutamate (Glu) AMPA (A) receptors (GluARs). Using immunofluorescent staining, we examined whether calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II alpha (CaMKII alpha)-labeled (+) excitatory neurons in the barrel cortex undergo such homeostatic regulation following enforced waking with associated cortical activation during the day when mice normally sleep the majority of the time. Sleep deprived mice were prevented from falling asleep by unilateral whisker stimulation and sleep recovery (SR) mice allowed to sleep freely following deprivation. In parallel with changes in c-Fos reflecting changes in activity, (beta 2-3 subunits of) GABA(A) Rs were increased on the membrane of CaMKII a + neurons with enforced waking and returned to baseline levels with SR in barrel cortex on sides both contra-and ipsilateral to the whisker stimulation. The GABA(A)R increase was correlated with increased gamma electroencephalographic (EEG) activity across conditions. On the other hand, (GluA1 subunits of) AMPA Rs were progressively removed from the membrane of CaMKII alpha+ neurons by (Rab5+) early endosomes during enforced waking and returned to the membrane by (Rab11+) recycling endosomes during SR. The internalization of the GluA1Rs paralleled the expression of Arc, which mediates homeostatic regulation of AMPA receptors through an endocytic pathway. The reciprocal changes in GluA1Rs relative to GABA(A)Rs suggest homeostatic down-scaling during enforced waking and sensory stimulation and restorative up-scaling during recovery sleep. Such homeostatic changes with sleep-wake states and their associated cortical activities could stabilize excitability and activity in excitatory cortical neurons.

Texture features are derived at multiple scales of resolution based on the Laplacian-of-Gaussian (LoG) filter. Three quantifier functions (Average, Standard Deviation and Entropy) are used to summarize texture statistics within standard, automatically segmented neuroanatomical regions. Significance tests are performed to identify regional texture differences between ASD vs. TDC and male vs. female groups, as well as correlations with age (corrected p < 0.05). The open-access brain imaging data exchange (ABIDE) brain MRI dataset is used to evaluate texture features derived from 31 brain regions from 1112 subjects including 573 typically developing control (TDC, 99 females, 474 males) and 539 Autism spectrum disorder (ASD, 65 female and 474 male) subjects. Statistically significant texture differences between ASD vs. TDC groups are identified asymmetrically in the right hippocampus, left choroid-plexus and corpus callosum (CC), and symmetrically in the cerebellar white matter. Sex-related texture differences in TDC subjects are found in primarily in the left amygdala, left cerebellar white matter, and brain stem. Correlations between age and texture in TDC subjects are found in the thalamus-proper, caudate and pallidum, most exhibiting bilateral symmetry.

Neurotrophic effects of progranulin in vivo in reversing motor neuron defects caused by over or under expression of TDP-43 or FUS	PLOS ONE			English	Article							FRONTOTEMPORAL LOBAR DEGENERATION; AMYOTROPHIC-LATERAL-SCLEROSIS; EMBRYONIC ZEBRAFISH; DEFICIENT MICE; NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASE; HEXANUCLEOTIDE REPEAT; AXON OUTGROWTH; KNOCKOUT MICE; GENE FAMILY; MUTATIONS	Progranulin (PGRN) is a glycoprotein with multiple roles in normal and disease states. Mutations within the GRN gene cause frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). The affected neurons display distinctive TAR DNA binding protein 43 (TDP-43) inclusions. How partial loss of PGRN causes TDP-43 neuropathology is poorly understood. TDP-43 inclusions are also found in affected neurons of patients with other neurodegenerative diseases including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Alzheimer's disease. In ALS, TDP-43 inclusions are typically also immunoreactive for fused in sarcoma (FUS). Mutations within TDP-43 or FUS are themselves neuropathogenic in ALS and some cases of FTLD. We used the outgrowth of caudal primary motor neurons (MNs) in zebrafish embryos to investigate the interaction of PGRN with TDP-43 and FUS in vivo. As reported previously, depletion of zebrafish PGRN-A (zfPGRN-A) is associated with truncated primary MNs and impaired motor function. Here we found that depletion of zfPGRN-A results in primary MNs outgrowth stalling at the horizontal myoseptum, a line of demarcation separating the myotome into dorsal and ventral compartments that is where the final destination of primary motor is assigned. Successful axonal outgrowth beyond the horizontal myoseptum depends in part upon formation of acetylcholine receptor clusters and this was found to be disorganized upon depletion of zfPGRN-A. PGRN reversed the effects of zfPGRN-A knockdown, but a related gene, zfPGRN-1, was without effect. Both knockdown of TDP-43 or FUS, as well as expression of human TDP-43 and FUS mutants results in MN abnormalities that are reversed by co-expression of hPGRN mRNA. Neither TDP-43 nor FUS reversed MN phenotypes caused by the depletion of PGRN. Thus TDP-43 and FUS lie upstream of PGRN in a gene complementation pathway. The ability of PGRN to override TDP-43 and FUS neurotoxicity due to partial loss of function or mutation in the corresponding genes may have therapeutic relevance.

J	Kasparian, K; Steinhauer, K				Kasparian, Kristina; Steinhauer, Karsten			When the Second Language Takes the Lead: Neurocognitive Processing Changes in the First Language of Adult Attriters	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						neuroplasticity; first language attrition; second language acquisition; event-related potentials; language processing; crosslinguistic influence; relative clauses; language exposure	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; SYNTACTIC AMBIGUITY RESOLUTION; REVEAL INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; RELATIVE CLAUSES; BRAIN POTENTIALS; SENTENCE COMPREHENSION; WORKING-MEMORY; TEMPORAL DYNAMICS; EYE-MOVEMENTS; L1 ATTRITION	Although research on multilingualism has revealed continued neuroplasticity for language-learning beyond what was previously expected, it remains controversial whether and to what extent a second language (L2) acquired in adulthood may induce changes in the neurocognitive processing of a first language (L1). First language (L1) attrition in adulthood offers new insight on neuroplasticity and the factors that modulate neurocognitive responses to language. To date, investigations of the neurocognitive correlates of L1 attrition and of factors influencing these mechanisms are still scarce. Moreover, most event-related-potential (ERP) studies of second language processing have focused on L1 influence on the L2, while cross-linguistic influence in the reverse direction has been underexplored. Using ERPs, we examined the real-time processing of Italian relative-clauses in 24 Italian-English adult migrants with predominant use of English since immigration and reporting attrition of their native-Italian (Attriters), compared to 30 non-attriting monolinguals in Italy (Controls). Our results showed that Attriters differed from Controls in their acceptability judgment ratings and ERP responses when relative clause constructions were ungrammatical in English, though grammatical in Italian. Controls' ERP responses to unpreferred sentence constructions were consistent with garden path effects typically observed in the literature for these complex sentences. In contrast, due to L2-English influence, Attriters were less sensitive to semantic cues than to word-order preferences, and processed permissible Italian sentences as outright morphosyntactic violations. Key factors modulating processing differences within Attriters were the degree of maintained L1 exposure, length of residence in the L2 environment and L2 proficiency -with higher levels of L2 immersion and proficiency associated with increased L2 influence on the L1. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that high levels of L2 proficiency and exposure may render a grammatical sentence in one's native language ungrammatical. These group differences strongly point to distinct processing strategies and provide evidence that even a "stabilized" L1 grammar is subject to change after a prolonged period of L2 immersion and reduced L1 use, especially in linguistic areas promoting cross-linguistic influence.

PLOS ONE			English	Article							POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; RECEPTOR AVAILABILITY; HEALTHY-ADULTS; SURFACE-AREA; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; SENSATION SEEKING; DECISION-MAKING; AMPHETAMINE; IMPULSIVITY	Background Novelty-seeking (NS) and impulsive personality traits have been proposed to reflect an interplay between fronto-cortical and limbic systems, including the limbic striatum (LS). Although neuroimaging studies have provided some evidence for this, most are comprised of small samples and many report surprisingly large effects given the challenges of trying to relate a snapshot of brain function or structure to an entity as complex as personality. The current work tested a priori hypotheses about associations between striatal dopamine (DA) release, cortical thickness (CT), and NS in a large sample of healthy adults. Methods Fifty-two healthy adults (45M/7F; age: 23.8 +/- 4.93) underwent two positron emission tomography scans with [C-11] raclopride (specific for striatal DA D2/3 receptors) with or without amphetamine (0.3 mg/kg, p.o.). Structural magnetic resonance image scans were acquired, as were Tridimensional Personality Questionnaire data. Amphetamine-induced changes in [C-11] raclopride binding potential values (Delta BPND) were examined in the limbic, sensorimotor (SMS) and associative (AST) striatum. CT measures, adjusted for whole brain volume, were extracted from the dorsolateral sensorimotor and ventromedial/limbic cortices. Results BPND values were lower in the amphetamine vs. no-drug sessions, with the largest effect in the LS. When comparing low vs. high LS Delta BPND groups (median split), higher NS2 (impulsiveness) scores were found in the high Delta BPND group. Partial correlations (age and gender as covariates) yielded a negative relation between ASTS Delta BPND and sensorimotor CT; trends for inverse associations existed between Delta BPND values in other striatal regions and frontal CT. In other words, the greater the amphetamine-induced striatal DA response, the thinner the frontal cortex. Conclusions These data expand upon previously reported associations between striatal DA release in the LS and both NS related impulsiveness and CT in the largest sample reported to date. The findings add to the plausibility of these associations while suggesting that the effects are likely weaker than has been previously proposed.

Besides its role on HIV-1 entry, the gp120 has been shown to be involved in the production of IL-1, IL-6, CCL20 and other innate response cytokines by bystander, uninfected CD4(+) T cells and monocytes. However, the gp120 determinants involved in these functions are not completely understood. Whether signalling leading to cytokine production is due to CD4 or other receptors is still unclear. Enhanced chemokine receptor binding and subsequent clustering receptors may lead to cytokine production. By using a comprehensive panel of gp120 mutants, here we show that CD4 binding is mandatory for cytokine outburst in monocytes. Our data suggest that targeting monocytes in HIV-infected patients might decrease systemic inflammation and the potential tissue injury associated with the production of inflammatory cytokines. Understanding how gp120 mediates a cytokine burst in monocytes might help develop new approaches to improve the chronic inflammation that persists in these patients despite effective suppression of viremia by antiretroviral therapy.

Passive odd ball paradigms were used with nonverbal and verbal stimuli to record cortical auditory-evoked potentials and MMN. Twenty-three children aged 9-12 participated in the study: 10 with normal hearing acuity as well as CAPD and 13 with normal hearing without CAPD. No significant group differences were observed for P1 latency and amplitude. Children with CAPD were observed to have significant N2 latency prolongation and amplitude reduction with nonverbal and verbal stimuli compared to children without CAPD. No significant group differences were observed for the MMN conditions. Moreover, electrode position affected the results in the same manner for both groups of children. The findings of the present study suggest that the N2 response could be a marker of neural deficits in children with CAPD. N2 results suggest that maturational factors or a different mechanism could be involved in processing auditory information at the central level for these children. (C) 2017 IBRO.

The netrin-1 receptor, deleted in colorectal cancer (DCC), controls the extent and organization of mPFC dopamine connectivity during adolescence and in turn directs mPFC functional and structural maturation. Dcc haploinsufficiency leads to increased mPFC dopamine input, which causes improved cognitive processing and resilience to behavioral effects of stimulant drugs of abuse. Here we examine the effects of Dcc haploinsufficiency on the dynamic expression of dopamine receptors in forebrain targets of C57BL6 mice. We conducted quantitative receptor autoradiography experiments with [H-3] SCH-23390 or [H-3] raclopride to characterize D1 and D2 receptor expression in mPFC and striatal regions in male Dcc haploinsufficient and wild-type mice. We generated autoradiograms at early adolescence (PND21 +/- 1), midadolescence (PND35 +/- 2), and adulthood (PND75 +/- 15). C57BL6 mice exhibit overexpression and pruning of D1, but not D2, receptors in striatal regions, and a lack of dopamine receptor pruning in the mPFC. We observed age-and region-specific differences in D1 and D2 receptor density between Dcc haploinsufficient and wild-type mice. Notably, neither group shows the typical pattern of mPFC dopamine receptor pruning in adolescence, but adult haploinsufficient mice show increased D2 receptor density in the mPFC. These results show that DCC receptors contribute to the dynamic refinement of D1 and D2 receptor expression in striatal regions across adolescence. The age-dependent expression of dopamine receptor in C57BL6 mice shows marked differences from previous characterizations in rats. (C) 2017 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Clinical picture is characterized by cognitive impairment associated with a broad spectrum of psychiatric comorbidities including autism spectrum disorders and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorders. Some of these disorders have been associated with lipid abnormalities and lower cholesterol levels. Since lipids are important for neuronal development, we aim to investigate the lipid profile of French Canadian-FXS individuals and to identify the altered components of cholesterol metabolism as well as their association with clinical profile. Methods Anthropometric data were collected from 25 FXS individuals and 26 controls. Lipid assessment included: total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides, LDL, HDL, ApoB, ApoA1, PCSK9, Lp(a) and lipoprotein electrophoresis. Aberrant and adaptive behaviour of affected individuals was respectively assessed by the ABC-C and ABAS questionnaires. Results FXS participants had a higher body mass index as compared to controls while 38% of them had TC< 10th percentile. Lower levels of LDL, HDL and apoA1 were observed in FXS group as compared to controls. However, PCSK9 levels did not differ between the two groups. As expected, PCSK9 levels correlated with total cholesterol (r(s) = 0.61, p = 0.001) and LDL (r(s) = 0.46, p = 0.014) in the control group, while no association was present in the FXS group. An inverse relationship was observed between total cholesterol and aberrant behaviour as determined by ABC-C total score. Conclusion Our results showed the presence of hypocholesterolemia in French Canadian-FXS population, a condition that seems to influence their clinical phenotype. We identified for the first time a potential underlying alteration of PCSK9 function in FXS that could result from the absence of FMRP. Further investigations are warranted to better understand the association between cholesterol metabolism, PCSK9, FMRP and clinical profile.

Increased Evoked Potentials to Arousing Auditory Stimuli during Sleep: Implication for the Understanding of Dream Recall	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						EEG; dreaming; awakenings; arousals; sleep; oddball paradigm	SLOW-WAVE SLEEP; K-COMPLEX; EYE-MOVEMENTS; NREM SLEEP; REM-SLEEP; EEG; FREQUENCY; DEPRIVATION; SPINDLE; MODEL	High dream recallers (HR) show a larger brain reactivity to auditory stimuli during wakefulness and sleep as compared to low dream recallers (LR) and also more intrasleep wakefulness (ISW), but no other modification of the sleep macrostructure. To further understand the possible causal link between brain responses, ISW and dream recall, we investigated the sleep microstructure of HR and LR, and tested whether the amplitude of auditory evoked potentials (AEPs) was predictive of arousing reactions during sleep. Participants (18 HR, 18 LR) were presented with sounds during a whole night of sleep in the lab and polysomnographic data were recorded. Sleep microstructure (arousals, rapid eye movements (REMs), muscle twitches (MTs), spindles, KCs) was assessed using visual, semi-automatic and automatic validated methods. AEPs to arousing (awakenings or arousals) and non-arousing stimuli were subsequently computed. No between-group difference in the microstructure of sleep was found. In N2 sleep, auditory arousing stimuli elicited a larger parieto-occipital positivity and an increased late frontal negativity as compared to non-arousing stimuli. As compared to LR, HR showed more arousing stimuli and more long awakenings, regardless of the sleep stage but did not show more numerous or longer arousals. These results suggest that the amplitude of the brain response to stimuli during sleep determine subsequent awakening and that awakening duration (and not arousal) is the critical parameter for dream recall. Notably, our results led us to propose that the minimum necessary duration of an awakening during sleep for a successful encoding of dreams into long-term memory is approximately 2 min.

However, it remains elusive whether pharmacological manipulations of cholinergic neurotransmission enhance complex visual processing in healthy individuals. To test this hypothesis, we randomly administered either the cholinergic transmission enhancer donepezil (DPZ; 5 mg P.O.) or placebo (lactose) to young adults (n = 17) 3 h before each session of the three-dimensional (3D) multiple object tracking (3D-MOT) task. This multi-focal attention task evaluates perceptual-cognitive learning over five sessions conducted 7 days apart. A significant amount of learning was observed in the DPZ group but not the placebo group in the fourth session. In the fifth session, this learning effect was observed in both groups. Furthermore, preliminary results for a subgroup of participants (n = 9) 4-14 months later suggested the cholinergic enhancement effect was long lasting. On the other hand, DPZ had no effect on basic visual processing as measured by a motion and orientation discrimination task performed as an independent one-time, pre-post drug study without placebo control (n = 10). The results support the construct that cholinergic enhancement facilitates the encoding of a highly demanding perceptual-cognitive task although there were no significant drug effects on the performance levels compared to placebo.

Methods: Patients with idiopathic PD, recruited from a movement disorder clinic, underwent overnight polysomnography. OSA was defined as an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) >= 15/h. PD severity was assessed using the Hoehn & Yahr (H&Y) scale and the Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS). NMS were assessed using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), Fatigue Severity Scale, Apathy Scale, Beck Depression Inventory, Hospital Depression and Anxiety Scale, and PD sleep Scale. Results: Sixty-seven patients (61.2% male), mean age 64.4 (SD 9.9) years and motor MDSUPDRS 21.9 (12.6) using levodopa equivalent dose (LED) 752.4 (714.6) mg/d, were studied. OSA occurred in 47 patients (61.6%, mean AHI 27.1/h, SD 20.2/h), and NMS in 57 patients (85%).ESS and MoCA were associated with the AHI (ESS beta = 0.0670, p= 0.031; MoCA beta = 20.0520, p = 0.043, adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, LED, and H&Y). ESS was associated with respiratory arousals ( beta = 0.1015, p = 0.011) and intermittent hypoxemia (beta = 0.1470, p = 0.006). MoCA was negatively associated with respiratory arousals ( beta = 20.0596, p = 0.049) but not intermittent hypoxemia. Conclusions: OSA is associated with sleepiness and cognitive dysfunction in PD, suggesting that OSA may be a reversible contributor to these NMS. Further studies will be required to evaluate whether OSA treatment can improve excessive sleepiness and cognitive dysfunction in PD.

Correlated variability modifies working memory fidelity in primate prefrontal neuronal ensembles	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						working memory; prefrontal cortex; noise correlations; macaque; decoding	POSTERIOR PARIETAL CORTEX; PERSISTENT ACTIVITY; NEURAL VARIABILITY; VISUAL-CORTEX; MACAQUE; INFORMATION; MODEL; ORGANIZATION; DISCHARGES; ATTENTION	Neurons in the primate lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) encode working memory (WM) representations via sustained firing, a phenomenon hypothesized to arise from recurrent dynamics within ensembles of interconnected neurons. Here, we tested this hypothesis by using microelectrode arrays to examine spike count correlations (r(sc)) in LPFC neuronal ensembles during a spatial WM task. We found a pattern of pairwise r(sc) during WM maintenance indicative of stronger coupling between similarly tuned neurons and increased inhibition between dissimilarly tuned neurons. We then used a linear decoder to quantify the effects of the high-dimensional rsc structure on information coding in the neuronal ensembles. We found that the rsc structure could facilitate or impair coding, depending on the size of the ensemble and tuning properties of its constituent neurons. A simple optimization procedure demonstrated that near-maximum decoding performance could be achieved using a relatively small number of neurons. These WM-optimized subensembles were more signal correlation (r(signal))-diverse and anatomically dispersed than predicted by the statistics of the full recorded population of neurons, and they often contained neurons that were poorly WM-selective, yet enhanced coding fidelity by shaping the ensemble's rsc structure. We observed a pattern of r(sc) between LPFC neurons indicative of recurrent dynamics as a mechanism for WM-related activity and that the r(sc) structure can increase the fidelity of WM representations. Thus, WM coding in LPFC neuronal ensembles arises from a complex synergy between single neuron coding properties and multidimensional, ensemblelevel phenomena.

Stimulus background influences phase invariant coding by correlated neural activity	ELIFE			English	Article							WEAKLY ELECTRIC FISH; APTERONOTUS-LEPTORHYNCHUS; ELECTROSENSORY NEURONS; COMMUNICATION SIGNALS; TEMPORAL INTEGRATION; CHIRPING BEHAVIOR; NATURAL STIMULI; VISUAL-CORTEX; SPIKE TRAINS; NERVE-FIBERS	Previously we reported that correlations between the activities of peripheral afferents mediate a phase invariant representation of natural communication stimuli that is refined across successive processing stages thereby leading to perception and behavior in the weakly electric fish Apteronotus leptorhynchus (Metzen et al., 2016). Here, we explore how phase invariant coding and perception of natural communication stimuli are affected by changes in the sinusoidal background over which they occur. We found that increasing background frequency led to phase locking, which decreased both detectability and phase invariant coding. Correlated afferent activity was a much better predictor of behavior as assessed from both invariance and detectability than single neuron activity. Thus, our results provide not only further evidence that correlated activity likely determines perception of natural communication signals, but also a novel explanation as to why these preferentially occur on top of low frequency as well as low-intensity sinusoidal backgrounds.

Because the pathological alterations are predominantly probed using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), many questions about the electrophysiological bases of resting-state alterations in psychiatric disorders, particularly among mood disorder patients, remain unanswered. Alongside important research using electroencephalography (EEG), the specific recent contributions and future promise of magnetoencephalography (MEG) in this field are not fully recognized and valued. Here, we provide a critical review of recent findings from MEG resting-state connectivity within major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar disorder (BD). The clinical MEG resting-state results are compared with those previously reported with fMRI and EEG. Taken together, MEG appears to be a promising but still critically underexploited technique to unravel the neurophysiological mechanisms that mediate abnormal (both hyper- and hypo-) connectivity patterns involved in MDD and BD. In particular, a major strength of MEG is its ability to provide source-space estimations of neuromagnetic long-range rhythmic synchronization at various frequencies (i.e., oscillatory coupling). The reviewed literature highlights the relevance of probing local and interregional rhythmic synchronization to explore the pathophysiological underpinnings of each disorder. However, before we can fully take advantage of MEG connectivity analyses in psychiatry, several limitations inherent to MEG connectivity analyses need to be understood and taken into account. Thus, we also discuss current methodological challenges and outline paths for future research. MEG resting-state studies provide an important window onto perturbed spontaneous oscillatory brain networks and hence supply an important complement to fMRI-based resting-state measurements in psychiatric populations.
