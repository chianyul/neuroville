Our purpose was to map limbic network organization in TLE and to statistically relate it to neocortical atrophy. We performed MRI-based cortical thickness analysis in 110 TLE patients (including 68 patients with hippocampal atrophy and 42 patients with normal hippocampal volume) and 46 healthy controls. Limbic connectivity was statistically inferred by correlating mean thickness of the entorhinal cortex (EC) with thickness at each vertex across the entire neocortex. The EC was chosen as seed region since it is the link between the neocortex and the hippocampal formation. Patients showed cortical thinning mainly in temporal and fronto-central neocortices, with a prevalence of atrophy ill Lip to 35%. In controls, EC networks corresponded closely to known anatomical connections. In TLE the pattern of correlations was similar to controls, suggesting that pathological processes in the EC affect the same networks that co-vary with the EC in the healthy brain. Nevertheless, we found decreases in correlations mainly in the temporal lobe and increases mainly in orbitofrontal cortices. Although our analysis indicated alterations in the temporo-limbic network in TLE, there was no association between mesiotemporal connectivity and atrophy across the entire Cortical Surface. This divergence underlines the complexity of the pathophysiological mechanisms leading to neocortical atrophy in TLE. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

However, DTI is limited in representing complex white matter architecture, notably in the presence of crossing fibres. Recently, q-ball imaging (QBI) has been proposed as a new method for recovering complex white matter architecture. We applied this technique to both e-v vivo and in vivo spinal cords of cats using a 3T scanner. For the purpose of comparison, gradients have been applied in 55 and 100 encoding directions and b-values varied from 800 to 3000 s/mm(2). As a result, QBI was able to retrieve crossing fibre information, where the DTI approach vas constrained in a unique diffusion direction. To our knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating the benefits of QBI for detecting the presence of longitudinal, commissural and dorso-ventral fibres in the spinal cord. It is a First step towards in vivo characterization of the healthy and injured human spinal cord using high angular resolution diffusion imaging and QBI. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Several lines of evidence indicate that 5HT(1A) receptors exert a negative feedback in the synthesis and release of serotonin. While most of what is known about serotonin comes from studies in animals, much less empirical evidence exists about the serotonergic system in the living human brain. This study aims to assess the correlation between serotonin synthesis and 5-HT(1A) receptor binding using positron emission tomography (PET) in humans. Six healthy male volunteers underwent 2 PET scans in the same day: one measuring alpha-[(11)C] MT K* [ml/g/min] trapping constant (a measure of serotonin synthesis) and one measuring 5-HT(1A) receptor binding potential BP(ND) with [(18)F]MPPF. Volumes of interest (VOIs) selected a priori included: anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), anterior insula, hippocampus, amygdala, thalamus, hypothalamus and midbrain raphe nuclei. Correlation analyses were Conducted voxel-by-voxel and with manually traced VOIs. A significant negative correlation between serotonin synthesis and 5-HT(1A) binding potential was found bilaterally in hippocampus and anterior insula and in the left ACC. The combination of [(18)F]MPPF and alpha-[(11)C]MT PET offers a means to investigate key determinants of 5-HT neurotransmission Under physiological and psychopathological conditions in the human brain in vivo.

Such redundancy is frequently associated with either contours or textures within images. In this study we use fMRI to evaluate how the total amount of contrast-energy contained in contours and textures within natural images affect responses in Visual cortex. We used both the entire natural image and parts of it containing predominantly contour or texture information. We modified these natural images in order to match other image properties that are known to affect cortical responses as closely as possible. These modified natural images, i.e. pseudo-natural images, remain highly recognizable. We also used synthetic images without recognizable content but with closely matched image properties. We report that most of the primary visual cortex (VI) signal variations are explained by the total amount of contrast-energy in the images. Extra-striate visual cortex, on the other hand, is driven strongest by images containing sparsely distributed contours: independent of contrast-energy amount or recognizable image content. These results provide evidence for an initial representation Of natural images in VI based on local oriented filters. Later visual cortex (and to a modest degree V1) incorporates a facilitation Of contour-based structure and suppressive interactions that effectively amplify sparse-contour information within natural images.

Impaired empathy is one of the core diagnostic features of psychopathic personality disorder. In the present study, we investigated whether psychopathic personality traits in a non-psychiatric sample were related to MNS function. Healthy participants viewed short videos known to activate the sensorimotor MNS for pain (a needle penetrating a human hand) while transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)-induced motor evoked potentials (MEP) were recorded as a measure of motor cortex excitability. Individual psychopathic personality traits were assessed using the Psychopathic Personality Inventory (PPI) and correlated with the MEP findings. Consistent with previous data, observation of the painful stimulus was associated with a significant reduction in the amplitude of the TMS-induced MEP. Interestingly, the level of corticospinal excitability modulation was positively correlated with individual scores on the coldheartedness subscale of the PPI, such that individuals with the greatest MEP reduction were the ones scoring highest on the coldheartedness measure. These data suggest the existence of a functional link between 'motor empathy' and psychopathy. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, navigation is not process-pure, as manifold learning components contribute to performance, notably the spatial and contextual memory constituents. In this context, it remains unclear whether post-training sleep globally promotes consolidation of all of the memory components embedded in virtual navigation, or rather favors the development of specific representations. Here, we investigated the effect of post-training sleep on the neural substrates of the consolidation of spatial and contextual memories acquired while navigating in a complex 3D, naturalistic virtual town. Using fMRI, we mapped regional cerebral activity during various tasks designed to tap either the spatial or the contextual memory component, or both, 72 h after encoding with or without sleep deprivation during the first post-training night. Behavioral performance was not dependent upon post-training sleep deprivation, neither in a natural setting that engages both spatial and contextual memory processes nor when looking more specifically at each of these memory representations. At the neuronal level however, analyses that focused on contextual memory revealed distinct correlations between performance and neuronal activity in frontal areas associated with recollection processes after post-training sleep, and in the parahippocampal gyrus associated with familiarity processes in sleep-deprived participants. Likewise, efficient spatial memory was associated with posterior cortical activity after sleep whereas it correlated with parahippocampal/medial temporal activity after sleep deprivation. Finally, variations in place-finding efficiency in a natural setting encompassing spatial and contextual elements were associated with caudate activity after post-training sleep, suggesting the automation of navigation. These data indicate that post-training sleep modulates the neural substrates of the consolidation of both the spatial and contextual memories acquired during virtual navigation.

After defining the keywords ( prevention, chronic and physical aggression), a selected review of published studies is used to answer the following four questions: when should we attempt to prevent onset of CPA? What are the risk factors for CPA? Have early childhood interventions been shown to prevent CPA? Can early preventive interventions benefit from epigenetic studies? The last section of this paper gives two examples of experimental prevention designs that integrate present knowledge of CPA development, risk factors, early childhood preventive interventions and epigenetic programming of brain development during pregnancy and early childhood. I conclude that randomized control trials of preventive interventions during pregnancy and early childhood with a specific focus on epigenetic effects are the research design most likely to advance our understanding of the biopsychosocial mechanisms that lead to CPA, and the only research design that can identify effective interventions for preventing the development of CPA.

Despite a wealth of possible functions, the mechanisms underlying synchrony are still poorly understood. In particular, in vitro preparations have demonstrated synchronization with no apparent periodicity, which cannot be explained by simple oscillatory mechanisms. Here, we investigate the possible origins of nonperiodic synchronization through biophysical simulations. We show that such aperiodic synchronization arises naturally under a simple set of plausible assumptions, depending crucially on heterogeneous cell properties. In addition, nonperiodicity occurs even in the absence of stochastic fluctuation in membrane potential, suggesting that it may represent an intrinsic property of interconnected networks. Simulations capture some of the key aspects of population- level synchronization in spontaneous network spikes ( NSs) and suggest that the intrinsic nonperiodicity of NSs observed in reduced cell preparations is a phenomenon that is highly robust and can be reproduced in simulations that involve a minimal set of realistic assumptions. In addition, a model with spike timing- dependent plasticity can overcome a natural tendency to exhibit nonperiodic behavior. After rhythmic stimulation, the model does not automatically fall back to a state of nonperiodic behavior, but keeps replaying the pattern of evoked NSs for a few cycles. A cluster analysis of synaptic strengths highlights the importance of population- wide interactions in generating this result and describes a possible route for encoding temporal patterns in networks of neurons.

J	Lugo, E; Doti, R; Faubert, J				Lugo, Eduardo; Doti, Rafael; Faubert, Jocelyn			Ubiquitous Crossmodal Stochastic Resonance in Humans: Auditory Noise Facilitates Tactile, Visual and Proprioceptive Sensations	PLOS ONE			English	Article								Background: Stochastic resonance is a nonlinear phenomenon whereby the addition of noise can improve the detection of weak stimuli. An optimal amount of added noise results in the maximum enhancement, whereas further increases in noise intensity only degrade detection or information content. The phenomenon does not occur in linear systems, where the addition of noise to either the system or the stimulus only degrades the signal quality. Stochastic Resonance (SR) has been extensively studied in different physical systems. It has been extended to human sensory systems where it can be classified as unimodal, central, behavioral and recently crossmodal. However what has not been explored is the extension of this crossmodal SR in humans. For instance, if under the same auditory noise conditions the crossmodal SR persists among different sensory systems. Methodology/Principal Findings: Using physiological and psychophysical techniques we demonstrate that the same auditory noise can enhance the sensitivity of tactile, visual and propioceptive system responses to weak signals. Specifically, we show that the effective auditory noise significantly increased tactile sensations of the finger, decreased luminance and contrast visual thresholds and significantly changed EMG recordings of the leg muscles during posture maintenance. Conclusions/Significance: We conclude that crossmodal SR is a ubiquitous phenomenon in humans that can be interpreted within an energy and frequency model of multisensory neurons spontaneous activity. Initially the energy and frequency content of the multisensory neurons' activity (supplied by the weak signals) is not enough to be detected but when the auditory noise enters the brain, it generates a general activation among multisensory neurons of different regions, modifying their original activity.

An ApoD homologous gene in Drosophila, Glial Lazarillo, regulates resistance to stress, and neurodegeneration in the aging brain. Here we study for the first time the protective potential of ApoD in a vertebrate model organism. Loss of mouse ApoD function increases the sensitivity to oxidative stress and the levels of brain lipid peroxidation, and impairs locomotor and learning abilities. Human ApoD overexpression in the mouse brain produces opposite effects, increasing survival and preventing the raise of brain lipid peroxides after oxidant treatment. These observations, together with its transcriptional up-regulation in the brain upon oxidative insult, identify ApoD as an acute response protein with a protective and therefore beneficial function mediated by the control of peroxidated lipids.

Unlike aphasia due to stroke, in which the association between particular aphasia profiles and insight has been well characterized, this relationship has not been investigated in PPA. Reduced insight is seen in other neurological conditions, but tends to involve right hemisphere damage, whereas PPA is predominantly a left hemisphere disorder. The aim of the current study was to examine whether fluent aphasia with less meaningful speech, is also associated with diminished insight in stroke, is also characteristic of PPA patients with reduced insight. Fourten PPA patients were studied. Results indicated that reduced information content in speech and poor performace on a nonlanguage test, the Pyramids and Palm Trees test, predicted insight. This study has implications for the anatomical network in insight and clinical implications in terms of selecting interventions apporpriate for individual patients with PPA.

P-gp overexpression in MDCK-MDR cells was correlated with enhanced cell migration whereas treatment with P-gp inhibitors CsA OF PSC833 reduced it. Transfection of RBE4 rat brain endothelial cells with mutated versions of MDR1, in the caveolin-1 interaction motif, decreased the interaction between P-gp and caveolin-1, enhanced P-gp transport activity and cell migration. Moreover, down-regulation of caveolin-1 in RBE4 cells by siRNA against caveolin-1 stimulated cell migration. Interestingly, the inhibition of P-gp/caveolin-1 interaction increased also EC tubulogenesis. Furthermore, decrease of P-gp expression by siRNA inhibited EC tubulogenesis. These data indicate that the level of P-gp/caveolin-1 interaction can modulate brain endothelial angiogenesis and P gp dependent cell migration. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Different structures involved during ictal and interictal epileptic activity in malformations of cortical development: an EEG-fMRI study	BRAIN			English	Article						malformation of cortical development; EEG; functional MRI; epileptogenesis; seizure	PERIVENTRICULAR NODULAR HETEROTOPIA; SUBCORTICAL BAND HETEROTOPIA; NEURONAL MIGRATION DISORDERS; TRIGGERED FUNCTIONAL MRI; TEMPORAL-LOBE EPILEPSY; CEREBRAL-BLOOD-FLOW; DOUBLE CORTEX; TIME-SERIES; INTRINSIC EPILEPTOGENICITY; INTRACTABLE EPILEPSY	Malformations of cortical development (MCDs) are commonly complicated by intractable focal epilepsy. Epileptogenesis in these disorders is not well understood and may depend on the type of MCD. The cellular mechanisms involved in interictal and ictal events are notably different, and could be influenced independently by the type of pathology. We evaluated the relationship between interictal and ictal zones in eight patients with different types of MCD in order to better understand the generation of these activities: four had nodular heterotopia, two focal cortical dysplasia and two subcortical band heterotopia (double-cortex). We used the non-invasive EEG-fMRI technique to record simultaneously all cerebral structures with a high spatio-temporal resolution. We recorded interictal and ictal events during the same session. Ictal events were either electrical only or clinical with minimal motion. BOLD changes were found in the focal cortical dysplasia during interictal and ictal epileptiform events in the two patients with this disorder. Heterotopic and normal cortices were involved in BOLD changes during interictal and ictal events in the two patients with double cortex, but the maximum BOLD response was in the heterotopic band in both patients. Only two of the four patients with nodular heterotopia showed involvement of a nodule during interictal activity. During seizures, although BOLD changes affected the lesion in two patients, the maximum was always in the overlying cortex and never in the heterotopia. For two patients intracranial recordings were available and confirm our findings. The dysplastic cortex and the heterotopic cortex of band heterotopia were involved in interictal and seizure processes. Even if the nodular gray matter heterotopia may have the cellular substrate to produce interictal events, the often abnormal overlying cortex is more likely to be involved during the seizures. The non-invasive BOLD study of interictal and ictal events in MCD patients may help to understand the role of the lesion in epileptogenesis and also determine the potential surgical target.

The dual morphological character of these DA innervations has led to the suggestion that the meso-telencephalic DA system operates by diffuse (or volume) as well as by classical synaptic transmission. In the last decade, electrophysiological and neurochemical evidence has also accumulated indicating that monoamine neurons in various parts of the CNS, and particularly the mesencephalic DA neurons, might release glutamate as a co-transmitter. Following the identification of the vesicular transporters for glutamate (VGluT), in situ hybridization and RT-PCR studies carried out on isolated neurons or standard tissue cultures, and more recently in vivo, have shown that VGluT2 mRNA may be expressed in a significant proportion of mesencephalic DA neurons, at least in the ventral tegmental area. A current study also suggests that the co-expression of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and VGluT2 by these neurons is regulated during embryonic development, and may be derepressed or reactivated postnatally following their partial destruction by neonatal administration of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA). In both 15 day-old and adult rats subjected or not to the neonatal 6-OHDA lesion, concurrent electron microscopic examination of the nucleus accumbens after dual immunocytochemical labeling for TH and VGluT2 reveals the co-existence of the two proteins in a significant proportion of these axon terminals. Moreover, all TH varicosities which co-localize VGluT2 are synaptic, as if there was a link between the potential of DA axon terminals to release glutamate and their establishment of synaptic junctions. Together with the RT-PCR and in situ hybridization data demonstrating the co-localization of TH and VGluT2 mRNA in mesencephalic neurons of the VTA, these observations raise a number of fundamental questions regarding the functioning of the meso-telencephalic DA system in healthy or diseased brain.

Principal components analyses (PCA) of the genetic correlation matrix indicated a single factor accounting for over 60% of the genetic variability in cortical thickness. When covaried for mean global cortical thickness, PCA, cluster analyses, and graph models identified genetically mediated fronto-parietal and occipital networks. Graph theoretical models suggest that the observed genetically mediated relationships follow small world architectural rules. These findings are largely concordant with other multivariate studies of brain structure and function, the twin literature, and current understanding on the role of genes in cortical neurodevelopment.

Building on that literature, the term "Healing Ties" refers to the scientific and popular factors supporting the idea that relationships and community are essential for healing. However, difficulties arise in assessing the effect of social Support for survivorship. The Current paper reviews the role in survivorship of social Support, with respect to the explanatory model provided by neuro-oncology and psycho-neuro-immunology. Taking cognizance of the importance of social relationships, the model of cancer rehabilitation aims, through its interdisciplinary framework, to restore a sense of well-being and to facilitate healing by optimizing the capability for full social relationships and engagement with the world.

In addition, using a variety of motor sequential paradigms in groups of patients affected by a movement disorder, major advances have been achieved in our understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying Parkinson's and Huntington's diseases, as well as primary forms of dystonia. Recent findings This review begins by describing the latest findings in normal participants with regards to the dynamic alterations in neural networks observed across the different phases of motor sequence learning. It then focuses on the hotly debated issue of motor memory consolidation, highlighting the results of novel studies that investigated the role of both day and night sleep, the neural substrates and the developmental evolution mediating this process. Finally, this paper addresses current work looking at motor sequence learning in movement disorders that helps to better comprehend the functional contribution of basal ganglia structures to this type of memory, to assess the impact of such diseases on related patterns of brain activation, as well as to identify the neuronal compensatory mechanisms educed by these basal ganglia disorders. Summary Such advances have major implications, not only for optimizing ways to learn new skilled behaviors in real-life situations, but also for guiding therapeutic approaches in patients with movement disorders.

In the CDB, all doses of GA (25,50 and 100 mg/kg, PO) decreased the global score of anxiety and the latency of the first approach towards the probe after shock, in a similar way to diazepam (DZP) at the dose of 3 mg/kg, PO. But unlike DZP, the latency before touching again the probe after shock was not significantly reduced by GA. In the FST the two higher doses of GA (15 and 45 mg/kg PO) reduced immobility time in a similar way to imipramine (IMI) at the dose of 20 mg/hg, PO. But unlike IMI, GA did not reduce open-field activity and, unlike DZA did not cause a place preference to develop. These results indicate the potential anxiolytic- and antidepressant-like properties of GA in the absence of any change in cerebral activation and dependence. These psychotropic properties of GA may be due to the synergistic action of its active constituents.

J	Ouellet, J; Li, SL; Roy, R				Ouellet, Jimmy; Li, Shaolin; Roy, Richard			Notch signalling is required for both dauer maintenance and recovery in C-elegans	DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						C. elegans; notch; dauer; neurons; insulin; like signalling	LONG-TERM-MEMORY; CAENORHABDITIS-ELEGANS; LARVAL DEVELOPMENT; NERVOUS-SYSTEM; CHEMOSENSORY NEURONS; SEL-12 PRESENILIN; FORKHEAD DOMAIN; KNOCKOUT MICE; GENE FAMILY; CELL FATES	The Notch signalling pathway is conserved among higher metazoans and is used repeatedly throughout development to specify distinct cell fates among populations of equipotent cells. Mounting evidence suggests that Notch signalling may also be crucial in neuronal function in postmitotic, differentiated neurons. Here, we demonstrate a novel role for the canonical Notch signalling pathway in postmitotic neurons during a specialised 'diapause-like' post-embryonic developmental stage in C. elegans called dauer. Our data suggest that cell signalling downstream of the developmental decision to enter dauer leads to the activation of Notch-responding genes in postmitotic neurons. Consistent with this, we demonstrate that glp-1, one of the two C. elegans Notch receptors, and its ligand lag-2 are expressed in neurons during the dauer stage, and both genes are required to maintain this stage in a daf-7/TGF beta dauer constitutive background. Our genetic data also suggest that a second Notch receptor, lin-12, functions upstream of, or in parallel with, insulin-like signalling components in response to replete growth conditions to promote dauer recovery. Based on our findings, cues associated with the onset of dauer ultimately trigger a glp-1-dependent Notch signalling cascade in neurons to maintain this developmental state. Then, as growth conditions improve, activation of the LIN-12 Notch receptor cooperates with the insulin-like signalling pathway to signal recovery from the dauer stage.

Indian hedgehog signaling from endothelial cells is required for sclera and retinal pigment epithelium development in the mouse eye	DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY			English	Article						choroid; hedgehog; patched; endothelium; sclera; differentiation; condensation; mesenchyme; neural crest; retina	LEFT-RIGHT ASYMMETRY; NEURAL CREST CELLS; SONIC HEDGEHOG; ZEBRAFISH RETINA; HOMEOBOX GENE; IN-VITRO; PHOTORECEPTOR DIFFERENTIATION; REGULATES PROLIFERATION; GANGLION-CELLS; GROWTH-FACTORS	The development of extraocular orbital structures, in particular the choroid and sclera, is regulated by a complex series of interactions between neuroectoderm, neural crest and mesoderm derivatives, although in many instances the signals that mediate these interactions are not known. In this study we have investigated the function of Indian hedgehog (Ihh) in the developing mammalian eye. We show that Ihh is expressed in a population of non-pigmented cells located in the developing choroid adjacent to the RPE. The analysis of Hh mutant mice demonstrates that the RPE and developing scleral mesenchyme are direct targets of lhh signaling and that Ihh is required for the normal pigmentation pattern of the RPE and the condensation of mesenchymal cells to form the sclera. Our findings also indicate that Ihh signals indirectly to promote proliferation and photoreceptor specification in the neural retina. This study identifies lhh as a novel choroid-derived signal that regulates RPE, sclera and neural retina development. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Indeed, receptors, transporters and glutamate itself are present at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) while glutamate activation of metabotropic receptors (mGluRs) decreases synaptic transmission and mediates depression through presynaptic mechanisms. However, we have shown that the mGluRs are located postsynaptically, inconsistent with the presynaptic action of glutamate. In the present study, we tested whether nitric oxide (NO) serves as a retrograde messenger mediating the distant effect of glutamate. Glutamate or an mGluR agonist [trans-(1S,3R)-aminocyclopentanedicarboxylic acid (ACPD)] failed to reduce synaptic transmission in the presence of an NOS inhibitor (3Br7NINa, 3-bromo-7-nitroindazole sodium salt). Moreover, application of 3Br7NINa precluded the effect of the mGluR antagonist MCPG [(S)-alpha-methyl-4-carboxyphenylglycine] on high-frequency-induced synaptic depression. Iontophoretic injections of BAPTA [1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N'-tetraacetic acid] in muscle fibres abolished the effect of trans-ACPD on synaptic transmission and blocked the mGluR component of depression, indicating the involvement of muscular calcium in mGluR-induced depression. Also, the use of this protocol unveiled a muscular calcium-dependent potentiating pathway dependent on cyclo-oxygenase activity. In addition, local application of trans-ACPD induced an increase in NO production by muscle fibres visualized with the indicator DAF-FM (4-amino-5-methylamino-2',7'-difluorofluorescein). This was prevented by 3Br7NINa or the iontophoretic injection of BAPTA. Moreover, motor nerve stimulation (50 Hz, 30 s) induced an increase in DAF-FM fluorescence that was abolished by 3Br7NINa and MCPG. Hence, the data suggest that the production of the retrograde molecule NO depends on the postsynaptic calcium-dependent activation of nitric oxide synthase following mGluRs stimulation and is essential for the glutamatergic modulation of synaptic efficacy and plasticity at the NMJ.

It has been shown that serotonin (5-HT) modulates sensory transmission. This study examines in lampreys the effects of 5-HT on sensory transmission to brainstem reticulospinal (RS) neurons and the distribution of 5-HT cells that innervate RS cells. Cells were recorded intracellularly in the in vitro isolated brainstem of larval lampreys. Trigeminal nerve stimulation elicited disynaptic excitatory responses in RS neurons, and bath application of 5-HT reduced the response amplitude with maximum effect at 10 mu M. Local ejection of 5-HT either onto the RS cells or onto the relay cells decreased sensory-evoked excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) in RS cells. The monosynaptic EPSPs elicited from stimulation of the relay cells were also reduced by 5-HT. The reduction was maintained after blocking either N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) or alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid (AMPA) receptors. The local ejection of glutamate over RS cells elicited excitatory responses that were only slightly depressed by 5-HT. In addition, 5-HT increased the threshold for eliciting sustained depolarizations in response to trigeminal nerve stimulation but did not prevent them. Combined 5-HT immunofluorescence with axonal tracing revealed that the 5-HT innervation of RS neurons of the middle rhombencephalic reticular nucleus comes mainly from neurons in the isthmic region, but also from neurons located in the pretectum and caudal rhombencephalon. Our results indicate that 5-HT modulates sensory transmission to lamprey brainstem RS cells.

Autobiographical memory was studied in patients with unilateral excisions restricted to the frontal cortex or temporal lobe involving the amygdalo-hippocampal region and in normal controls using an event-sampling method. We examined accuracy of free recall, use of strategies during retrieval and memory for specific aspects of the autobiographical events, including temporal order. Patients with temporal lobe excisions were impaired in autobiographical recall. By contrast, patients with frontal cortical excisions exhibited normal autobiographical recall but were less likely to use temporal order spontaneously to organize event retrieval. Instruction to organize retrieval by temporal order failed to improve recall in temporal lobe patients and increased the incidence of plausible intrusion errors in left temporal patients. In contrast, patients with frontal cortical excisions now surpassed control subjects in recall of autobiographical events. Furthermore, the retrieval accuracy for the temporal order of diary events was not impaired in these patients. In a subsequent cued recall test, temporal lobe patients were impaired in their memory for the details of the diary events and their context. In conclusion, a basic impairment in autobiographical memory (including memory for temporal context) results from damage to the temporal lobe and not the frontal cortex. Patients with frontal excisions fail to use organizational strategies spontaneously to aid retrieval but can use these effectively if instructed to do so.

It is shared by all ocular reflexes including the vestibuloocular reflex (VOR). It has been widely accepted that the NI acts as a "perfect" integrator even in the dark with time constants as large as 1950s. However, the NI time constant is often less than ideal and its value can also be dependent on context [W. W. P. Chan and H. L. Galiana, "Integrator function in the oculomotor system is dependent on sensory context," J. Neurophysiol., vol. 93, pp. 3709-3717, Feb. 2005.]. In this paper, a nonlinear feedback model is postulated to model the context-dependent properties of the NI. Algorithms are first developed and validated to fit both linear and nonlinear NI models to experimental data in the presence of ocular nystagmus. Preliminary results indicate that even normal subjects can have a nonlinear VOR and NI.	[Chan, Wilbur W.

J	Noiseux, S; Ricard, N				Noiseux, Sylvie; Ricard, Nicole			Recovery as perceived by people with schizophrenia, family members and health professionals: A grounded theory	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NURSING STUDIES			English	Article						schizophrenia; recovery; grounded theory; human responses; nursing theory	MIDDLE-RANGE THEORY; LONG-TERM COURSE; MENTAL-ILLNESS; PSYCHIATRIC DISABILITIES; FOLLOW-UP; HOSPITALIZATION; PSYCHOSIS; KNOWLEDGE; FRAMEWORK; BIOLOGY	Background: Advances in knowledge in the biomedical and psychosocial sciences have expanded our understanding of schizophrenia and of how it evolves in people living with it. These individuals are no longer viewed as being 'ill' and requiring long-term hospitalisation. We have come instead to have a much more positive view of them and of the role they can play in coming to terms both with their health condition and with society. In the majority of cases, schizophrenia sufferers have the potential to recover. Aims: The purpose of this study is to propose a theoretical explanation of recovery based on the concept of human responses put forward by the American Nurses' Association. Participants: Data were collected from 41 participants (16 people living with schizophrenia, 5 family members, 20 health professionals). Selection criteria required the people living with schizophrenia to be in stable health, see themselves as being in the process of recovery, and be able to speak about it. Family members were expected to have displayed a strong bond with their relative living with schizophrenia, and the health professionals to have had at least 3 years experience dealing with schizophrenia patients. Method: The Grounded Theory approach was selected because it allows for diversified data sources to be used in the empirical study of a phenomenon. It is an appropriate approach for the conceptualisation of complex phenomena and the development of middle-range theory. To ensure a variety of subjects were involved, semi-structured interviews were conducted in three different settings: a specialised. psychiatric hospital, a self-help group, and a community setting. Findings: Seven categories emerged from the analysis and conceptualisation: perceiving schizophrenia as a 'descent into hell'; igniting a spark of hope; developing insight; activating the instinct to fight back; discovering keys to well-being; maintaining a constant equilibrium between internal and external forces; and, finally, seeing light at the end of the tunnel. Comparison of these categories led to their being consolidated into a core category in which recovery is defined as a 'process involving intrinsic, non-linear progress that is primarily generated by the role as actor that the individual adopts to rebuild his or her sense of self and to manage the imbalance between internal and external forces with the objective of charting a path through the social world and regaining a sense of well-being on all biopsychosocial levels.' Conclusion: This study of recovery from schizophrenia is conceptualised from the nursing perspective: the concept of 'Human Responses' [American Nurses Association (ANA), 1980. Nursing: A Social Policy Statement. ANA, Kansas City, MO; American Association of Neuroscience Nurses (AANN's), 2001. AANN's Neuroscience Nursing: Human Responses to Neurologic Dysfunction, second ed. W. B. Saunders Company, Philadelphia]. It was possible to go beyond a descriptive analysis and bring out the dynamics of the process through a detailed, in-depth presentation ofrecovery process. The theoretical explanation we have postulated is based on the inner resources of individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia and their potential to make a recovery.

Gantry rotation is limited to 120 degrees from vertical. X-rays of 80-100 kVp from the smaller 0.4-mm focal spot are used for imaging. Both 0.4-mm and 3.0-mm focal spots operate at 225 kVp for irradiation. Robotic translate/rotate stages are used to position the animal. Cone-beam computed tomography is achieved by rotating the horizontal animal between the stationary X-ray source and a flat-panel detector. The radiation beams range from 0.5 mm in diameter to 60 x 60 mm(2). Dosimetry is measured with radiochromic films. Monte Carlo dose calculations are used for treatment planning. The combination of gantry and robotic stage motions facilitate conformal irradiation. Results: The SARRP spans 3 ft x 4 ft x 6 ft (width x length x height). Depending on the filtration, the isocenter dose outputs at a 1-cm depth in water were 22-375 cGy/min from the smallest to the largest radiation fields. The 20-80% dose falloff spanned 0.16 mm. Cone-beam computed tomography with 0.6 x 0.6 x 0.6 mm(3) voxel resolution was acquired with a dose of <1 cGy. Treatment planning was performed at submillimeter resolution. Conclusion: The capability of the SARRP to deliver highly focal beams to multiple animal model systems provides new research opportunities that more realistically bridge laboratory research and clinical translation.

J	Hudon, C; Belleville, S; Gauthier, S				Hudon, Carol; Belleville, Sylvie; Gauthier, Serge			The association between depressive and cognitive symptoms in amnestic mild cognitive impairment	INTERNATIONAL PSYCHOGERIATRICS			English	Article						mild cognitive impairment; depressive symptoms; Alzheimer's disease; executive functions; episodic memory; neuropsychology; neuropsychiatry	LATE-LIFE DEPRESSION; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; PROSPECTIVE COHORT; CUED-RECALL; DEFICITS; SCHIZOPHRENIA; DEMENTIA; MEMORY; ENTITY; APATHY	Background: Depressive symptoms are frequently observed in older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). However, little is known regarding the cognitive characteristics of this important subgroup. Methods: We examined executive functions (controlled inhibition) and verbal episodic memory in 33 healthy older adults (control group), 18 older adults with amnestic MCI plus subclinical depressive symptoms (a-MCI/D+ group), and 26 older adults with amnestic MCI but no depressive symptoms (a-MCI group). Results: Compared to the a-MCI and control groups, patients with a-MCI/D+ showed poor controlled inhibition. Moreover, in verbal episodic memory these patients recalled fewer words than control participants on immediate free, delayed free, and delayed total (free plus cued) recall. Performance on immediate recall suggested a self-retrieval deficit, but delayed performance also revealed the existence of an encoding impairment. In the a-MCI group, participants exhibited normal performance on the executive task, but pervasive memory impairment; the memory deficit concerned free and total recall on both immediate and delayed tasks, suggesting the existence of encoding and self-retrieval disturbances. Conclusions: This study reveals differences between the pattern of cognitive impairment for a-MCI/D+ and a-MCI subgroups particularly at the level of executive capacities. In terms of memory functioning, the differences between the subgroups were more subtle; more studies are needed in order to better characterize the memory impairment of a-MCI/D+ and a-MCI patients.

Children aged 7 to 13 years with developmental language impairment or normal language (controls) under-went language, nonverbal cognitive, motor and neurological assessments, standardized assessment for subtle neurological signs, and magnetic resonance imaging. Nine children with developmental language impairment and 12 controls participated. No focal abnormalities were identified on standard neurological examination. Age and developmental language impairment were independent predictors of neurological subtle signs scores (r(2) = 0.52). Imaging abnormalities were identified in two boys with developmental language impairment and no controls (P = .17). Lesions identified were predicted neither by history nor by neurological examination. Previously unsuspected lesions were identified in almost 25% of children with developmental language impairment. Constraints regarding cooperation and sedation requirements may limit the clinical application of imaging modalities in this population.

While loss-of-function mutations in FGF receptor 1 (FGFR1) cause human GnRH deficiency, to date no specific ligand for FGFR1 has been identified in GnRH neuron ontogeny. Using a candidate gene approach, we identified 6 missense mutations in FGF8 in IHH probands with variable olfactory phenotypes. These patients exhibited varied degrees of GnRH deficiency, including the rare adult-onset form of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. Four mutations affected all 4 FGF8 splice isoforms (FGF8a, FGF8b, FGF8e, and FGF8f), while 2 mutations affected FGF8e and FGF8f isoforms only. The mutant FGF8b and FGF8f ligands exhibited decreased biological activity in vitro. Furthermore, mice homozygous for a hypomorphic Fgf8 allele lacked GnRH neurons in the hypothalamus, while heterozygous mice showed substantial decreases in the number of GnRH neurons and hypothalamic GnRH peptide concentration. In conclusion, we identified FGF8 as a gene implicated in GnRH deficiency in both humans and mice and demonstrated an exquisite sensitivity of GnRH neuron development to reductions in FGF8 signaling.

This applies also to grasshoppers. which for mate identification rely mainly on the characteristic temporal patterns of their communication signals. Usually the signals arriving at a receiver are contaminated by various kinds of noise. In addition to extrinsic noise, intrinsic noise caused by stochastic processes within the nervous system contributes to making signal recognition a difficult task. The authors asked to what degree intrinsic noise affects temporal resolution and, particularly. the discrimination of similar acoustic signals. This study aims at exploring, the neuronal basis for sexual selection, which depends on exploiting subtle differences between basically similar signals. Applying a metric. by which the similarities of spike trains can be assessed. the authors investigated how well the communication signals of different individuals of the same species could be discriminated and correctly classified based on the responses of auditory neurons. This spike train metric yields clues to the optimal temporal resolution with which spike trains should be evaluated.

Materials and Methods: This work was performed in the context of clinical trials for multiple sclerosis. Quality control (QC) procedures included were: (i) patient brain identity verification, (ii) alphanumeric parameter matching, (iii) signal-to-noise ratio estimation, (iv) gadolinium-enhancement verification, and (v) detection of ghosting due to head motion. Each QC procedure produces a quantitative measurement which is compared against an acceptance threshold that was determined based on receiver operating characteristic analysis of traditional manual and visual QC performed by trained experts. Results: The automated QC results have high sensitivity and specificity when compared with the visual QC. Conclusion: Our automated objective QC procedure can replace many manual subjective procedures to provide increased data throughput while reducing reader variability.	[Gedamu, Elias L.; Collins, D.

In this study, we explored the regulation of 5' TOP mRNAs during late-LTP (L-LTP). Synaptic plasticity was studied at Schaffer collateral - CA1 pyramidal cell synapses in rat organotypic hippocampal slices. Forskolin, an adenylate cyclase activator, induced L-LTP in organotypic slices that was mTOR-dependent. To determine if 5' TOP mRNAs are specifically up-regulated during L-LTP, we generated a 5' TOP-myr-dYFP reporter to selectively monitor 5' TOP translation. Confocal imaging experiments in cultured slices revealed an increase in somatic and dendritic fluorescence after forskolin treatment. This up-regulation was dependent on an intact TOP sequence and was mTOR, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-dependent. Our findings indicate that forskolin induces L-LTP in hippocampal neurons and up-regulates 5' TOP mRNAs translation via mTOR, suggesting that up-regulation of the translational machinery is a candidate mechanism for the stabilization of LTP.

We previously reported that a family of Kunitz domain-derived peptides called Angiopeps can be used as a drug delivery system for the brain. Here, we further characterize the transcytosis ability of these peptides using an in vitro model of the BBB and in situ brain perfusion. These peptides, and in particular Angiopep-2, exhibited higher transcytosis capacity and parenchymal accumulation than do transferrin, lactoferrin, and avidin. Angiopep-2 transport and accumulation in brain endothelial cells were unaffected by the P-glycoprotein inhibitor, cyclosporin A, indicating that this peptide is not a substrate for the efflux pump P-glycoprotein. However, competition studies show that activated alpha(2)-macroglobulin, a specific ligand for the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1 (LRP1) and Angiopep-2 can share the same receptor. In addition, LRP1 was detected in glioblastomas and brain metastases from lung and skin cancers. Fluorescent microscopy also revealed that Alexa488-Angiopep-2 co-localized with LRP1 in brain endothelial cell monolayers. Overall, these results suggest that Angiopep-2 transport across the BBB is, in part, mediated by LRP1.

Temporal processing across multiple topographic maps in the electrosensory system	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article							WEAKLY ELECTRIC FISH; LATERAL-LINE LOBE; SPIKE-FREQUENCY ADAPTATION; APTERONOTUS-LEPTORHYNCHUS; GYMNOTIFORM FISH; INFORMATION-TRANSMISSION; CORTICAL ORGANIZATION; EIGENMANNIA-VIRESCENS; POTASSIUM CHANNELS; CHIRPING BEHAVIOR	Multiple topographic representations of sensory space are common in the nervous system and presumably allow organisms to separately process particular features of incoming sensory stimuli that vary widely in their attributes. We compared the response properties of sensory neurons within three maps of the body surface that are arranged strictly in parallel to two classes of stimuli that mimic prey and conspecifics, respectively. We used information-theoretic approaches and measures of phase locking to quantify neuronal responses. Our results show that frequency tuning in one of the three maps does not depend on stimulus class. This map acts as a low-pass filter under both conditions. A previously described stimulusclass-dependent switch in frequency tuning is shown to occur in the other two maps. Only a fraction of the information encoded by all neurons could be recovered through a linear decoder. Particularly striking were low-pass neurons the information of which in the high-frequency range could not be decoded linearly. We then explored whether intrinsic cellular mechanisms could partially account for the differences in frequency tuning across maps. Injection of a Ca2+ chelator had no effect in the map with low-pass characteristics. However, injection of the same Ca2+ chelator in the other two maps switched the tuning of neurons from band-pass/high-pass to low-pass. These results show that Ca2+-dependent processes play an important part in determining the functional roles of different sensory maps and thus shed light on the evolution of this important feature of the vertebrate brain.

J	Delivet-Mongrain, H; Leblond, H; Rossignol, S				Delivet-Mongrain, Hugo; Leblond, Hugues; Rossignol, Serge			Effects of localized intraspinal injections of a noradrenergic blocker on locomotion of high decerebrate cats	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article							RAT SPINAL-CORD; II MUSCLE AFFERENTS; NEONATAL-RAT; LUMBAR SEGMENTS; NEWBORN RAT; COMMISSURAL INTERNEURONS; HINDLIMB LOCOMOTION; PATTERN GENERATION; CONTUSION INJURIES; RECEPTOR AGONISTS	Previous studies demonstrated that neuronal networks located in midlumbar segments (L3-L4) are critical for the expression of locomotion in cats following complete spinalization. In the present study the importance of several thoracolumbar segments (T8-L7) for the generation of spontaneous hindlimb locomotion in decerebrate cats was evaluated. Experiments were performed in high decerebrate cats (n = 18) walking spontaneously. Yohimbine, an alpha2-noradrenergic antagonist, was microinjected intraspinally in various thoracolumbar segments. Locomotor performance was evaluated with kinematics and electromyographic (EMG) recordings before and after each injection. When and if spontaneous locomotion (SL) was abolished, skin or perineal stimuli ( exteroceptive stimuli) were used to trigger locomotion (exteroceptive-induced locomotion [EL]). Yohimbine injections at L3 or L4 completely inhibited SL and EL. In contrast, injections at T8 did not interfere with SL or EL. Injections at T10, T11, T12, L5, L6, and L7 inhibited SL but EL could still be evoked. Injections at T13, L1, and L2 had similar effects except that the quality of locomotion evoked by exteroceptive stimulation declined. Combined injections at T13, L1, and L2 abolished SL and EL, in contrast to injections restricted to the same individual segments. Simultaneous injections at L5, L6, and L7 also abolished SL but EL could still be induced. These results suggest that noradrenergic mechanisms in L3-L4 segments are involved in the expression of locomotion in decerebrate cats, whereas antagonizing noradrenergic inputs in individual rostral or caudal segments may alter the expression and overall quality of the locomotor pattern without abolishing locomotion.

Asymmetric recovery in cerebellar-deficient mice following unilateral labyrinthectomy	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Review							HORIZONTAL VESTIBULOOCULAR REFLEX; VESTIBULAR NUCLEUS NEURONS; HIGH-ACCELERATION ROTATIONS; ALERT GUINEA-PIG; RECEPTOR DELTA-2 SUBUNIT; LONG-TERM MODIFICATIONS; C-FOS EXPRESSION; GLUTAMATE-RECEPTOR; OCULAR REFLEX; MUTANT MICE	The term "vestibular compensation" refers to the resolution of motor deficits resulting from a peripheral vestibular lesion. We investigated the role of the cerebellum in the compensation process by characterizing the vestibuloocular reflex (VOR) evoked by head rotations at frequencies and velocities similar to those in natural behaviors in wild-type (WT) versus cerebellar-deficient Lurcher (Lc/+) mice. We found that during exploratory activity, normal mice produce head rotations largely consisting of frequencies <= 4 Hz and velocities and accelerations as large as 400 degrees/s and 5,000 degrees/s(2), respectively. Accordingly, the VOR was characterized using sinusoidal rotations (0.2-4 Hz) as well as transient impulses (similar to 400 degrees/s; similar to 2,000 degrees/s(2)). Before lesions, WT and Lc/+ mice produced similar VOR responses to sinusoidal rotation. Lc/+ mice, however, had significantly reduced gains for transient stimuli. After unilateral labyrinthectomy, VOR recovery followed a similar course for WT and Lc/+ groups during the first week: gain was reduced by 80% for ipsilesionally directed head rotations on day 1 and improved for both strains to values of similar to 0.4 by day 5. Moreover, responses evoked by contralesionally directed rotations returned to prelesion in both strains within this period. However, unlike WT, which showed improving responses to ipsilesionally directed rotations, recovery plateaued after first week for Lc/+ mice. Our results show that despite nearly normal recovery in the acute phase, long-term compensation is compromised in Lc/+. We conclude that cerebellar pathways are critical for long-term restoration of VOR during head rotation toward the lesioned side, while noncerebellar pathways are sufficient to restore proper gaze stabilization during contralesionally directed movements.

On the basis of the key role of the central opioidergic system in addiction and substance abuse, we investigated the relationship between certain personality traits that are supposed to be relevant in addiction and the opioid receptor status in healthy subjects. Methods: We investigated 23 healthy male volunteers who were extensively clinically tested to exclude substance abuse. All of the subjects underwent 1 PET scan with the subtype-nonselective opioidergic radioligand F-18-fluoroethyl-diprenorphine under resting conditions without sensory or cognitive stimulation. Subsequently, the subjects were psychologically tested for the personality traits novelty seeking, harm avoidance, reward dependence, and persistence, according to Cloninger's biosocial model of personality. The binding potential (BP) as a parameter of regional cerebral opioid receptor availability was computed by means of the modified Logan plot using the occipital cortex as a reference region. Further imaging data analysis was performed using statistical parametric mapping; after stereotactic normalization, the correlations were calculated between the regional BP and the psychologic scores on a voxel-by-voxel basis. Results: The correlation analysis between personality dimensions and opioid receptor availability showed a significant (P < 0.001) positive correlation between the scores of reward dependence and the BP of the bilateral ventral striatum with nucleus accumbens (z scores, 4.52 and 4.33, respectively). The additionally performed region-of-interest-based correlation analysis yielded correlation coefficients of r = 0.84 and r = 0.81 for the left and right ventral striata, respectively. No further significant correlations were detectable between the other personality dimensions and cerebral opioid receptor binding. Conclusion: In healthy subjects, personality traits, which might be predisposing for addictive behavior, are correlated to the opioidergic neurotransmission in core structures of the human reward system.

Early-onset forms of IAD have been linked to mutations in the Tpit transcription factor gene TPIT; however, the genetic basis of juvenile- or late-onset IAD is unknown. Herein, we describe a case of a peripubertal girl with IAD and a normal TPIT gene who presented with an acute neurologic emergency, demonstrating both the variable clinical presentation of IAD and the need for continued investigation into the molecular mechanisms underlying juvenile- and late-onset IAD.

In Study 1, participants articulated 1-week intentions for physical activity and wore triaxial accelerometer over the subsequent 7 days. Among those who were motivated to increase their physical activity, those who were most and least Successful were administered an IQ test. Ill Study 2, a second sample of participants completed the same protocol and a smaller subset of matched participants attended a functional imaging (fMRI) session. In Study I. successful self-regulators (SSRs) scored significantly higher than unsuccessful self-regulators (USRs) on a test of general cognitive ability, and this difference could not he accounted for by favorability of attitudes toward physical activity or conscientiousness. In Study 2, the IQ effect was replicated, with SSRs showing a full standard deviation advantage over USRs. In the imaging protocol, USRs showed heavier recruitment of cognitive resources relative to SSRs in the anterior cingulate and orbitofrontal cortex during performance of a Stroop tasks SSRs showed heavier recruitment in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.

Recent animal work on memory reconsolidation shows that memories can be altered long after acquisition. When reactivated, memories can be modified and require a restabilization ( reconsolidation) process. We recently extended this finding to human episodic memory by showing that memory reactivation mediates the incorporation of new information into existing memory. Here we show that the spatial context plays a unique role for this type of memory updating: Being in the same spatial context during original and new learning is both necessary and sufficient for the incorporation of new information into existing episodic memories. Memories are automatically reactivated when subjects return to an original learning context, where updating by incorporating new contents can occur. However, when in a novel context, updating of existing memories does not occur, and a new episodic memory is created instead.

Segregation into functionally specialized systems and integration of information flow across systems are basic principles that are thought to shape the functional architecture of the brain. A measure called integration, originating from information theory and derived from mutual information, has been proposed to characterize the global integrative state of a network. In this paper, we show that integration can be applied in a hierarchical fashion to quantify functional interactions between compound systems, each system being composed of several regions. We apply this method to fMRI datasets from patients with low-grade glioma and show how it can efficiently extract information related to both intra- and interhemispheric reorganization induced by lesional brain plasticity.

J	Descoteaux, M; Collins, DL; Siddiqi, K				Descoteaux, Maxime; Collins, D.

Dual echo acquisitions are often performed that yield proton-density (PD) and T2-weighted images to evaluate edema near a tumor or lesion. In this paper we develop a novel geometric flow for segmenting vasculature in PD images, which can also be applied to the easier cases of MR angiography data or Gadolinium enhanced MRI. Obtaining vasculature from PD data is of clinical interest since the acquisition of such images is widespread, the scanning process is non-invasive, and the availability of vessel segmentation methods could obviate the need for an additional angiographic or contrast-based sequence during preoperative imaging. The key idea is to first apply Frangi's vesselness measure [Frangi, A., Niessen, W., Vincken, K.L., Viergever, M.A., 1998. Multiscale vessel enhancement filtering. In: International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention, vol. 1496 of Lecture Notes in Computer Science, pp. 130-137] to find putative centerlines of tubular structures along with their estimated radii. This measure is then distributed to create a vector field which allows the flux maximizing flow algorithm of Vasilevskiy and Siddiqi [Vasilevskiy, A., Siddiqi, K., 2002. Flux maximizing geometric flows. IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence 24 (12), 1565-1578] to be applied to recover vessel boundaries. We carry out a qualitative validation of the approach on PD, MR angiography and Gadolinium enhanced MRI volumes and suggest a new way to visualize the segmentations in 2D with masked projections. We validate the approach quantitatively on a single-subject data set consisting of PD, phase contrast (PC) angiography and time of flight (TOF) angiography volumes, with an expert segmented version of the TOF volume viewed as the ground truth. We then validate the approach quantitatively on 19 PD data sets from a new digital brain phantom, with semi-automatically obtained labels from the corresponding angiography volumes viewed as ground truth. A significant finding is that both for the single-subject and multi-subject studies, 90% or more of the vasculature in the ground truth segmentation is recovered from the automatic segmentation of the other volumes.

The goal of this study was to determine strain values in subjects with normal carotid arteries and the reproducibility of these measurements. Methods: Sixteen individuals without previous history of carotid atherosclerosis were recruited in four age categories [40-49], [50-59], [60-69], and [70-79] years old. The left and right common and internal carotids (LCC, LIC, RCC, and RIC, respectively) were independently scanned by two radiologists (RAD-A and RAD-B). The axial strain elastograms were computed with the Lagrangian speckle model estimator. Results: Supported by Bland-Altman analyses, strain values between LCC and RCC were found similar with a Pearson correlation coefficient (r) of 0.83 (p < 0.0001). Equivalently, a good correlation was found between RAD-A and RAD-B for common carotids with r=0.80 (p < 0.0001). Lower strain values (p < 0.001) were measured for male common carotids (1.62 +/- 0.32%) than females (2.21 +/- 0.76%). Regarding the internal carotid strain measurements, the correlation was lower between RAD-A and RAD-B with r=0.52 (p=0.01), but drastically decreased between LIC and RIC (r=0.16, nonsignificant). Male internal carotid strain estimates (p=0.03) were lower (1.48 +/- 0.44%) than in females (1.84 +/- 0.64%). Additionally, male common and internal carotid mean elastic moduli varied from 33-106 kPa, whereas it covered a range of 25-67 kPa for females. Female carotids were more elastic (44 +/- 17 kPa) than males (58 +/- 17 kPa, p < 0.001). Conclusion: Strain measurements in common carotids were found reproducible. However, less consistency was observed for the deeper internal carotids. The NIVE imaging method still remains to be validated with pathological cases, but it might provide a unique approach for stroke prevention and characterization of vascular stiffness.

Physiological role for phosphatidic acid in the translocation of the novel protein kinase C Apl II in Aplysia neurons	MOLECULAR AND CELLULAR BIOLOGY			English	Article							MAST-CELL LINE; PHOSPHOLIPASE-D; MEMBRANE-BINDING; SENSORY NEURONS; ISOFORM SPECIFICITY; CRYSTAL-STRUCTURE; PHORBOL ESTER; DOMAIN; ACTIVATION; DELTA	In Aplysia californica, the serotonin-mediated translocation of protein kinase C (PKC) Apl II to neuronal membranes is important for synaptic plasticity. The orthologue of PKC Apl II, PKC epsilon, has been reported to require phosphatidic acid (PA) in conjunction with diacylglycerol (DAG) for translocation. We find that PKC Apl II can be synergistically translocated to membranes by the combination of DAG and PA. We identify a mutation in the C1b domain (arginine 273 to histidine; PKC Apl II-R273H) that removes the effects of exogenous PA. In Aplysia neurons, the inhibition of endogenous PA production by 1-butanol inhibited the physiological translocation of PKC Apl II by serotonin in the cell body and at the synapse but not the translocation of PKC Apl II-R273H. The translocation of PKC Apl II-R273H in the absence of PA was explained by two additional effects of this mutation: (i) the mutation removed C2 domain-mediated inhibition, and (ii) the mutation decreased the concentration of DAG required for PKC Apl II translocation. We present a model in which, under physiological conditions, PA is important to activate the novel PKC Apl II both by synergizing with DAG and removing C2 domain-mediated inhibition.

Fas (CD95) is the prototypical "death receptor" of the TNFR superfamily and signals apoptosis through well established pathways. In the adult nervous system, Fas induces apoptosis in the context of neuropathology such as stroke or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. However, during nervous system development, Fas promotes neurite growth and branching. The molecular mechanisms underlying Fas-induced process formation and branching have remained unknown to date. Here, we define the molecular pathway linking Fas to process growth and branching in cell lines and in developing neurons. We describe a new cytoplasmic membrane proximal domain (MPD) that is essential for Fas-induced process growth and that is conserved in members of the TNFR superfamily. We show that the Fas MPD recruits ezrin, a molecule that links transmembrane proteins to the cytoskeleton, and activates the small GTPase Rac1. Deletion of the MPD, but not the death domain, abolished Rac1 activation and process growth. Furthermore, an ezrin-derived inhibitory peptide prevented Fas-induced neurite growth in primary neurons. Our results define a new domain, topologically and functionally distinct from the death domain, which regulates neuritogenesis via recruitment of ezrin and activation of Rac1.

Targets of Caspase-6 activity in human neurons and Alzheimer disease	MOLECULAR & CELLULAR PROTEOMICS			English	Article							DENDRITIC SPINE PROTEIN; ALPHA-INDUCED APOPTOSIS; FAS-INDUCED APOPTOSIS; BINDING-PROTEIN; INTERMEDIATE-FILAMENTS; MEDIATED CLEAVAGE; GRANZYME-B; 2-DIMENSIONAL ELECTROPHORESIS; POSTSYNAPTIC SCAFFOLDS; PROMOTES APOPTOSIS	Caspase-6 activation occurs early in Alzheimer disease and sometimes precedes the clinical manifestation of the disease in aged individuals. The active Caspase-6 is localized in neuritic plaques, in neuropil threads, and in neurofibrillary tangles containing neurons that are not morphologically apoptotic in nature. To investigate the potential consequences of the activation of Caspase-6 in neurons, we conducted a proteomics analysis of Caspase-6-mediated cleavage of human neuronal proteins. Proteins from the cytosolic and membrane subcellular compartments were treated with recombinant active Caspase-6 and compared with undigested proteins by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. LC/MS/MS analyses of the proteins that were cleaved identified 24 different potential protein substrates. Of these, 40% were cytoskeleton or cytoskeleton-associated proteins. We focused on the cytoskeleton proteins because these are critical for neuronal structure and function. Caspase-6 cleavage of alpha-Tubulin, alpha-Actinin-4, Spinophilin, and Drebrin was confirmed. At least one Caspase-6 cleavage site was identified for Drebrin, Spinophilin, and alpha-Tubulin. A neoepitope antiserum to alpha-Tubulin cleaved by Caspase-6 immunostained neurons, neurofibrillary tangles, neuropil threads, and neuritic plaques in Alzheimer disease and co-localized with active Caspase-6. These results imply that the early and neuritic activation of Caspase-6 in Alzheimer disease could disrupt the cytoskeleton network of neurons, resulting in impaired neuronal structure and function in the absence of cell death. This study provides novel insights into the pathophysiology of Alzheimer disease.

Indomethacin improves locomotor deficit and reduces brain concentrations of neuroinhibitory steroids in rats following portacaval anastomosis	NEUROGASTROENTEROLOGY AND MOTILITY			English	Article						allopregnanolone; GABAergic tone; hepatic encephalopathy; indomethacin; neurosteroids; portacaval anastomosis; tetrahydrodesoxycorticosterone	ACUTE LIVER-FAILURE; BENZODIAZEPINE RECEPTOR LIGANDS; HUMAN HEPATIC-ENCEPHALOPATHY; DIAZEPAM-BINDING INHIBITOR; NEUROACTIVE STEROIDS; IN-VIVO; INTRACRANIAL-PRESSURE; CIRRHOTIC-PATIENTS; ANIMAL-MODEL; NEUROSTEROIDS	Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a neuropsychiatric complication of both acute and chronic liver failure characterized by progressive neuronal inhibition. Some neurosteroids are potent positive allosteric modulators of the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-A receptor complex, and 'increased GABAergic tone' has been proposed to explain the neuroinhibition characteristics of HE. Brain levels of the neurosteroids pregnenolone, allopregnanolone and tetrahydrodesoxycorticosterone (THDOC) and the functional status of the GABA-A receptor complex were assessed in rats following portacaval anastomosis (PCA). Effects of indomethacin, an inhibitor of the 3 alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase enzyme involved in neurosteroid synthesis, on PCA rat locomotor activity and brain neurosteroid levels were also assessed. Significant increases of the neurosteroid pregnenolone (2.6-fold), allopregnanolone (1.7-fold) and THDOC (4.7-fold) were observed in brains of PCA rats. Brain levels of these neurosteroids were in the nanomolar range, sufficient to exert positive allosteric modulatory effects at the GABA-A receptor. Indomethacin (0.1-5 mg kg(-1)) ameliorated dose-dependently the locomotor deficit of PCA rats and concomitantly normalized brain levels of allopregnanolone and THDOC. Increased brain levels of neurosteroids with positive allosteric modulatory actions at the neuronal GABA-A receptor offer a cogent explanation for the notion of 'increased GABAergic tone' in HE. Pharmacological approaches using agents that either reduce neurosteroid synthesis or modulate the neurosteroid site on GABA-A receptor could offer new therapeutic tools for the management and treatment of HE.

Longitudinal neuroanatomical changes determined by deformation-based morphometry in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							AMYLOID PRECURSOR PROTEIN; VOXEL-BASED MORPHOMETRY; TRANSGENIC MICE; PLAQUE-FORMATION; DENTATE GYRUS; PDAPP MICE; BRAIN; MRI; EXPRESSION; PROGRESSION	Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of transgenic mice has the potential to provide valuable insight into the complex mechanisms underlying Alzheimer's disease (AD). Quantification of pathological changes is typically performed using manual segmentation methods, and requires a prior! hypotheses about anatomical structures for volumetric measurement. Alternatively, deformation-based morphometry (DBM) has been shown to be a powerful, automated technique for detecting anatomical differences between populations by examining the deformation fields used to nonlinearly warp MR images. In this multiple timepoint, in vivo study, we have applied an automated, unbiased technique for the creation of a nonlinear, population-specific reference space front which robust DBM analysis can be performed. A general, linear inixed-effects model framework was developed to follow the evolution of structural changes in mouse brain from 2.5 to 9 months of age, and to examine neuroanatomical differences between a transgenic (TG) APP/PS1 murine model of AD and wild-type (WT) littermates. Morphometric abnormalities in the TG group were localized to regions of the hippocampus, cortex, olfactory bulbs, stria terminalis, brain stem, cerebellum, and ventricles. Although volumetric reductions were detected in TG mice, no general brain atrophy was found, suggesting a developmental, rather than a degenerative, pathological process. Finally, we established a strong correlation between a DBM summary measure and manually segmented volumes for each image in the dataset. These results support the utility of DBM to Study longitudinal morphological changes in mouse models of central nervous system diseases in an automated and exploratory fashion. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Because distinct interpretations of the same repeated stimulus alternate spontaneously, this effect provides an invaluable tool to examine how speech percepts are formed in the listener's mind. In order to track the temporal dynamics of brain activity specifically linked to perceptual changes, intracerebral EEG activity was recorded from two implanted epileptic patients while performing a verbal transformation task. To this aim, they were asked to carefully listen to a speech sequence played repeatedly and to press a button whenever they perceived a change in the repeated utterance. For both patients, 300-800 ins prior to the reported perceptual transitions, high frequency activity in the gamma band range (>40 Hz) was observed within the left inferior frontal and supramarginal gyri. An additional auditory decision task was used to rule out the possibility that the increased gamma band activity was due to the patients' motor responses. These results suggest that articulatory-based representations play a key part in the endogenously driven emergence of auditory speech percepts. The findings are interpreted in relation to theories assuming a link between perception and action in the human speech processing system. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All right reserved.

The aim of the study was to further address their role in music emotion perception/recognition, and assessment by two emotional determinants, i.e., arousal (relaxing versus stimulating aspects) and valence (pleasantness degree). Epileptic patients with right or left anterior mesio-temporal resection (including the amygdala), and control subjects were presented with happy musical (chosen highly stimulating) or sad excerpts (chosen to be relaxing), that were either consonant (pleasant) or dissonant (unpleasant). The patients demonstrated an abnormal perception of dissonant music disregarding of the side of the resection; thereby confirming the role of the parahippocampal gyrus in the perception of unpleasantness. Moreover, the pleasantness of musical excerpts, in particular the happy consonant ones, was overestimated by patients with right temporal damage. In contrast, the arousal rating for happy consonant excerpts was reduced only in the group with left-resections. This modified perception of arousal might be related to the decreased ability of those patients to recognize happy and sad music. Indeed, both right and left temporal resections impaired sadness recognition, whereas happiness recognition was only reduced by the left-resections. The main result was that for the first time, the mesio-temporal structures were demonstrated to be asymmetrically involved in positive musical emotion recognition. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

In those models that do include dynamic properties, only fixed points are used to store and retrieve information, leaving many principles of nonlinear dynamic systems (NDS) aside; for instance, chaos is often perceived as a nuisance. This paper considers a nonlinear dynamic artificial neural network (NDANN) that implements NDS principles while also complying with general neuroscience constraints. After a theoretical presentation, simulation results will show that the model can exhibit multi-valued, fixed-point, region-constrained attractors and aperiodic (including chaotic) behaviors. Because the capabilities of NDANN include the modeling of spatiotemporal chaotic activities, it may be an efficient tool to help bridge the gap between biological memory neural models and behavioral memory models.

CDF Collaboration	Search for standard model Higgs boson production in association with a W boson at CDF	PHYSICAL REVIEW D			English	Article							ELECTROMAGNETIC CALORIMETER; UPGRADE; DETECTOR; TEV	We present a search for standard model Higgs boson production in association with a W boson in proton-antiproton collisions (p (p) over bar ->(WH)-H-+/-->center dot nu b (b) over bar) at a center of mass energy of 1.96 TeV. The search employs data collected with the CDF II detector which correspond to an integrated luminosity of approximately 1 fb(-1). We select events consistent with a signature of a single lepton (e(+/-)/mu(+/-)), missing transverse energy, and two jets. Jets corresponding to bottom quarks are identified with a secondary vertex tagging method and a neural network filter technique. The observed number of events and the dijet mass distributions are consistent with the standard model background expectations, and we set 95% confidence level upper limits on the production cross section times branching ratio ranging from 3.9 to 1.3 pb for Higgs boson masses from 110 to 150 GeV/c(2), respectively.

The first endocrinological marker of puberty in both boys and girls is an increased secretion of luteinizing hormone (LH). Here we investigated the phenotypic association between LH, global and focal gray and white matter in 104 healthy nine-year-old monozygotic and dizygotic twins. Votumetric MRI and voxel-based morphometry were applied to measure global gray and white matter and to estimate relative concentrations of regional cerebral. gray and white matter, respectively. A possible common genetic origin of this association (genetic correlation) was examined. Results showed that higher LH levels are associated with a larger global white matter proportion and with higher regional white matter density. Areas of increased white matter density included the cingulum, middle temporal gyrus and splenium of the corpus callosum. No association between LH and global gray matter proportion or regional gray matter density was found. Our data indicate that a common genetic factor underlies the association between LH level and regional white matter density. We suggest that the increase of white matter growth during puberty reported earlier might be directly or indirectly mediated by LH production. In addition, genes involved in LH production may be promising candidate genes in neuropsychiatric illnesses with an onset in early adolescence. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Altering the expression of RBPs has profound implications for cellular physiology, affecting RNA processes from pre-mRNA splicing to protein translation. Recent genetic and proteomic data and evidence from animal models reveal that RBPs are involved in many human diseases ranging from neurologic disorders to cancer. Here we review the emerging evidence showing the involvement of RBPs in many disease networks and conclude that defects in RNA metabolism caused by aberrations in RBPs might underlie a broader spectrum of complex human disorders.

We investigated the parallels between the nociceptive and vascular sensitivity to NE in rats with chronic post-ischemia pain (CPIP), an animal model of CRPS-I induced by hind paw ischemia-reperfusion injury. Intradermal injections of NE to the affected hind paw induced dose-dependent nociceptive behaviours in CPIP rats, but not sham animals. These behaviours were blocked by alpha(1)- and alpha(2)-adrenergic receptor antagonists, or a nitric oxide (NO) donor. Using laser Doppler flowmetry, we detected vasoconstrictor hypersensitivity in the ipsilateral CPIP hind paw, as compared to responses in sham animals or the contralateral hind paw. The vasoconstrictor hypersensitivity was also attenuated by adrenergic antagonists. Intradermal injection of [Arg(8)] vasopressin (AVP) or the endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) inhibitor, L-NIO, to the affected paw also induced nociceptive behaviours in CPIP rats, but not sham rats. These results suggest CPIP rats display abnormal nociceptive responses to adrenergic and non-adrenergic vasoconstrictive agents. Furthermore, the nociceptive responses to NE in CPIP rats are paralleled by enhanced vasoconstrictive responses to NE, and are relieved by alpha-adrenergic antagonists or a vasodilator. We conclude that persistent tissue ischemia and hypersensitivity to sympathetic vasoconstriction are important mechanisms for pain in CPIP rats, and that either reducing vasoconstriction or enhancing vasodilatation may be effective methods of relieving the pain of CRPS-I.

In the present study the effects of olfactory bulbectomy in drug-naive adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (200-240 g) on global (gCGU) and regional cerebral glucose (rCGU) utilization was evaluated. Two weeks following surgery, the autoradiographic measurement of CGU using [(14)C]-2-deoxyglucose was employed. The levels of CGU in the OBX and sham-operated rats were compared in 40 brain regions. Statistical methods indicate significantly lower levels of global (overall) CGU in the OBX group than in the sham group. Discriminant analysis was done on the z-scores to remove animal to animal variability. The following thirteen regions were identified by the stepwise discriminant analysis of the z-scores as significantly contributing to the differences between the sham and OBX: amygdala, cingulate cortex, caudate putamen at the level of globus pallidus, caudate putamen-lateral part, dorsal subiculum, dorsal thalamus, hypothalamus, median raphe, somatosensory cortex, substantia nigra, ventral hippocampus, ventral tegmental area and the ventral thalamus. The pattern of changes in the rCGU following OBX does not completely correlate with the pattern of connectivity of the olfactory bulbs, however, many regions with direct connection to the olfactory bulbs (e.g., amygdala, hypothalamus, ventral hippocampus, and ventral tegmental area) were found to be important for differentiation. No left to right asymmetries in the rCGU were found. The data suggest that there are very important regional differences in glucose utilization between the OBX and sham operated rats, which points to the need to study antidepressants in an animal model of depression rather than in normal animals.

We now report a virtual absence in apoE knock-out (KO) mice of normal nerve growth factor (NGF)-driven compensatory sprouting of undamaged cutaneous nociceptive nerves. In contrast, NGF-independent regeneration of crushed axons was unaffected. Essentially similar results came from aged wild-type mice. In apoE KO mice, the endogenous sprouting stimulus was suspect, because NGF administration induced normal sprouting; nevertheless, NGF increased normally in denervated skin, transported normally in the axons, and led to phosphorylation of trkA, erk1, and erk2. However, sprouting was restored in apoE KO mice (although not in aged mice) by fumonisin B1, an inhibitor of ceramide synthesis. A shotgun analysis revealed a wide array of changes in individual ceramide species in DRG neurons of apoE KO mice, and the changes for ceramide species OH_N15: 0 made it a candidate inhibitor of sprouting ( increased in apoE KO mice and normalized by fumonisin B1). Nevertheless, the unknown effects of individual ceramide species on sprouting, as well as the variability of their changed levels in apoE KO mice and how these were affected by fumonisin B1, support a different conclusion. We suggest that absence of apoE expression alters the balance among ceramide species to one that collectively inhibits compensatory sprouting, whereas fumonisin B1 establishes a new balance that allows sprouting. Nontoxic ceramide modulators might usefully promote sprouting and circuitry repair in neurodegenerative disorders in which ceramide species are perturbed, adding to the benefits of reducing ceramide-induced neuronal apoptosis.

The main features of TLE are: (i) epileptic foci in the limbic system; (ii) an "initial precipitating injury"; (iii) the so-called "latent period"; and (iv) the presence of hippocampal sclerosis leading to reorganization of neuronal networks. Many of these characteristics can be reproduced in rodents by systemic injection of pilocarpine; in this animal model, SE is followed by a latent period and later by the appearance of spontaneous recurrent seizures (SRSs). These processes are, however, influenced by experimental conditions such as rodent species, strain, gender, age, doses and routes of pilocarpine administration, as well as combinations with other drugs administered before and/or after SE. In the attempt to limit these sources of variability, we evaluated the methodological procedures used by several investigators in the pilocarpine model; in particular, we have focused on the behavioural, electrophysiological and histo pathological findings obtained with different protocols. We addressed the various experimental approaches published to date, by comparing mortality rates, onset of SRSs, neuronal damage, and network reorganization. Based on the evidence reviewed here, we propose that the pilocarpine model can be a valuable tool to investigate the mechanisms involved in TLE, and even more so when standardized to reduce mortality at the time of pilocarpine injection, differences in latent period duration, variability in the lesion extent, and SRS frequency.

This study aimed at comparing the beneficial effects of N-Acetyl-L-Cysteine (NAC, antioxidant) and ramipril (angiotensin-1 converting enzyme inhibitor) on tactile and cold allodynia induced by chronic glucose feeding. Impact of these treatments was also assessed on hypertension, plasma glucose and insulin concentrations, insulin resistance and kinin B, receptor expression. Male Wistar rats (50-75 g) were given 10% D-glucose in their drinking water for 11 weeks or tap water (controls). Glucose-fed rats were treated either with NAC (1 g/kg/day, gavage), ramipril (1 mg/kg/day in drinking water) or no drug during the last 5 weeks. Glucose feeding for 6 weeks induced a significant increase in systolic blood pressure and hyperglycaemia which was accompanied by tactile and cold allodynia. At 11 weeks, plasma insulin, insulin resistance (HOMA index), kinin B, receptor mRNA in spinal cord and renal cortex and B, receptor binding sites in spinal cord were enhanced in glucose-fed rats. NAC and ramipril caused a progressive to complete inhibition of tactile and cold allodynia from 6 to 11 weeks. High systolic blood pressure, hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance and kinin B, receptor expression were also normalized or attenuated in glucose-fed rats by either treatment. Results suggest that chronic treatment with an antioxidant or an ACE inhibitor provides similar beneficial effects on sensory polyneuropathy, hypertension and insulin resistance in glucose-fed rats. Both therapies were associated with a reduction of the expression of the pro-nociceptive kinin B, receptor. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Global DNA methylation is believed to be stable postnatally and to be similar across tissues in the adult mammal. It has also been a long held belief that DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) play a very limited role in postmitotic tissues. Recent data suggests a more dynamic role for DNA methylation in the brain postnatally, therefore we examined the global state of methylation and the expression of the known DNMTs in the different regions of the hippocampus. We observed strikingly different levels of global methylation in the adult rat dentarte gyrus (DG) and CA1 region in comparison with the CA2 and CA3 regions. mRNA levels of DNA methyltransferases exhibited similar regional specificity and were correlated with global DNA methylation levels. These regional differences in global methylation and expression of the DNA methylation machinery in the adult brain are consistent with the emerging hypothesis that DNA methylation may play a dynamic physiological role in the adult brain.

However, little is known about the effects of nighttime restricted feeding. Previously, we showed that daytime restricted access to a highly palatable complete meal replacement, Ensure Plus (Ensure), shifts the rhythm of expression of the clock protein PER2 in limbic forebrain areas including the oval nucleus of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNSTov), central nucleus of the amygdala (CEA), basolateral amygdala (BLA) and dentate gyrus (DG), and induces a rhythm in the dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus (DMH) in food deprived (restricted feeding), but not free-fed rats (restricted treat). In the present study we investigated the effects of nighttime restricted feeding (Ensure only, 2h/night) and nighttime restricted treats (Ensure 2h/night + free access to chow) in order to determine whether these effects were dependent on the time of day the meal was provided. We found that nighttime restricted feeding, like daytime restricted feeding, shifted the rhythm of PER2 expression in the BNSTov and CEA and peak expression was observed similar to 12h after the mealtime. Also consistent with previous work, nighttime restricted feeding induced a rhythm of PER2 expression in the DMH and these effects occurred without: affecting the rhythm in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). In contrast to previous work with daytime restricted feeding, nighttime restricted feeding had no effect on PER2 rhythms in the BLA and DG. Finally, nighttime restricted treats, as was the case for daytime restricted treats, had no effect on PER2 expression in any of the brain areas studied. The present results together with our previous findings show that the effect of restricted feeding on PER2 rhythms in the limbic forebrain and hypothalamus depend on a negative energy balance and vary as a function of time of day in a brain region-specific manner.

To induce perceptual rivalry in the tactile domain, we developed a new tactile illusion, based on the visual apparent-motion quartet [2]. Pairs of 200 ms vibrotactile stimuli were applied to the finger pad at intervals separated by 300 ms. The location of each successive stimulus pair alternated between the opposing diagonal corners of the similar to 1 cm(2) stimulation array. This stimulation sequence led all participants to report switches between the perception of motion traveling either up and down or left and right across their fingertip. Adaptation to tactile stimulation biased toward one direction caused subsequent ambiguous stimulation to be experienced in the opposing direction. In contrast, when consecutive trials of ambiguous stimulation were presented, motion was generally perceived in the direction consistent with the motion reported in the previous trial. Voluntary eye movements induced shifts in the tactile perception toward a motion axis aligned along a world-centered coordinate frame. Because the tactile quartet results in switching perceptual states despite unvaried sensory input, it is ideally suited to future studies of the neural processes associated with conscious tactile perception.

It is often thought to be a largely intractable problem in adult patients because of a lack of neuronal plasticity after this critical period [1]; however, recent advances have suggested that plasticity is still present in the adult amblyopic visual cortex [2-6]. Here, we present data showing that repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) of the visual cortex can temporarily improve contrast sensitivity in the amblyopic visual cortex. The results indicate continued plasticity of the amblyopic visual system in adulthood and open the way for a potential new therapeutic approach to the treatment of amblyopia.

Compared to the study of visual expertise, the field of expertise in sound source recognition has been neglected. Different types of visual experts have been studied extensively both in behavioral and neuroimaging studies, leading to a vigorous debate about the domain specificity of face perception. In the present paper, we briefly review what is known about visual expertise and propose that the same framework can be used in the auditory domain to ask the question of domain specificity for the processing and neural correlates of the human voice. We suggest that questions like "are voices special ?" can be partially answered with neuroimaging studies of "auditory experts", such as musicians and bird experts, who rely on subtle acoustical parameters to identify auditory exemplars at a subordinate level.

Topographical Fos induction within the ventral midbrain and projection sites following self-stimulation of time posterior mesencephalon	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						reward; ventral tegmental area; prefrontal cortex; ventral striatum; bed nucleus of the stria terminalis; immediate-early gene	MEDIAL FOREBRAIN-BUNDLE; ALCOHOL-PREFERRING RATS; TEGMENTAL AREA; BRAIN-STIMULATION; DOPAMINE NEURONS; C-FOS; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; NUCLEUS-ACCUMBENS; WISTAR RATS; ELECTRICAL-STIMULATION	Rats will readily perform an operant response to self-administer electrical stimulation to the posterior mesencephalon (PM). Previous results show that axons that support self-stimulation travel between the PM and the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and that their activation increases firing of VTA neurons. The present work sought to extend these findings by describing the distribution of ventral midbrain neurons affected by PM self-stimulation. In Experiment 1, ventral midbrain Fos-immunoreactivity (IR) was assessed in three groups of rats implanted with a monopolar electrode; two groups were trained to self-administer stimulation, but only one was allowed to self-stimulate on the test day, whereas the third was never trained or tested. Self-stimulation induced prominent Fos-IR that was differentially distributed within the VTA and substantia nigra (SN). Control rats showed only sparse labeling. In Experiment 2, ventral midbrain Fos-IR was assessed with three additional groups trained to self-administer PM stimulation and tested as follows: Group-1 was allowed to self-stimulate, Group-2 received stimulation at parameters that failed to support self-stimulation (deemed non-rewarding) "yoked" to the rate of responding of Group-1, and Group-3 received no stimulation. PM self-stimulation induced Fos-IR throughout the rostral-caudal VTA and within the SN reticulata. Non-rewarding stimulation induced sparse Fos-IR, comparable to no stimulation. Fos-IR specific to PM self-stimulation was also observed within the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) and nucleus accumbens (NAS)-shell, but not within NAS-core, caudate putamen, medial prefrontal or orbital cortices. These findings are consistent with evidence that reward or positive reinforcement can be triggered by chemical and electrical stimulation over a large rostral-caudal extent of the VTA. They suggest that among ventral midbrain projection sites, the BNST and NAS-shell constitute important components of the circuitry implicated in reward. They provide additional support for the functional link between neurons that support PM and VTA self-stimulation, and offer topographical guidance to future attempts at their identification.

An EPSC sensitive to glutamatergic antagonists was found in all neurons. In the majority of cases (189/243), the EPSC had two distinct components: an early one sensitive to 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX) and a late one that was sensitive to D-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (APV) showing that early and late components of the EPSC were mediated by AMPA/kainate (KA) and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors respectively. During the first four postnatal days, the amplitudes of both the AMPA/KA and NMDA components of the EPSC were relatively small and then began to increase until the end of the second postnatal week. Whereas the amplitude of the early component appeared to stabilize from that point on, the late component began to decrease and became virtually undetectable in preparations from animals older than 3 weeks unless the AMPA/KA response was blocked with CNQX. In addition, the ratio between the amplitude of the NMDA and AMPA/KA receptor-mediated components of the EPSC followed a developmental pattern parallel to that of the NMDA receptor component showing an increase during the first two postnatal weeks followed by a decrease. Together, these results show that, during postnatal development, there is a period when NMDA receptor-mediated EPSC are preeminent and that time frame might represent a period during which the development of the nAcb might be sensitive to environmental manipulation.

Neuromodulatory role of acetylcholine in visually-induced cortical activation: Behavioral and neuroanatomical correlates	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						c-Fos immunoreactivity; cholinergic system; muscarinic receptor; use-dependent activity; visual discrimination; visual acuity	LONG-TERM POTENTIATION; RAT CEREBRAL-CORTEX; LATERAL GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; BARREL-RELATED COLUMNS; EARLY GENE-EXPRESSION; C-FOS EXPRESSION; MUSCARINIC RECEPTORS; BASAL FOREBRAIN; CHOLINERGIC INNERVATION; ATTENTIONAL FUNCTIONS	Acetylcholine is released in the primary visual cortex during visual stimulation and may have a neuromodulatory role in visual processing. The present study uses both behavioral and functional neuroanatomy investigations to examine this role in the rat. In the first set of experiments the cholinergic system was lesioned with 192 immunoglobulin G (IgG) saporin and the visual acuity and performance in a visual water maze task were assessed. The cholinergic lesion did not affect the visual acuity measured pre- and post-lesion but it did reduce the efficiency to learn a novel orientation discrimination task measured post-lesion. In order to better understand the involvement of the cholinergic system in the neuronal activity in the visual cortex c-Fos expression induced by patterned visual stimulation was further investigated. Results obtained following lesion of the cholinergic fibers (192 IgG-saporin or quisqualic acid), muscarinic inhibition (scopolamine), or NMDA receptor inhibition (CPP) were compared with control conditions. Double and triple immunolabeling was used in order to determine the neurochemical nature of the activated cortical cells. The results demonstrated that patterned stimulation elicited a significant increase in c-Fos immunolabeled neurons in layer IV of the contralateral primary visual cortex to the stimulated eye which was completely abolished by cholinergic fibers lesion as well as scopolamine administration. This effect was independent of NMDA receptor transmission. The c-Fos activation was predominantly observed in the glutamatergic spiny stellate cells and less frequently in GABAergic interneurons. Altogether, these results demonstrate a strong involvement of the basal forebrain cholinergic system in the modulation of post-synaptic visual processing, which could be related to cognitive enhancement or attention during visual learning.

Comparison of nomograms with other methods for predicting outcomes in prostate cancer: A critical analysis of the literature	CLINICAL CANCER RESEARCH			English	Review							ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; BEAM RADIATION-THERAPY; SEMINAL-VESICLE INVASION; SARCOMA-SPECIFIC DEATH; BIOPSY GLEASON SCORE; LYMPH-NODE INVASION; RADICAL PROSTATECTOMY; LOGISTIC-REGRESSION; POSTOPERATIVE NOMOGRAM; PREOPERATIVE NOMOGRAM	Purpose: Accurate estimates of risk are essential for physicians if they are to recommend a specific management to patients with prostate cancer, Accurate risk estimates are also required for clinical trial design, to ensure homogeneous patient groups. Because there is more than one model available for prediction of most outcomes, model comparisons are necessary for selection of the best model. We describe the criteria based on which to judge predictive tools, describe the limitations of current predictive tools, and compare the different predictive methodologies that have been used in the prostate cancer literature. Experimental Design: Using MEDLINE, a literature search was done on prostate cancer decision aids from January 1966 to July 2007. Results: The decision aids consist of nomograms, risk groupings, artificial neural networks, probability tables, and classification and regression tree analyses. The following considerations need to be applied when the qualities of predictive models are assessed: predictive accuracy (internal or ideally external validation), calibration (i.e., performance according to risk level or in specific patient subgroups), generalizability (reproducibility and transportability), and level of complexity relative to established models, to assess whether the new model offers advantages relative to available alternatives. Studies comparing decision aids have shown that nomograms outperform the other methodologies. Conclusions: Nomograms provide superior individualized disease-related risk estimations that facilitate management-related decisions. Of currently available prediction tools, the nomograms have the highest accuracy and the best discriminating characteristics for predicting outcomes in prostate cancer patients.

Our aim was to investigate whether magnetic resonance techniques such as diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and magnetization transfer imaging (MTI) of the brain could be used to differentiate dyskinetic patients from control subjects. Eight drug-treated patients with TD, 12 EOD patients, 8 drug-treated patients without TD, and 10 control subjects were recruited and examined by DWI and MTI. Measurements in the caudate nucleus, putamen, and globus pallidus yielded globally different apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values between drug treated patients with TD and control subjects but the magnetization transfer ratios showed no significant variations. The discrimination between dyskinetic patients and control subjects offered by ADC values was however slightly poorer than the discrimination offered by the previously published choline/creatine ratios measured by MR spectroscopy in the basal ganglia. The results are consistent with the pathophysiological hypothesis of damage to cholinergic interneurons. (C) 2008 Movement Disorder Society.

For the first time, we thus compared, through functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), the pattern of cerebral activations in 13 skilled and 15 unskilled imagers during both physical execution and MI of a sequence of finger movements. Differences in MI abilities were assessed using well-established questionnaire and chronometric measures, as well as a new index based upon the subject's peripheral responses from the autonomic nervous system. As expected, both good and poor imagers activated the inferior and superior parietal lobules, as well as motor-related regions including the lateral and medial premotor cortex, the cerebellum and putamen. Inter-group comparisons revealed that good imagers activated more the parietal and ventrolateral premotor regions, which are known to play a critical role in the generation of mental images. By contrast, poor imagers recruited the cerebellum, orbito-frontal and posterior cingulate cortices. Consistent with findings from the motor sequence learning literature and Doyon and Ungerleider's model of motor learning [Doyon, J., Ungerleider, L. G., 2002. Functional anatomy of motor skill learning. In: Squire, L. R., Schacter, D. L. (Eds.), Neuropsychology of memory, Guilford Press, pp. 225-238], our results demonstrate that compared to skilled imagers, poor imagers not only need to recruit the cortico-striatal system, but to compensate with the cortico-cerebellar system during MI of sequential movements.

Identification of genes influencing dendrite morphogenesis in developing peripheral sensory and central motor neurons	NEURAL DEVELOPMENT			English	Article							ZINC-FINGER PROTEIN; ECDYSONE RECEPTOR ISOFORMS; CONFOCAL IMAGE STACKS; VIVO TIME-LAPSE; AXON GUIDANCE; DROSOPHILA-MELANOGASTER; CELLULAR MECHANISMS; SIGNALING PATHWAY; NUCLEAR RECEPTORS; LATERAL POSITION	Background: Developing neurons form dendritic trees with cell type-specific patterns of growth, branching and targeting. Dendrites of Drosophila peripheral sensory neurons have emerged as a premier genetic model, though the molecular mechanisms that underlie and regulate their morphogenesis remain incompletely understood. Still less is known about this process in central neurons and the extent to which central and peripheral dendrites share common organisational principles and molecular features. To address these issues, we have carried out two comparable gain-of-function screens for genes that influence dendrite morphologies in peripheral dendritic arborisation (da) neurons and central RP2 motor neurons. Results: We found 35 unique loci that influenced da neuron dendrites, including five previously shown as required for da dendrite patterning. Several phenotypes were class-specific and many resembled those of known mutants, suggesting that genes identified in this study may converge with and extend known molecular pathways for dendrite development in da neurons. The second screen used a novel technique for cell-autonomous gene misexpression in RP2 motor neurons. We found 51 unique loci affecting RP2 dendrite morphology, 84% expressed in the central nervous system. The phenotypic classes from both screens demonstrate that gene misexpression can affect specific aspects of dendritic development, such as growth, branching and targeting. We demonstrate that these processes are genetically separable. Targeting phenotypes were specific to the RP2 screen, and we propose that dendrites in the central nervous system are targeted to territories defined by Cartesian co-ordinates along the antero-posterior and the medio-lateral axes of the central neuropile. Comparisons between the screens suggest that the dendrites of peripheral da and central RP2 neurons are shaped by regulatory programs that only partially overlap. We focused on one common candidate pathway controlled by the ecdysone receptor, and found that it promotes branching and growth of developing da neuron dendrites, but a role in RP2 dendrite development during embryonic and early larval stages was not apparent. Conclusion: We identified commonalities (for example, growth and branching) and distinctions (for example, targeting and ecdysone response) in the molecular and organizational framework that underlies dendrite development of peripheral and central neurons.

In primary visual cortex, each neuron is a filter for stimulus features such as orientation, motion direction and velocity, with the appropriate combination of features eliciting maximal firing rate. Temporal correlation of spike trains was proposed as a potential code for linking the neuronal responses evoked by various features of a same object. In the present study, synchrony strength was measured between cells following an adaptation protocol (prolonged exposure to a non-preferred stimulus) which induce plasticity of neurons' orientation preference. Results: Multi-unit activity from area 17 of anesthetized adult cats was recorded. Single cells were sorted out and (1) orientation tuning curves were measured before and following 12 min adaptation and 60 min after adaptation (2) pairwise synchrony was measured by an index that was normalized in relation to the cells' firing rate. We first observed that the prolonged presentation of a non-preferred stimulus produces attractive (58%) and repulsive (42%) shifts of cell's tuning curves. It follows that the adaptation-induced plasticity leads to changes in preferred orientation difference, i.e. increase or decrease in tuning properties between neurons. We report here that, after adaptation, the neuron pairs that shared closer tuning properties display a significant increase of synchronization. Recovery from adaptation was accompanied by a return to the initial synchrony level. Conclusion: We conclude that synchrony reflects the similarity in neurons' response properties, and varies accordingly when these properties change.

Its proteolipid protein (PLP) isoform appeared in amphibians, contains an additional 35 amino acids, and, in the mammalian CNS, is the dominant myelin protein in which it confers an essential neuroprotective function. During development, the DM20 isoform is prominent in a number of tissues, and plp/DM20 transcripts are detected in multiple progenitor populations, including those that continue to express plp/DM20 as they differentiate into myelinating oligodendrocytes. The locus also encodes isoforms with extended leader sequences that accumulate in the cell bodies of several types of neurons. Here, to locate and characterize regulatory sequences controlling the complex plp/DM20 transcription program, putative regulatory sequences, suggested by interspecies conservation, were ligated individually to a minimally promoted eGFPlacZ reporter gene. These constructs were inserted in single copy at a common site adjacent to the hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase locus in embryonic stem cells and their in vivo expression programs were compared in transgenic mice. Most expressed developmental and cell-specific subprograms accommodated within the known expression phenotype of the endogenous plp/DM20 locus, thus defining multiple components of the combinatorial mechanism controlling its normal temporal and cell-specific program. Along with previously characterized nervous system enhancers, those described here should help expose the content and configuration of elements that are operational in multiple glial and neuronal lineages. The transgenic lines derived here also provide effective markers for multiple stages of glial and neuronal lineage progression.

Ossification patterns of these embryos suggest that they died during the final third of their development. The therizinosauroid identity of the embryos follows from: (1) an edentulous premaxilla with a sharp downturned edge; (2) dentary with a lateral shelf; (3) teeth with fan-shaped crowns, with a few marginal cusps; (4) humerus with a massive deltopectoral crest extending proximally, with a pointed proximomedial tuberosity; (5) ilium with an expanded and hooked preacetabular process; (6) strongly curved hypertrophied manual unguals tapering to sharp points. These embryos are closest to two Chinese therizinosauroids, Neimongosaurus yangi Zhang et al. 2001 and Erliansaurus bellamanus Xu et al. 2002. An elongated narial opening, reduced basipterygoid process, low cervical neural spines, a transversely narrow pubic apron, and a pubic foot expanded anteriorly are found in these embryos and are synapomorphies uniting the Therizinosauroidea and the Oviraptorosauria. Fusion of cervical and caudal neural arches and centra, complete ossification of thoracic ribs and ilium, possible co-ossification of tibia and fibula, fused pubes, complete meta-and acropodial elements, together with small portions of unossified epiphyses of long bones suggest an advanced precociality of these embryos.

Immune-to-brain signaling and central prostaglandin E-2 synthesis in fasted rats with altered lipopolysaccharide-induced fever	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY-REGULATORY INTEGRATIVE AND COMPARATIVE PHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						thermoregulation; acute starvation; cyclooxygenase; hypothermia	TUMOR-NECROSIS-FACTOR; BODY-TEMPERATURE; FEBRILE RESPONSE; ACUTE STARVATION; ENDOTOXIN FEVER; BEHAVIORAL THERMOREGULATION; LOCALIZED INFLAMMATION; SICKNESS BEHAVIOR; NEWBORN RABBITS; UP-REGULATION	Acute starvation attenuates the fever response to pathogens in several mammalian species. The underlying mechanisms responsible for this effect are not fully understood but may involve a compromised immune and/or thermoregulatory function, both of which are prerequisites for fever generation. In the present study, we addressed whether the impaired innate immune response contributes to the reported attenuation of the fever response in fasted rats during LPS-induced inflammation. Animals fasted for 48 h exhibited a significant and progressive hypothermia prior to drug treatment. An intraperitoneal injection of LPS (100 mu g/kg) resulted in a significantly attenuated fever in the fasted animals compared with the fed counterparts. This attenuation was accompanied by the diminution in the concentration of some [TNF and IL-1 receptor antagonist (RA)] but not all (IL-1 beta and IL-6) of the plasma cytokines normally elevated in association with the fever response. Nevertheless, fasting had no effect on the LPS-induced inflammatory responses at the level of the brain, as assessed by mRNA expressions of inhibitory factor(I)-kappa B, suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS3), IL-1 beta, cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, and microsomal PGE synthase (mPGES)-1 in the hypothalamus, as well as by PGE(2) elevations in the cerebrospinal fluid. In contrast, fasting significantly attenuated the fever response to central PGE(2) injection. These results show that fasting does not alter the febrigenic signaling from the periphery to the brain important for central PGE(2) synthesis but does affect thermoregulatory mechanisms downstream of and/or independent of central PGE(2) action.

Such enhanced behavioral flexibility is predicted to carry fitness benefits to individuals facing novel or altered environmental conditions, a theory known as the brain size-environmental change hypothesis. Here, we provide the first empirical link between brain size and survival in novel environments in mammals, the largest-brained animals on Earth. Using a global database documenting the outcome of more than 400 introduction events, we show that mammal species with larger brains, relative to their body mass, tend to be more successful than species with smaller brains at establishing themselves when introduced to novel environments, when both taxonomic and regional autocorrelations are accounted for. This finding is robust to the effect of other factors known to influence establishment success, including introduction effort and habitat generalism. Our results replicate similar findings in birds, increasing the generality of evidence for the idea that enlarged brains can provide a survival advantage in novel environments.

It is currently impossible to determine which patient will benefit from the addition of an ARB. OBJECTIVE: To explore the impact,of selected candidate genes on the hemo-dynamic, neurohormonal, and antiinflammatory effects of candesartan in patients with heart failure who are already being, treated with an ACE inhibitor. METHODS: We investigated the impact of 10 candidate genetic polymorphisms on the effects of candesartan in patients with heart failure who are treated with an ACE inhibitor. We evaluated their impact on acute (2 wk) and long-term (24 wk) changes in blood pressure and N-terminal proB-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) during treatment with candesartan. RESULTS: Thirty-one patients were included. Homozygotes of the AGTR1 A1166 allele (n = 13) had a greater decrease in systolic (-9.1 +/- 4.7 vs 1.1 +/- 3.3 mmHg; p = 0.04 by analysis of variance [ANOVA], adjusting for dose) and diastolic blood pressure (-5.1 +/- 1.5 vs 1.9 +/- 1.9,mm Hg; p = 0.005 by ANOVA, adjusting for dose) compared with C1166 allele carriers (n = 18) following 2 weeks of treatment. After 6 months of treatment, Cl 166 carriers experienced a greater decrease in NT-proBNP (-151.4 [-207; -19.8] ng/L vs 147.3 [-61.3; 882.9] ng/L; p = 0.03) and hsCRP (-0.8 [-2.2; -0.03] mg/L) vs 0.2 [-1.8; 5.3] mg/L; p = 0.09) compared with patients carrying the AA1166 genotype. No other significant association was found. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this proof-of concept study provide the first evidence that the AGTR1 A1166C polymorphism could influence the response to candesartan in patients with heart failure who are receiving ACE inhibitors. Validation of these exploratory findings in larger populations is required before use of the AGTR1 A1166C genotype can be incorporated into clinical practice.

The cleavage site of the HA protein was modified to necessitate trypsin-dependent maturation of the glycoprotein. HA, NA and M2 were efficiently incorporated in HIV vector particles which could transduce different cell lines in a trypsin-dependent manner. Results also showed that the presence of avian influenza M2 and NA proteins maximized both vector production and transduction and that transduction was highly sensitive to the specific NA inhibitor oseltamivir (Tamiflu). H5N1 HaNaM-pseudotyped HIV vector system was also adapted for cell-based high throughput screening of drug candidates against influenza virus infection, and its high sensitivity to the specific oseltamivir validates its potential utility in the identification of new influenza inhibitors. Overall, the trypsin-dependent H5N1-pseudotyped HIV vector can mimic avian influenza virus infection Processes with sufficient precision to allow for the identification of new antivirals and to study avian influenza virus biology in a lower biosafety level laboratory environment.

This relapse may occur after an apparent remission period that can range from years to several decades. Clinical observations suggest that breast-derived malignant cells have the ability to survive subclinically for a very long period of time before eventually resuming proliferation and forming detectable lesions. While the precise molecular events that correspond to this dormant phenotype remain poorly understood, data published during the last 10 years have underlined an important role of integrin proteins in the regulation of this phenomenon.

While most patients who undergo this procedure do not appear to suffer behavioral side effects, a minority experience cognitive or emotional deficits, and longitudinal studies have reported declines; however, the measures of cognitive function used have been limited. One explanation for the possible disturbance of cognitive functions is that electrical stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus disrupts the normal flow of information within cortico-striatal loops involving prefrontal, associative, or limbic cortex. We wished to assess the effect of high frequency electrical stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus in Parkinson's disease patients while they performed a comprehensive neuropsychological test battery. We selected cognitive tasks known to test the function of different cortical areas, including tests of executive function, cognitive flexibility, attention, memory, language and visual perception. Patients were tested on two separate days, with the stimulators turned on or off. Test scores were also compared to preoperative performance. In our sample of 15 patients without dementia or major depression there was no deterioration on any cognitive test as a result of stimulation. We conclude that electrical stimulation of the motor subthalamic nucleus does not cause appreciable declines in cognitive function in well-selected patients.

Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: Outpatient neuromuscular clinic. Participants: Adults (n=200; 121 women), age 18 years or older (mean age, 47y), with a confirmed diagnosis of DM1 were selected from the registry of a neuromuscular clinic (N=416). Fifty-two participants had the mild phenotype and t48 the adult phenotype. Interventions: Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures: Social participation in mobility, housing, employment, and recreation was assessed with the Life Habits Measure. Disrupted participation was based on whether help was needed in performing most life habits because of incapacities or environmental barriers. Environmental factors were assessed by using the Measure of the Quality of the Environment. Personal factors were assessed with standardized instruments including the Berg Balance Scale, the Krupp Fatigue Severity Scale, and manual muscle testing. Results: A large proportion of participants (45%-61%) reported disrupted participation in all 4 domains. Lower-extremity strength (odd ratios [OR], 15.0-5.5; P <.050) and higher fatigue (OR, 6.0-2.6; P <.05) were present in participants with disrupted participation. With regard to environmental factors, family support (OR, 3.6-2.5; P <.05) and public services (OR, 2.8-2.2; P <.05) were perceived as barriers for participants with disrupted participation in most domains. Conclusions: This study identified personal and environmental factors that may influence the trajectory toward disrupted participation in individuals with DM1. Fatigue, strength, family support, and public services were found to be independent predictors of disrupted participation.

J	Overington, SE; Dubois, F; Lefebvre, L				Overington, Sarah E.; Dubois, Frederique; Lefebvre, Louis			Food unpredictability drives both generalism and social foraging: a game theoretical model	BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY			English	Article						ecological intelligence; game theory; generalism; hawk-dove; resource predictability; social brain hypothesis; social foraging	BRAIN SIZE; NEOCORTEX SIZE; BIG BRAINS; SPECIALIZATION; EVOLUTION; BIRDS; INTELLIGENCE; AGGRESSION; PRIMATES; PREDICTABILITY	Resource predictability can influence foraging behavior in many ways. Depending on the predictability of food sources, animals may specialize on a few food types or generalize on many; they may aggressively defend feeding territories or nonaggressively share food with others. However, food defense and diet breadth have generally been studied separately. In this paper, we propose that variation in resource predictability could drive both of them together. We construct a game theoretic model to test whether situations in which resources are unpredictable might favor both generalism (the ability to use multiple food types) and nonaggressive social foraging. Our model predicts that the proportion of social generalists is highest when resources are unpredictable, whereas a predictable resource distribution favors territorial specialists. We discuss our result within the context of animal cognition research, where diet breadth and social foraging are associated with the 2 dominant views of the evolution of cognition: the "ecological" and the "social brain" hypotheses. Our results suggest that social and dietary demands on cognition might be less independent than is often assumed.

TSPO (translocator protein), previously known as PBR (peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor), is a ubiquitous 18 kDa transmembrane protein that participates in diverse cell functions. High-affinity TSPO ligands are best known for their ability to stimulate cholesterol transport in organs synthesizing steroids and bile salts, although they modulate other physiological functions, including cell proliferation, apoptosis and calcium-dependent transepithelial ion secretion. In present study, we investigated the localization and function of TSPO in salivary glands. Results. Immunohistochemical analysis of TSPO in rat salivary glands revealed that TSPO and its endogenous ligand, DBI (diazepam-binding inhibitor), were present in duct and mucous acinar cells. TSPO was localized to the mitochondria of these cells, whereas DBI was cytosolic. As expected, mitochondrial membrane preparations, which were enriched in TSPO, exhibited a high affinity for the TSPO drug ligand, H-3-labelled PK 11195, as shown by B-max and K-d values of 10.0 +/- 0.5 pmol/mg and 4.0 +/- 1.0 nM respectively. Intravenous perfusion of PK 11195 increased the salivary flow rate that was induced by muscarinic and alpha-adrenergic agonists, whereas it had no effect when administered alone. Addition of PK 11195 also increased the K+, Na+, Cl- and protein content of saliva, indicating that this ligand modulated secretion by acini and duct cells. Conclusions. High-affinity ligand binding to mitochondrial TSPO modulates neurotransmitter-induced salivary secretion by duct and mucous acinar cells of rat submandibular glands.

Differentiation block of oligodendroglial progenitor cells as a cause for remyelination failure in chronic multiple sclerosis	BRAIN			English	Article						oligodendroglial progenitors; multiple sclerosis; Olig2; Nkx2.2	CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; ADULT SPINAL-CORD; DEMYELINATED LESIONS; TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR; PRECURSOR CELLS; CNS; PROLIFERATION; MYELINATION; SURVIVAL; EXPRESSION	Impaired function/differentiation of progenitor cells might provide an explanation for the limited remyelination observed in the majority of chronic multiple sclerosis lesions. Here, we establish that in the normal adult human CNS, the transcription factors Nkx2.2 and Olig2 are strongly expressed in progenitor cells while mature oligodendrocytes are characterized by low levels of Olig2 or Nkx2.2. In vitro studies confirmed the expression of Olig2 in oligodendroglial progenitor cells and mature oligodendrocytes while astrocytes, microglial cells and neurons were negative for Olig2. In early multiple sclerosis lesions, we found Olig2-positive progenitor cells throughout all lesion stages and in periplaque white matter (PPWM). The number of progenitors in PPWM was significantly increased compared with the white matter from controls. In chronic multiple sclerosis lesions progenitor cells were still present, however, in significantly lower numbers than in early multiple sclerosis lesions. A subpopulation of progenitor cells in early multiple sclerosis lesions and PPWM but not in control cases co-expressed NogoA, a marker of mature oligodendrocytes. The co-expression of these two markers suggested that these cells were maturing oligodendrocytes recently recruited from the progenitor pool. In contrast, in chronic multiple sclerosis lesions maturing progenitors were only rarely present. In summary, we provide evidence that a differentiation block of oligodendroglial progenitors is a major determinant of remyelination failure in chronic multiple sclerosis lesions.

Many mechanistic details are still lacking, but greater knowledge of overlapping mechanisms and disease comorbidities has highlighted key areas for intervention. These include peripheral and central hyperexcitability. Among the molecular drivers are ion channels (Nav1.7, Nav1.8, Nav1.3, Cav2.2, and alpha2-delta subunits) whose expression is changed during neuropathic pain and their block shows therapeutic utility. Block of a number of ligand-gated channels [transient receptor potential (TRP)V1, TRPM8, and neuronal nicotinic receptors (NNRs)], important in neural sensitization, may also prove beneficial. Other approaches, such as the modulation of peripheral excitability via CB1 receptors, reduction of spinal excitability through block of glutamate receptors (metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 and alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-proprionate), block of activated spinal neuroglial (CCR2 and P2X7), or increasing spinal inhibition by enhancing monoaminergic activity, all offer exciting opportunities currently being validated in the clinic. Finally of note is the emergence of biological approaches, for example, antibodies, siRNA, gene therapy, offering powerful therapeutic additions with which to redress the neurological disease imbalances causing neuropathic pain.

We examined whether 1-year administration of a cocoa polyphenolic extract (Acticoa powder), orally delivered at the dose of 24 mg/kg per d between 15 and 27 months of age, affects the onset of age-related cognitive deficits, urinary free dopamine levels and lifespan in old Wistar-Unilever rats. Acticoa powder improved cognitive performances in light extinction and water maze paradigms, increased lifespan and preserved high urinary free dopamine levels. These results suggest that Acticoa powder may be beneficial in retarding age-related brain impairments, including cognitive deficits in normal ageing and perhaps neurodegenerative diseases. Further studies are required to elucidate the mechanisms of cocoa polyphenols in neuro-protection and to explore their effects in man.

We used MRI to follow the consequences of non-immunological mast cell activation induced by compound 48/80 in the rat lungs in vivo. Experimental approach: Male naive rats were scanned by MRI prior to and at several time points following intratracheal administration of the mast cell secretagogue, compound 48/80. The effects of a range of drugs on the response induced by compound 48/80 were studied. Key results: Strong fluid signals were detected by MRI in the lungs at 24 h after compound 48/80, correlating with increased protein concentration and inflammatory cell infiltration in bronchoalveolar lavage, and with perivascular oedema observed histologically. Pharmacological intervention demonstrated that the increase in MRI signal volume induced by compound 48/80 24 h after challenge was blocked by disodium cromoglycate and the glucocorticoid, budesonide. Pretreatment with wortmannin, capsazepine, DNK333 (a dual neurokinin (NK) 1 and NK2 antagonist) or the anti-allergy drug CGS8515, but not indomethacin, resulted in partial inhibition. Conclusions and implications: Compound 48/80 induced a complex inflammatory reaction which did not solely involve mast cell degranulation but also activation of sensory nerves and was qualitatively similar to allergen challenge. Changes observed by MRI correlated with decreases in protein concentration in BAL fluid. However, the magnitude of the changes detected was greater using MRI. Our results demonstrate that MRI is a sensitive and efficient tool to assess the effects of drugs on lung inflammation.

Ultrasonography and stimulating perineural catheters for nerve blocks: a review of the evidence	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ANAESTHESIA-JOURNAL CANADIEN D ANESTHESIE			English	Review							BRACHIAL-PLEXUS BLOCK; CONTINUOUS REGIONAL ANALGESIA; POSTOPERATIVE PAIN-CONTROL; DELIVERY RATE ACCURACY; ULTRASOUND GUIDANCE IMPROVES; HALLUX-VALGUS REPAIR; FEMORAL NERVE; NONSTIMULATING CATHETERS; EPIDURAL-ANESTHESIA; RANDOMIZED-TRIAL	Purpose: This narrative review summarizes the evidence derived from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) offering blinded assessment and sample size justification, in order to determine the benefits associated with adjunctive ultrasonography (US) and stimulating perineural catheters for nerve blocks. Source: The literature search for this review was conducted during the second week of December 2007 using the MEDLINE (January 1950 to November 2007) and EMBASE (January 1980 to November 2007) databases. For US-guided peripheral and neuraxial blocks, the following medical subject heading (MeSH) terms were searched: "nerve block", "epidural anesthesia", "epidural analgesia", "epidural injection", "epidural space", "spinal anesthesia", and "spinal injection", the results were combined with "ultrasonography" (MeSH term) and "ultrasound" (key word). For stimulating perineural catheters, the following MeSH terms were cross referenced with the MeSH term, "nerve block": "peripheral catheterization", "indwelling catheterization", "catheterization", and keywords, "nerve catheter" and "continuous". Subsequently, the result of this search was combined to "stimulating" (key word). Fifteen RCTs, offering blinded assessment and sample size justification, were retained for analysis. Principal findings: For axillary blocks, US guidance yields a higher success rate than a double-injection, transarterial and a triple-injection, neurostimulation-guided technique. Compared to a quadruple-stimulation technique, no major differences can be found. The addition of nerve stimulation to US guidance offers no clear benefits for axillary blocks. For femoral blocks, compared to neurostimulation, echoguidance is associated with a local anesthetic (LA) sparing effect (up to 42%). In children, US guidance yields a LA sparing effect and a longer duration of action for lower extremity nerve blocks. Compared to their blind counterparts, stimulating catheters seem to offer limited clinical benefits. Despite providing a sparing effect on LA and opioid consumption, stimulating catheters are not associated with a decrease in side effects or analgesia-related expenditures. Conclusions: Published reports of RCTs provide evidence to formulate limited recommendations regarding the use of adjunctive US and stimulating perineural catheters. Further well-designed and meticulously executed RCTs are warranted.	[Tran, De Q.

Childhood absence epilepsy requiring more than one medication for seizure control	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF NEUROLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article							CHILDREN; CLASSIFICATION; FEATURES; ONSET	Introduction: Absence epilepsy is the most common primary generalized epilepsy syndrome encountered in pediatric practice. Treatment is pharmacologically specific and usually successful with a single medication. The objective of this study was to identify any clinical or electroencephalographic features at initial presentation in a consecutive cohort of children with absence epilepsy that may be associated with the need for a second medication. Methods: A computerized pediatric neurology database (1991-2007 inclusive) was retrospectively searched for all patients with typical absence seizures, 3 Hz spike and wave on EEG and no apparent symptomatic etiology who were over the age of two years at seizure onset with at least one year of follow-up. All such children were then divided into two groups; a) those requiring a single medication for seizure control (Group 1), and b) those requiring two medications for seizure control despite optimal management with the initial medication as determined by serum drug monitoring (Group 2). Clinical and electrographic features evident at diagnosis were then contrasted between Group 1 and 2. Results: Seventy-five children with absence seizures were initially identified with 52 meeting the study's inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria. Of these 52 children, 43 required a single medication for seizure control (Group 1), while 9 required two or more medications for seizure control (Group 2). A significant difference (p<0.05) was apparent between Group 1 and 2 with respect to gender (16/43 males vs 8/9 males) and mean age of diagnosis (8.19 years +/- 3.00 vs 6.06 years +/- 2.22). Age of onset of seizures, interval duration of seizures prior to treatment initiation, duration of seizures, presence of automatisms, family history, presence of co-morbid conditions and EEG findings were not found to be significantly different between the two Groups. Conclusions: Male gender and an earlier age of diagnosis is associated with the need for two medications for seizure control in children with absence epilepsy. This observation may suggest the need for more intensive early programmatic follow-up for young male children with newly diagnosed absence epilepsy to effect more rapid attainment of seizure control.

Methods: A prospective, longitudinal study of a cohort of elderly subjects with amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). Ninety subjects meeting the criteria for amnestic MCI were recruited and followed annually for an average of 3.3 years. Main outcome measure was the development of dementia determined by clinical assessment with confirmatory neuropsychological evaluation. Results: Fifty patients (56%) developed dementia on follow-up. They were older, had lower Mini-mental status exam (MMSE) scores and a shorter duration of symptoms at the time of first assessment. Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified age at symptom onset as the only clinical parameter which distinguished the group that deteriorated to dementia from the group that did not. The odds ratio for age was 1.1 (confidence interval 1.04 - 1.18). Conclusions: Patients presenting with amnestic MCI insufficient for the diagnosis of dementia are at high risk of developing dementia on follow-up. In our cohort, 56% were diagnosed with dementia over an average period of 5.9 years from symptom onset. The only clinical predictor for the eventual development of dementia was older age at symptom onset. Clinical features alone were insufficient to predict development of dementia.

Objective: Define the full phenotypic spectrum of a new mutation in the LMNA gene causing limb girdle muscular dystrophy type 1B. Methods: We identified a large French Canadian family with the LGMD 1B phenotype and a cardiac conduction disease phenotype that carried a new mutation in the LMNA gene and sought to define its full phenotypic spectrum by performing complete neurological and cardiac evaluations, muscle biopsy, RNA and DNA studies. Results: The proband and 12 living at risk relatives were tested. In total, we identified seven carriers of a new (IVS9-3C>G) LMNA gene mutation. Of the three symptomatic patients, all had cardiac involvement, but only two presented proximal limb weakness. The one available muscle biopsy demonstrated a normally expressed lamin A/C protein, localized at the nuclear envelope. RNA study revealed a loss of exon 10 transcription caused by the IVS9-3C to G splicing mutation. Conclusions: We have identified a new mutations in the LMNA gene in a French-Canadian family. This diagnosis has important implications for affected patients and their siblings since they may eventually require pacemaker implantation.

The main goal of this preliminary study was to prospectively record all violent incidents committed by chronic inpatients with schizophrenia (Sz) using a validated instrument. A secondary objective was to confirm that a majority of violent inward incidents were not commonly serious and committed by a minority of recidivistic individuals suffering from neurological damage (ND). Method: The French version of the Modified Overt Aggression Scale was introduced in all wards of a maximum security hospital to describe every violent incident committed by patients (n = 116) with diagnoses of Sz, Sz and ND, or Sz and mental retardation (MR) during a 6-month period (24 hours a day, 7 days a week). Results: Fifty-seven percent of aggressive acts were committed by 15% of patients who were more likely to receive additional diagnoses of ND or MR. Violent patients with Sz and ND were involved in 6 incidents for each individual on average, although most of the incidents were verbal in nature (68%). A high rate (28%) of patients with Sz, without evidence of ND or MR, had assaulted someone at least once during the study period. Conclusions: These results explain in part the high diversity of previous violent rate reviews and support the notion that inward repetitive violence might be more closely related with ND and impulsivity than psychopathology.

These processes can be distinguished by their composition in microtubule-associated proteins, the high molecular weight MAP2 proteins (HMWMAP2) being found in the dendrites and tau proteins in the axon. It is believed that the main contribution of HMWMAP2 to the acquisition and maintenance of dendrites is to promote microtubule assembly and stability. However, recent studies force us to enlarge our view on how HMWMAP2 might contribute to defining the role of the dendritic microtubules. The purpose of this article is to convey our view that HMWMAP2 are important players in defining the contribution of microtubules to dendritic identity by anchoring membranous organelles and signaling proteins to the dendritic microtubules and by being a receptor for neurosteroids.

Central inflammation induced by intracerebroventricular injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) increased USV induced by an air current focused on the head and this was abolished by morphine and ketorolac, suggesting a nociceptive component. USV in naive rats were unaffected. Diazepam reduced USV in both inflamed and naive rats. The triptans, zolmitriptan and sumatriptan, both reduced USV in inflamed but not in naive rats, as did dihydroergotamine, and the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) antagonists alpha CGRP((8-37)) and BIBN4096BS. The neurokinin-1 antagonist L-733-060 had no effect in either inflamed or naive rats when given after induction of inflammation, but when given with the LPS it prevented the augmentation of USV. This profile of activity of agents proven to be effective in the clinic suggests this model can be used to predict novel therapeutic agents for migraine.	[Martino, G.; Perkins, M.

Despite this, co-infected patients have low rates of HCV treatment initiation and completion. This is in large part due to the risk of pegylated-interferon alpha (PEG-WN-alpha)-related neuropsychiatric complications. We describe the design of a multicentre randomized, placebo-controlled trial that evaluates whether antidepressant prophylaxis is superior to early detection and treatment of depression in increasing the successful completion of HCV therapy. Seventy-six HIV+ adults with chronic HCV infection requiring therapy and with no contraindications to PEG-IFN-alpha/ribavirin will be randomized in a 1: 1 ratio to receive citalopram or placebo starting three weeks prior to HCV treatment. A novel aspect of the trial design is the built-in management of emergent depression while maintaining the blinded treatment assignment. This will permit the comparison of prophylactic versus therapeutic use of citalopram. The primary outcome is the average proportion of prescribed PEG-IFN-alpha and ribavirin doses taken per month at weeks 12 and 24, and will be compared between treatment arms. The study will also compare the development of moderate-to-severe depression between treatment arms. A unique feature of this trial will be the use of Telepsychiatry to standardize observer-administered neuropsychiatric evaluations. Assessments of anxiety, quality of life, and adherence to therapy, as well as pathogenetic studies of neuropsychiatric side effects, will be conducted. Intention-to-treat analyses using random regression modeling will be employed to analyze longitudinal data on prescribed PEG-IFN-alpha and ribavirin doses. Survival analyses will be used to compare the time to the development of depression between the two arms. Effective prevention of a broad range of ncuropsychiatric symptoms by citalopram has the potential to diminish PEG-EFN-ot associated morbidity and consequently, allow a greater number of patients to complete full therapy.

Transcription factor expression in the developing human fetal endocrine pancreas	DIABETOLOGIA			English	Article						human fetal pancreas; islet transcription factors; microarray analysis; qRT-PCR analysis	BETA-CELL DIFFERENTIATION; C-KIT; ISLET; GENE; PROLIFERATION; NEUROGENIN3; GENERATION; PCR	Aims/hypothesis Morphological changes that occur during pancreatic endocrine cell differentiation have been shown in rodent systems to be dependent on sequential alterations in transcription factor expression. However, similar data for humans have been limited. The aim of the present study was to provide a connection between pancreatic morphology, transcription factor gene expression and protein localisation during human fetal development. Methods Human fetal pancreases were examined at early (8-12 weeks of fetal age), middle (14-16 weeks) and late (19-21 weeks) stages, using immunohistological, microarray and qRT-PCR analyses. Results We observed a significant decrease in pancreatic duodenal homeobox 1 (PDX-1)(+)/cytokeratin 19(+) cells (p < 0.001), with a simultaneous increase in PDX-1(+)/insulin(+) cells from 8 to 21 weeks (p < 0.05). Increased PDX-1/insulin co-localisation within islet clusters was noted, while no co-expression of PDX-1 with glucagon was found, suggesting that loss of PDX-1 is essential for alpha cell formation. Given that neurogenin 3 (NGN3) expression is critical for establishing the endocrine cell programme in the rodent pancreas, we examined its expression pattern and co-localisation in PDX-1(+), insulin(+) and glucagon(+) cells. Co-localisation of NGN3 with PDX-1, insulin and glucagon was noted during early development, with significant decreases in middle and late stages (p < 0.001). Our microarray and co-localisation analyses of transcription factors linked to NGN3 demonstrated that ISL1 transcription factor (ISL1), neurogenic differentiation 1 (NEUROD1), NK2 related transcription factor related, locus 2 (NKX2-2) and paired box gene 6 (PAX6) were upregulated during development and present in all four endocrine cell types, while NK6 related transcription factor related, locus 1 (NKX6-1) was expressed exclusively in beta cells. Conclusions/interpretation This study is an important step towards identifying key molecular factors involved in development of the human fetal endocrine pancreas.

Representatives from a number of pregnancy cohort studies in North America and Europe presented options for measuring various endocrine-sensitive endpoints in early life and discussed issues related to performing and using those measures. The workshop focused on measuring reproductive tract developmental endpoints [e.g., anogenital distance (AGD)], endocrine status, and infant anthropometry. To the extent possible, workshop participants strove to develop or recommend standardized measurements that would allow comparisons and pooling of data across studies. The recommended outcomes include thigh fat fold, breast size, vaginal cytology, AGD, location of the testis, testicular size, and growth of the penis, with most of the discussion focusing on the genital exam. Although a number of outcome measures recommended during the genital exam have been associated with exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals, little is known about how predictive these effects are of later reproductive health or other chronic health conditions.

J	Fortin, MC; Bouchard, M; Carrier, G; Dumas, P				Fortin, Marie-Chantale; Bouchard, Michele; Carrier, Gaetan; Dumas, Pierre			Biological monitoring of exposure to pyrethrins and pyrethroids in a metropolitan population of the Province of Quebec, Canada	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH			English	Article						pesticides; pyrethroids; biological monitoring; urine; biomarkers	HUMAN DOSE-EXCRETION; INSECTICIDES; METABOLITES; CHANNELS; NEUROTOXICITY; CYPERMETHRIN; PERMETHRIN; URINE	Pyrethroid and pyrethrins are neurotoxic insecticides widely used to control agricultural and domestic insect pests. The general population is potentially chronically exposed through food consumption, but the actual exposure is poorly documented in Canada. This study aimed at obtaining an indication of the absorption of those insecticides in residents of Montreal Island, the largest metropolitan area of the Province of Quebec, Canada. We randomly recruited 120 adults and 120 children aged 18-64 and 6-12 years old, of which 81 adults and 89 children completed the study. The absorption of pyrethroids and pyrethrins was assessed through measurements of six urinary metabolites: chrysanthemum dicarboxylic acid (CDCA), cis- and trans-2,2-(dichlorovinyl)-2,2-dimethylcyclopropane carboxylic acids (cDCCA and tDCCA), cis-2,2-(dibromovinyl)-2,2-dimethylcyclopropane carboxylic acid (DBCA), 3-phenoxybenzoic acid (PBA) and 4-fluoro-3-phenoxybenzoic acid (FPBA). Metabolites were determined in 12-h urine collections for children and 2-consecutive 12-h collections for adults, and were analyzed by gas-chromatography/mass spectrometry. In both adults and children, the relative distribution of the various metabolites was as follows: tDCCA>PBA>cDCCA>CDCA>DBCA>FPBA. In adults, median (95th percentiles) cumulative amounts of these metabolites were 12.0 (231.1), 8.2 (177.9), 5.0 (110.1), 0.3 (8.2), 0.1 (4.7) and 0.1 (0.5)pmol/kg bw, respectively, in nighttime 12-h urine collections. Corresponding values in children were 12.6 (207.7), 10.2 (73.2), 5.1 (59.6), 2.1 (14.2), 0.1 (4.9) and 0.1 (0.8) pmol/kg bw. The main metabolites observed are indicative of exposure mainly to permethrin and cypermethrin and amounts absorbed are in the same range in adults and children. The distribution levels of the main metabolites in our sample also appeared similar to those reported in the US population. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

However, the evidence from both human and animal studies as to whether estrogen is pro- or anti -nociceptive is inconsistent. We have used a model of functional abdominal pain in mice to examine the role of estrogen in the modulation of a hyperalgesic state induced by ovariectomy. C57/BL6 female mice were either ovariectomized (OVX), received the same surgery without removing the ovaries or were tested without any surgical procedure. Mechanical hyperalgesia was assessed by von Frey filaments and thermal pain was measured using a hot-plate at 50 degrees C. OVX mice, but not sham-operated, developed mechanical hyperalgesia localized to the abdominal region, the hindlimbs and the proximal tail, 4-5 weeks after OVX as well as a reduction in response latency to the hot plate. OVX animals were implanted with 17 beta-estradiol pellets or with similar pellets with no hormone five weeks after OVX, when the hyperalgesic state was fully developed, and the estrogen reversed both mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia. Vaginal smears were taken to record the phase of the cycle at the time of the test from all animals and no significant differences were detected in mechanical hyperalgesia or in thermal pain threshold between normal animals in different phases of their estrous cycle. These results show that OVX induces a hyperalgesic state of slow onset and long duration that can be reversed by estrogen. We have also observed no estrous cycle modulation of pain sensitivity in normal animals. (C) 2007 European Federation of Chapters of the International Association for the Study of Pain.

Physicians need tools to accurately estimate the risk of recurrence and cancer-specific mortality to recommend individualized therapy and to design appropriate clinical trials. Methods: A MEDLINE literature search was performed on bladder cancer nomograms from January 1966 to July 2007. We recorded input variables, prediction form, number of patients used to develop the prediction tools, the outcome being predicted, prediction tool-specific features, predictive accuracy, and whether validation was performed. Each prediction tool was classified into patient clinical disease state and the outcome being predicted. Results: The literature search generated 11 published prediction tools that may be applied to patients in various clinical stages of bladder cancer. Of the 11 prediction tools, 8 have undergone validation. The following considerations need to be applied when designing and judging predictive models: predictive accuracy (internal and external validation), calibration, generalizability (reproducibility and transportability), and level of complexity, with the intent of determining whether the new model offers advantages relative to available alternatives. Studies comparing decision tools show that nomograms outperform other methodologies such as risk grouping. Conclusions: Nomograms provide the most accurate individualized risk estimations that facilitate management decisions. However, current nomograms still need to be refined. Potential advances may include the incorporation of biomarkers, validation in larger patient cohorts, and prospective data acquisition. (C) 2008 European Association of Urology.

The present study examined the effects of different degrees of semantic bias on speech perception in groups of younger and older listeners. Stimuli from two vertical bar g vertical bar-vertical bar k vertical bar voice onset time (VOT) continua were presented at the end of biasing and neutral sentences. Results indicated that context strongly influenced phonetic identification in older listeners; this was true for younger listeners only in the case of less-than-ideal stimuli. Findings are discussed in relation to theories concerning age-related changes in speech processing.

Trunk antagonist co-activation is associated with impaired neuromuscular performance	EXPERIMENTAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						isometric trunk exertion; trunk muscle recruitment; force variability; fatigue; spine stability	LOW-BACK-PAIN; MUSCLE COCONTRACTION; IMPEDANCE CONTROL; FATIGUE; ACTIVATION; STABILITY; NOISE; ELECTROMYOGRAPHY; CONTRACTIONS; VARIABILITY	The goal of this paper was to determine if trunk antagonist activation is associated with impaired neuromuscular performance. To test this theory, we used two methods to impair neuromuscular control: strenuous exertions and fatigue. Force variability (standard deviation of force signal) was assessed for graded isometric trunk exertions (10, 20, 40, 60, 80% of max) in flexion and extension, and at the start and end of a trunk extensor fatiguing trial. Normalized EMG signals for five trunk muscle pairs (RA rectus abdominis, EO external oblique, IO internal oblique, TE thoracic erector spinae, and LE lumbar erector spinae) were collected for each graded exertion, and at the start and end of a trunk extensor fatiguing trial. Force variability increased for more strenuous exertions in both flexion (P < 0.001) and extension (P < 0.001), and after extensor fatigue (P < 0.012). In the flexion direction, both antagonist muscles (TE and LE) increased activation for more strenuous exertions (P < 0.001). In the extension direction, all antagonist muscles except RA increased activation for more strenuous exertions (P < 0.05) and following fatigue (P < 0.01). These data demonstrate a strong relationship between force variability and antagonistic muscle activation, irrespective of where this variability comes from. Such antagonistic co-activation increases trunk stiffness with the possible objective of limiting kinematic disturbances due to greater force variability.	[Reeves, N.

Neuronal correlates of spontaneous fluctuations in fMRI signals in monkey visual cortex: Implications for functional connectivity at rest	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING			English	Article						BOLD; functional MRI; neurophysiology; resting state; spontaneous activity; functional connectivity; monkey; visual cortex	CEREBRAL-BLOOD-FLOW; HUMAN BRAIN; OXYGEN-CONSUMPTION; BOLD SIGNAL; SENSORY STIMULATION; NEGATIVE BOLD; ALPHA-RHYTHM; ACTIVATION; RESPONSES; EEG	Recent studies have demonstrated large amplitude spontaneous fluctuations in functional-MRI (fMRI) signals in humans in the resting state. Importantly, these spontaneous fluctuations in blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) signal are often synchronized over distant parts of the brain, a phenomenon termed functional-connectivity. Functional-connectivity is widely assumed to reflect interregional coherence of fluctuations in activity of the underlying neuronal networks. Despite the large body of human imaging literature on spontaneous activity and functional-connectivity in the resting state, the link to underlying neural activity remains tenuous. Through simultaneous fMRI and intracortical neurophysiological recording, we demonstrate correlation between slow fluctuations in BOLD signals and concurrent fluctuations in the underlying locally measured neuronal activity. This correlation varied with time-lag of BOLD relative to neuronal activity, resembling a traditional hemodynamic response function with peaks at similar to 6 s lag of BOLD signal. The correlations were reliably detected when the neuronal signal consisted of either the spiking rate of a small group of neurons, or relative power changes in the multi-unit activity band, and particularly in the local field potential gamma band. Analysis of correlation between the voxel-by-voxel fMRI time-series and the neuronal activity measured within one cortical site showed patterns of correlation that slowly traversed cortex. BOLD fluctuations in widespread areas in visual cortex of both hemispheres were significantly correlated with neuronal activity from a single recording site in V1. To the extent that our VI findings can be generalized to other cortical areas, fMRI-based functional-connectivity between remote regions in the resting state can be linked to synchronization of slow fluctuations in the underlying neuronal signals.

Here we report 42 novel RASA1 mutations and the associated phenotype in 44 families. The penetrance and de novo occurrence were high. All affected individuals presented multifocal capillary malformations (CMs), which represent the hallmark of the disorder. Importantly, one-third had fast,flow vascular lesions. Among them, we observed severe intracranial AVMs, including vein of Galen aneurysmal malformation, which were symptomatic at birth or during infancy, extracranial AVM of the face and extremities, and Parkes Weber syndrome (PKWS), previously considered sporadic and nongenetic. These fast-flow lesions can be differed from the other two genetic AVMs seen in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) and in phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) hamartomatous tumor syndrome. Finally, some CM-AVM patients had neural tumors reminiscent of neurofibromatosis type 1 or 2. This is the first extensive study on the phenotypes associated with RASA1 mutations, and unravels their wide heterogeneity.

It also examined the impact of leader personality on group need satisfaction. Groups (45) of 4 college women participated in a task, with 1 member designated "leader." Multilevel modeling revealed significant between- and within- groups relations. Individuals in groups with higher need satisfaction reported greater pleasant affect, intrinsic motivation, and satisfaction with group performance. In addition, individuals whose need satisfaction was higher than their group's average reported greater intrinsic motivation, pleasant affect, and performance satisfaction. Group need satisfaction was found to be lower under neurotic leaders and higher under agreeable, introverted leaders. Implications for group environments are discussed.

This study was designed to study the effects of the surface coating of a hollow fiber membrane oxygenator on coagulation, inflammation markers, and clinical outcomes. The biomaterials used to coat the membrane include heparin, polyethylene oxide chains (PEO), and sulfate/sulfonate groups. The coated membrane was compared to an uncoated oxygenator made of polypropylene. Methods: Two hundred patients who were scheduled to undergo valve repair and/or replacement surgery with or without coronary surgery were enrolled in the study. The patients were randomized to undergo CPB with either the Avecor oxygenator with Trillium (TM) (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN, USA), a biopassive surface, or the Monolyth (Sorin, Irvine, CA, USA) oxygenator without coating. The primary and secondary endpoints were the differences between these oxygenators in regard to patients' biochemistry, coagulation profiles, inflammatory mediators, and clinical outcomes, including blood loss and neurological events. Results: There were no differences between the two groups in terms of biochemistry, coagulation profile, inflammatory mediator release, and blood loss. Five patients in the Avecor group showed clinical evidence of a stroke confirmed with computerized tomography (CT) scan imaging, and none in the noncoated oxygenator group. Conclusion: The oxygenator Avecor offers similar results in terms of inflammation and coagulation profiles and blood loss during valvular surgery compared to a standard uncoated control oxygenator. The rate of neurological events was unusually elevated in the former group of patients, with only speculative explanation at this point. Further studies are warranted to clarify this aspect.

Regionally selective changes in neurotransmitter receptors in the brain of the 5-HT1B knockout mouse	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL NEUROANATOMY			English	Article						dopamine receptors; dopamine transporter; opioid receptors; GABA receptors; psychostimulants	VENTRAL TEGMENTAL AREA; MEDIATED PRESYNAPTIC INHIBITION; ACTIVATED G-PROTEINS; INDUCED PHASE-SHIFTS; GAMMA-S BINDING; RAT-BRAIN; MESSENGER-RNA; SUPRACHIASMATIC NUCLEUS; SEROTONIN-TRANSPORTER; MICE LACKING	The serotonin(1B) receptor knockout (5-HT1B KO) mouse is a valuable animal model of addiction to psychostimulants. We previously found selective increases in dopamine (DA) turnover in the nucleus accumbens of these mice, in addition to several changes in their central serotonin system. Here, we searched for further DA adaptations by measuring D-1 and D-2 receptor as well DA plasma membrane transporter (DAT) sites by ligand binding autoradiography, and G-protein coupling to D-1 and D-2 receptors by [S-35]GTP gamma S autoradiography. Except for a slight increase in the lateral septum, D-1 receptor binding did not differ from wild-type in twenty-one other neocortical, limbic or basal ganglia regions examined in the KO. Nor were there changes in D-1 agonist-stimulated G-protein coupling in any of these regions, including the lateral septum. Increases in D-2 binding sites, presumably involving GABAergic projection neurons, were measured in the nucleus accumbens, olfactory tubercle and ventral tegmental area of the 5-HT1B KO. However, no activation of the efficacy of D-2 receptor coupling to G-protein could be measured in these and other brain regions. Binding to DAT was unchanged throughout brain. Because of their implication in cocaine addiction, the functionality of mu-opioid and GABA(B) receptors was also assessed by [S-35]GTP gamma S autoradiography. 5-HT1B KO showed selective decreases in G-protein coupling to mu-opioid receptors in the paraventricular thalamic nucleus, and to GABA(B) receptors in the basolateral nucleus of amygdala. It is likely that these latter changes underlie some aspects of the addictive behavior of the 5-HT1B KO mouse. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Four patients diagnosed as having Guillain-Barre syndrome and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis during the same hospitalization are described herein. Two patients manifest an atypical form of Guillain-Barre syndrome, with magnetic resonance imaging of the head showing acute disseminated encephalomyelitis. A third patient has acute disseminated encephalomyelitis and develops Guillain-Barre syndrome during his hospitalization. A fourth patient demonstrates transverse myelitis that evolves into Guillain-Barre syndrome, with demyelination seen on brain magnetic resonance imaging. All patients are treated with intravenous immunoglobulins or corticosteroids. Three patients have a favorable outcome; 1 patient has a chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy. GuillainBarre syndrome and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis can occur simultaneously in the pediatric population. This may be explained by a shared epitope between peripheral and central nervous system myelin. Further research is necessary to better describe this entity and its prognosis.

Treatment of adrenocorticotropin-dependent Cushing's syndrome: A consensus statement	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ENDOCRINOLOGY & METABOLISM			English	Review							PPAR-GAMMA RECEPTOR; TERM-FOLLOW-UP; BILATERAL LAPAROSCOPIC ADRENALECTOMY; SOMATOSTATIN ANALOG SMS-201-995; GROWTH-HORMONE-SECRETION; TRANS-SPHENOIDAL SURGERY; TRANSSPHENOIDAL SURGERY; NELSONS-SYNDROME; PITUITARY IRRADIATION; MEDICAL THERAPY	Objective: Our objective was to evaluate the published literature and reach a consensus on the treatment of patients with ACTH-dependent Cushing's syndrome, because there is no recent consensus on the management of this rare disorder. Participants: Thirty-two leading endocrinologists, clinicians, and neurosurgeons with specific expertise in the management of ACTH-dependent Cushing's syndrome representing nine countries were chosen to address 1) criteria for cure and remission of this disorder, 2) surgical treatment of Cushing's disease, 3) therapeutic options in the event of persistent disease after transsphenoidal surgery, 4) medical therapy of Cushing's disease, and 5) management of ectopic ACTH syndrome, Nelson's syndrome, and special patient populations. Evidence: Participants presented published scientific data, which formed the basis of the recommendations. Opinion shared by a majority of experts was used where strong evidence was lacking. Consensus Process: Participants met for 2 d, during which there were four chaired sessions of presentations, followed by general discussion where a consensus was reached. The consensus statement was prepared by a steering committee and was then reviewed by all authors, with suggestions incorporated if agreed upon by the majority. Conclusions: ACTH-dependent Cushing's syndrome is a heterogeneous disorder requiring a multidisciplinary and individualized approach to patient management. Generally, the treatment of choice for ACTH-dependent Cushing's syndrome is curative surgery with selective pituitary or ectopic corticotroph tumor resection. Second-line treatments include more radical surgery, radiation therapy (for Cushing's disease), medical therapy, and bilateral adrenalectomy. Because of the significant morbidity of Cushing's syndrome, early diagnosis and prompt therapy are warranted.	[Biller, B. M.

Mutations in the nervous system-specific HSN2 exon of WNK1 cause hereditary sensory neuropathy type II	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL INVESTIGATION			English	Article							PROTEIN-KINASE; BLOOD-PRESSURE; GENE; CELLS; EXPRESSION; MICE; HYPERTENSION; LACKING; SUBSTRATE; SENSATION	Hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy type II (HSANII) is an early-onset autosomal recessive disorder characterized by loss of perception to pain, touch, and heat due to a loss of peripheral sensory nerves. Mutations in hereditary sensory neuropathy type II (HSN2), a single-exon ORF originally identified in affected families in Quebec and Newfoundland, Canada, were found to cause HSANII We report here that HSN2 is a nervous system-specific exon of the with-no-lysine(K)-1 (WNK1) gene. WNK1 mutations have previously been reported to cause pseudohypoaldosteronism type 11 but have not been studied in the nervous system. Given the high degree of conservation of WNK1 between mice and humans, we characterized the structure and expression patterns of this isoform in mice. Immunodetections indicated that this Wnk1/Hsn2 isoform was expressed in sensory components of the peripheral nervous system and CNS associated with relaying sensory and nociceptive signals, including satellite cells, Schwann cells, and sensory neurons. We also demonstrate that the novel protein product of Wnk1/Hsn2 was more abundant in sensory neurons than motor neurons. The characteristics of WNK1/HSN2 point to a possible role for this gene in the peripheral sensory perception deficits characterizing HSANII.

This led to the massive vaccination of host poultry, resulting in a Fujian-like variant (vFJ) resistant to immunization with two mutations at the furin-processing site of hemagglutinin: loss of the P2 Lys and P9 substitution of Gln to Leu within the cleavage site. We synthesized 14mer peptides mimicking the processing site of Fujian-like strains. We found that the peptide with the vFJ sequence is less cleaved as compared to the parent FJ-derived peptide by furin at either neutral or acidic pH values. We hypothesize that the double hemagglutinin mutations in vFJ may result in viruses with less processed hemagglutinin, thereby providing a mechanism for evading immune neutralization.

We recently reported that CGRP and adrenomedullin act through distinct receptors to induce cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) accumulation in dispersed cells from embryonic rat spinal cord. Here, we investigated the apparent affinity and efficacy of adrenomedullin-2/intermedin for these receptors. Adrenomedullin-2/intermedin competed with [(125)I]-CGRP for binding to specific embryonic spinal cord cells with a pIC(50) of 9.73 +/- 0.06. Interestingly, adrenomedullin-2/intermedin competed for specific [(125)I]-adrenomedullin binding in a biphasic manner with pIC(50) of 9.03 +/- 0.22 and 6.45 +/- 0.24, respectively. Cellular levels of cAMP were increased by adrenomedullin-2/intermedin (pEC(50) 7.84 +/- 0.08) when cells were exposed to this peptide for 10 min at 37 degrees C. This effect was partially inhibited by the non-peptide antagonist BIBN4096BS (pA(2) 6.56 +/- 0.12), the adrenomedullin antagonist hAM(22-52) (pA(2) 6.36 +/- 0.30), and the adrenomedullin/CGRP antagonist CGRP(8-37) (pA(2) 7.24 +/- 0.60). More interestingly, a highly significant effect of adrenomedullin-2/intermedin on cAMP accumulation (pEC(50) 7.3 +/- 0.14) was still observed even in the presence of a mixture of saturating concentrations of BIBN4096BS, hAM(22-52), and the amylin antagonist AC187. Taken together, these data provide evidence for the possible existence of a distinct class of receptor sites for adrenomedullin-2/intermedin in embryonic rat spinal cord cells.

H-1 and C-13-NMR was used to investigate the effects of thiamine deficiency on the synthesis of amino acids derived from [1-C-13]glucose in vulnerable (medial thalamus; MT) compared to non-vulnerable (frontal cortex; FC) brain regions. Following 11 days of thiamine deficiency, a time-point associated with the absence of significant neuronal cell death, regional concentrations of glutamate, glutamine and GABA remained unaffected in FC and MT; however, decreased levels of aspartate in MT at this time-point were a predictor of regional vulnerability. De novo synthesis of glutamate and GABA were unaffected at 11 days of thiamine deficiency, while synthesis of [2-C-13]aspartate was significantly impaired. Glucose loading, which has been shown to exacerbate symptoms in patients with thiamine deficiency, resulted in further decreases of TCA cycle flux and reduced de novo synthesis of glutamate, aspartate and GABA in thiamine-deficient (TD) rats. Isotopomer analysis revealed that impaired TCA cycle flux and decreased aspartate synthesis due to thiamine deficiency occurred principally in neurons. Glucose loading deteriorated TD-related decreases in TCA cycle flux, and concomitantly reduced synthesis of aspartate and glutamate in MT.

To determine the precise distribution of EphA4 and EphB2 in mature brain synapses, we used subcellular fractionation and electron microscopy to examine the adult mouse forebrain/midbrain. EphA4 and EphB2 were both enriched in microsomes and synaptosomes. In synaptosomes, they were present in the membrane and the synaptic vesicle fractions. While EphA4 was tightly associated with PSD-95-enriched post-synaptic density fractions, EphB2 was easily extracted with detergents. In contrast, both receptors were found in the pre-synaptic active zone fraction. By electron microscopy, EphA4 was mainly detected in axon terminals, whereas EphB2 was more frequently detected in large dendritic shafts, in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex. However, in the ventrobasal thalamus, EphB2 was detected most frequently in axon terminals and thin dendritic shafts. The localization of EphA4 and EphB2 in multiple compartments of neurons and synaptic junctions suggests that they interact with several distinct scaffolding proteins and play diverse roles at synapses.

These drugs induce intracellular events that culminate in the transcription of immediate early genes, such as c-fos. Another class of transcription factors, namely, the nuclear receptor subgroup called Nurs (Nur77, Nurr1 and Nor-1), has recently been associated with behavioral and biochemical effects mediated by dopamine. However, the signaling cascade leading to modulation of Nur mRNA levels in the brain has never been investigated. In the present study, we explore in vivo using specific kinase inhibitors the role of mitogen-associated and extracellular signal-regulated kinases (MEK) and protein kinase C (PKC) in the modulation of Nur expression induced by dopamine receptor drugs. Modulation of Nur77 expression by a dopamine D-2 receptor antagonist is associated with MEK and PKC activities, whereas only the PKC activity participates in the modulation of Nor-1 expression. Both MEK and PKC activities also participate in the modulation of Nur77 mRNA levels induced by dopamine receptor agonists, whereas a selective MEK activity is associated with the modulation of Nor-1 mRNA levels. Interestingly, modulation of dopamine drug-induced locomotor activities by kinase inhibitors is in accordance with the effects on Nur77, but not Nor-1, expression. Taken together, the results indicate that signaling events leading to modulation of Nur77 and Nor-1 expression following dopamine receptor interacting drugs are distinct. Considering that orphan nuclear receptors of the Nur subgroup display an important ligand-independent constitutive activity, characterization of the signaling cascades involved in the regulation of their expression represents an important step for understanding their role in dopamine system physiology and pathophysiology.

This phenomenon is associated with a reduced ability of CA3 to respond to entorhinal cortex inputs. Here, we describe a lesion that destroys the perforant path in CA3 after status epilepticus (SE) induced by pilocarpine injection in 8-week-old rats. Using magnetic resonance imaging, immunohistochemical, and ultrastructural analyses, we determined that this lesion develops after 30 minutes of SE and is characterized by microhemorrhages and ischemia. After a longer period of SE, the lesion invariably involves the upper blade of the dentate gyrus. Adult rats treated with subcutaneous diazepam (20 mg kg(-1) for 3 days) did not develop the dentate gyrus lesion and had less frequent spontaneous recurrent seizures (p < 0.01). Young (3-week-old) rats rarely (20%) developed the CA3 lesion, and their spontaneous seizures were delayed (p < 0.01). To investigate the role of the damaged CA3 in seizure activity, we reinduced SE in adult and young epileptic rats. Using FosB/Delta FosB markers, we found induction of FosB/Delta FosB immunopositivity in CA3 neurons of young but not in adult rats. These experiments indicate that SE can produce a focal lesion in the perforant path that may affect the roles of the hippocampus in epileptic rats.

Design and implementation of an automated partial volume correction in PET: Application to dopamine receptor quantification in the normal human striatum	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE			English	Article						PET; partial-volume correction; 3D ROI; automatic algorithm; striatum	IMAGE-ANALYSIS; BRAIN; SEGMENTATION; ATLAS; MODEL; VALIDATION; DISEASE; BINDING	The considerable effort and potential lack of reproducibility of human-driven PET quantification and partial volume correction (PVC) can be alleviated by use of atlas-based automatic analysis. The present study examined the application of a new algorithm designed to automatically define 3-dimensional regions of interest (ROIs) and their effect on dopamine receptor quantification in the normal human brain striatum, both without and with PVC. Methods: A total of 90 healthy volunteers (age range, 18-46 y) received a single injection of C-11-raclopride, and automatic segmentation of concomitant structural MR images was performed using a maximum-probability atlas in combination with a trained neural network. For each identified tissue segment considered homogeneous for the tracer (or volumes of interest [VOIs]), an a priori criterion based on minimum axial recovery coefficient (RCzmin = 50%, 75%, and 90%) was used to constrain the extent of each ROI. Results: With ROIs essentially overlapping the entire VOI volume (obtained with RCzmin = 50%), the binding potential (BPND) of C-11-raclopride was found to be around 2.2 for caudate and 2.9 for putamen, an underestimation by 35% and 28%, respectively, according to PVC values. At increased RCzmin, BPND estimates of C-11-raclopride were increased by 12% and 21% for caudate and 8% and 15% for putamen when the associated ROIs decreased to around 65% and 43% of total tissue volume (VOI) for caudate and 67% and 31% for putamen. After PVC, we observed relative increases in BPND variance of 12% for caudate and 20% for putamen, whereas estimated BPND values all increased to 3.4 for caudate and 4.0 for putamen, regardless of ROI size. Dopamine receptor concentrations appeared less heterogeneous in the normal human striatum after PVC than they did without PVC: the 25%-30% difference in BPND estimates observed between caudate and putamen remained significant after PVC but was reduced to slightly less than 20%. Furthermore, the results were comparable with those obtained with a manual method currently in use in our laboratory. Conclusion: The new algorithm allows for traditional PET data extraction and PVC in an entirely automatic fashion, thus avoiding labor-intensive analyses and potential intra- or interobserver variability. This study also offers the first, to our knowledge, large-scale application of PVC to dopamine D-2/D-3 receptor imaging with C-11-raclopride in humans.

Its prevalence is reported to be 20% among the adult population. Awake bruxism is mainly associated with nervous tic and reactions to stress. The physiology and pathology of awake bruxism is unknown, although stress and anxiety are considered to be risk factors. During sleep, awareness of tooth grinding (as noted by sleep partner or family members) is reported by 8% of the population. Sleep bruxism is a behaviour that was recently classified as a 'sleep-related movement disorder'. There is limited evidence to support the role of occlusal factors in the aetiology of sleep bruxism. Recent publications suggest that sleep bruxism is secondary to sleep-related micro-arousals (defined by a rise in autonomic cardiac and respiratory activity that tends to be repeated 8-14 times per hour of sleep). The putative roles of hereditary (genetic) factors and of upper airway resistance in the genesis of rhythmic masticatory muscle activity and of sleep bruxism are under investigation. Moreover, rhythmic masticatory muscle activity in sleep bruxism peaks in the minutes before rapid eye movement sleep, which suggests that some mechanism related to sleep stage transitions exerts an influence on the motor neurons that facilitate the onset of sleep bruxism. Finally, it remains to be clarified when bruxism, as a behaviour found in an otherwise healthy population, becomes a disorder, i.e. associated with consequences (e.g. tooth damage, pain and social/marital conflict) requires intervention by a clinician.

Study design Infants with CHDs who underwent surgical repair in infancy were recruited and assessed prospectively for developmental progress. At 5 years of age (64.2 +/- 11.3 months), 94 subjects were evaluated in a blind fashion by using a variety of standardized measures. Results Mean IQ scores were in the low average range (90-94). Receptive language was in the average range (103.6 +/- 14.4). Behavioral difficulties were common (27.1%), with internalizing problems being more frequent. Functional limitations in socialization (93.0 +/- 17.1), daily living skills (94.6 +/- 16.4), communi-cation (90.0 +/- 14.1), and adaptive behavior (92.1 +/- 15.8) were noted in 11% to 17% of children. With the Functional Independence Measure for Children, 20% to 22% of subjects were more dependent than their peers in self-care and social cognition, although few (4.5%) had mobility restrictions. Predictors of developmental and functional limitations included: abnormal postoperative neurologic examination, microcephaly, deep hypothermic circulatory arrest time, palliation, acyanotic heart lesion, age at surgery, and maternal education. Conclusions After infant open-heart surgery, children with CHDs may exhibit a range of developmental difficulties at school entry that enhances risk for learning challenges and decreased social participation.

Many neural computations rely on the fact that neurons call be tuned to specific stimulus frequencies. It is thus important to understand the mechanisms underlying frequency tuning. In the electrosensory system of the weakly electric fish, Apteronotus leptorhynchus, the primary processing of behaviourally relevant sensory signals Occurs in pyramidal neurons of the electrosensory lateral line lobe (ELL). These cells encode low frequency prey stimuli with bursts of spikes and high frequency communication signals with single spikes. We describe here flow bursting in pyramidal neurons call be regulated by intrinsic conductances in a cell Subtype specific fashion across the sensory Maps found within the ELL, thereby regulating their frequency tuning. Further, the neuromodulatory regulation of such conductances within individual cells and the consequences to frequency tuning are highlighted. Such alterations in the tuning of the pyramidal neurons may allow weakly electric fish to preferentially select for certain stimuli under various behaviourally relevant circumstances.

Design: An observational cohort study. Subjects: A cohort of 262 subjects (mean age 71.6 (standard deviation 12.5) years) hospitalized post-acute stroke. Methods: Functional assessments were made within 3 days of stroke with items from valid and reliable indices commonly utilized to evaluate stroke survivors. Information on important variables was also collected. Principal component and Rasch analysis confirmed the factor structure, and dimensionality of the measure. Rasch analysis combined items across ICF components to develop the measure. Items were deleted iteratively, those retained fit the model and were related to the construct; reliability and validity were assessed. Results: A 38-item unidimensional measure of the EPF met all Rasch model requirements. The item difficulty matched the person ability (mean person measure: -0.31; standard error 0.37 logits), reliability of the person-item-hierarchy was excellent at 0.97. Initial validity was adequate. Conclusion: The 38-item EPF measure was developed. It expands the range of assessment post acute stroke; it covers a broad spectrum of difficulty with good initial psychometric properties that, once revalidated, can assist in planning and evaluating early interventions.

These include general and cell-restricted factors, as well as factors that act as effectors of signaling pathways. We have previously defined in the distal POMC promoter a composite regulatory element that contains targets for basic helix-loop-helix TFs conferring cell specificity and for NGFI-B orphan nuclear receptors that are responsive to CRH signaling and to glucocorticoid negative feedback. These factors act on neighboring regulatory elements, the Ebox(Neuro) and NurRE, respectively. Currently, the Ebox(Neuro) is thought to be the target of NeuroD1 during fetal development, but this factor may not account for activity in the adult pituitary; it is also unknown whether the NurRE and NGFI-B-related factors are active before establishment of the hypothalamic-pituitary portal system. In order to assess the importance of these regulatory elements and their cognate TFs throughout pituitary organogenesis and in the adult, we have assessed the activity of mutant POMC promoters in transgenic mice throughout development. These experiments indicate that the Ebox(Neuro) and cognate basic helix-loop-helix factors are required throughout development and in the adult gland, beyond expression of NeuroD1. Similarly, the data reveal sustained importance of the NurRE and its cognate factors throughout pituitary development. These data contrast the sustained dependence throughout development on the same regulatory elements with the highly dynamic patterns of TF expression and the modulation of their activity in response to signaling pathways.

Methionine synthase reductase (MTRR) is required for activation of methionine synthase, a folate- and vitamin B-12-dependent enzyme. A polymorphism in MTRR (p.122M), present in the homozygous state in 25% of many populations, may increase risk for neural tube defects. To examine the impact of MTRR deficiency on early development and congenital heart defects, we used mice harboring a gene-trapped (gt) allele in Mtrr. Female mice (Mtrr(+/+), Mtrr(+/gt), and Mtrr(gt/gt)) were mated with male Mtrr(+/g) mice. Reproductive outcomes and cardiac phenotype (presence of defects and myocardial thickness) were assessed at E14.5. Mtrr-deficient mothers had more resorptions and more delayed embryos per litter (resorptions per litter: 0.29 +/- 0.13; 1.21 +/- 0.41; 1.87 +/- 0.38 and delayed embryos per litter: 0.07 +/- 0.07; 0.14 +/- 0.14; 0.60 +/- 0.24 in Mtrr(+/+), Mtrr(+/gt), and Mtrr(gt/gt) mothers respectively). Placentae of Mtrr(gt/gt) mothers were smaller and their embryos were smaller, with myocardial hypoplasia and a higher incidence of ventricular septal defects (VSD) per litter (0; 0.57 +/- 0.30; 1.57 +/- 0.67 in Mtrr(+/+), Mtrr(+/gt), and Mtrr(gt/gt) groups respectively). Embryonic Mtrr(gt/gt) genotype was associated with reduced embryonic length, reduced embryonic and placental weight, and higher incidence of VSD, but did not affect myocardial thickness or embryonic delay. We conclude that Mtrr deficiency adversely impacts reproductive outcomes and cardiac development in mice. These findings may have implications for nutritional prevention of heart defects, particularly in women with the common MTRR polymorphism.

To better understand the pathogenesis of this injury and the associated atrophy, we investigated volume loss over time in 20 WM fiber tracts. We defined two main aims: (1) to examine whether certain fiber tracts were more prone to atrophy, and to test the possible relation of tract atrophy to tract length and selected MS-specific variables; and (2) to investigate the possible relation of atrophy to lesion load (whole brain and in the specific tract). Local volume change was assessed between two distant time points for each MS patient studied. Fiber tracts were segmented automatically using a tractography-based atlas. Results demonstrate volume loss in all fiber tracts. The uncinate fasciculus and anterior-thalamic radiation had the greatest yearly percentage atrophy. Disease type, duration, median expanded disability status scale, total lesion load, and gender exhibited significant effects on atrophy in at least one tract. Together, these data are more consistent with a pathogenesis for the degeneration related to diffuse inflammation rather than the secondary effects of focal lesions.	[Kezele, I.

Furthermore, changes in the central processing of osmosensory signals are likely to affect the hydro-mineral balance and other related aspects of homeostasis, including thermoregulation and cardiovascular balance. Surprisingly little is known about how the brain orchestrates these responses. Here, recent advances in our understanding of the molecular, cellular and network mechanisms that mediate the central control of osmotic homeostasis in mammals are reviewed.

Reduced brain choline in homocystinuria due to remethylation defects	NEUROLOGY			English	Article							MAGNETIC-RESONANCE-SPECTROSCOPY; COMBINED METHYLMALONIC ACIDURIA; S-ADENOSYLHOMOCYSTEINE; MASS-SPECTROMETRY; GYRATE ATROPHY; CREATINE; METABOLISM; CHILDREN; IDENTIFICATION; DEFICIENCY	Objective: To investigate whether secondary impairment of the transmethylation pathway is a mechanism underlying the neurologic involvement in homocystinuria due to remethylation defects. Methods: Twelve patients with neurologic disease due to remethylation defects were examined by brain magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (H-1 MRSI). Brain N-acetylaspartate, cholinecontaining compounds (Cho), and creatine (Cr) were quantified and compared to with controls. Metabolites of remethylation cycle and creatine biosynthesis pathway were measured in plasma and urine. Results: MRSI revealed isolated Cho deficiency in all regions examined (mean concentration units +/- SD, patients vs controls): frontal white matter (0.051 +/- 0.010 vs 0.064 +/- 0.010; p +/- 0.001), lenticular nucleus (0.056 +/- 0.011 vs 0.069 +/- 0.009; p < 0.001), and thalamus (0.063 +/- 0.010 vs 0.071 +/- 0.007; p +/- 0.006). In contrast to controls, the Cho/Cr ratio decreased with age in patients in the three brain regions examined. Low creatine urinary excretion (p +/- 0.005), normal urine and plasma guanidinoacetate, and a paradoxical increase in plasma S-adenosylmethionine (p < 0.005) concentrations were observed. Conclusion: Patients with homocystinuria due to remethylation defects have an isolated brain choline deficiency, probably secondary to depletion of labile methyl groups produced by the transmethylation pathway. Although biochemical studies suggest mild peripheral creatine deficiency, brain creatine is in the reference range, indicating a possible compartmentation phenomenon. Paradoxical increase of S-adenosylmethionine suggests that secondary inhibition of methylases contributes to the transmethylation defect in these conditions.

Psychological stress also increases dopamine release and is thought to play a role in susceptibility to psychotic illness. We hypothesized that healthy individuals at elevated risk of developing psychosis would show greater striatal dopamine release than controls in response to stress. Using positron emission tomography and [C-11]raclopride, we measured changes in synaptic dopamine concentrations in 10 controls and 16 psychometric schizotypes; 9 with perceptual aberrations (PerAb, ie positive schizotypy) and 7 with physical anhedonia (PhysAn, ie negative schizotypy). [C-11] Raclopride binding potential was measured during a psychological stress task and a sensory-motor control. All three groups showed significant increases in self-reported stress and cortisol levels between the stress and control conditions. However, only the PhysAn group showed significant stress-induced dopamine release. Dopamine release in the entire sample was significantly negatively correlated with smooth pursuit gain, an endophenotype linked to frontal lobe function. Our findings suggest the presence of abnormalities in the dopamine response to stress in negative symptom schizotypy, and provide indirect evidence of a link to frontal function.

The aim of this study was to investigate: (1) the effects of a stroke on motor imagery vividness as measured by the Kinesthetic and Visual Imagery Questionnaire (KVIQ-20); (2) the influence of the lesion side; and (3) the symmetry of motor imagery. Methods. Thirty-two persons who had sustained a stroke, in the right (n = 19) or left (n = 13) cerebral hemisphere, and 32 age-matched healthy persons participated. The KVIQ-20 assesses on a 5-point ordinal scale the clarity of the image (visual scale) and the intensity of the sensations (kinesthetic scale) that the subjects are able to imagine from the first-person perspective. Results. In both groups, the visual scores were higher (P = .0001) than the kinesthetic scores and there was no group difference. Likewise, visual scores remained higher than kinesthetic scores irrespective of the lesion side. The visual scores poststroke were higher (P = .001) when imagining upper limb movements on the unaffected side than those on the affected side. When focusing on the lower limb only, however, the kinesthetic scores were higher (P = .001) when imagining movements of the unaffected compared to those on the affected side. Conclusions. The vividness of motor imagery poststroke remains similar to that of age-matched healthy persons and is not affected by the side of the lesion. However, after stroke motor imagery is not symmetrical and motor imagery vividness is better when imagining movements on the unaffected than on the affected side, indicating an overestimation possibly related to a hemispheric imbalance or a recalibration of motor imagery perception.

Mn-exposed individuals also report symptoms, including fatigue, mood changes, irritability, concentration difficulties, and sweating in the absence of physical effort. The long-term course of Mn-related symptoms after cessation of exposure has never been examined. Male workers from a Mn-alloy production plant participated in a study on nervous system functions (initial examination), and were followed-up 14 years after plant closure. The relation between self-reported symptoms and Mn cumulative exposure index (CEI) was examined among 71 Mn-alloy workers and 71 referents. Symptoms from the questionnaire were grouped into categories, and the reported frequency was compared between referents and Mn-alloy workers in each Mn CEI tertile using General Linear Models, controlling for age, education, and alcohol consumption. A gradual increase in symptoms frequency was observed for complaints related to hearing and movement control both at initial and follow-up examination, and fatigue and autonomic nervous system only at initial examination. In addition, an exposure-effect relation was apparent for symptoms related to memory, concentration and balance reported at both examinations, with Mn-workers in the highest CEI tertile reporting the highest level of symptomatology. Sleeping complaints were not associated with exposure to Mn, while musculoskeletal pain and muscular weakness were reported more often by Mn-workers than referents but were not clearly related to CEI. The findings suggest that former Mn-alloy workers continue to perceive symptoms many years after cessation of exposure. Despite the limitations of self-reported symptoms, subjective complaints are an important part of a health assessment since they relate directly to perceived health status and day-to-day functioning.

Some recent studies indicate adverse effects at relatively low exposure levels. In the present study, we used sensitive quantitative methods, developed specifically to detect subtle effects of exposure to toxins on motor function. After exclusion of individuals with neurological diseases or other conditions that may affect performance, 43 chloralkali workers with current low exposure to Hgo, and 22 age-matched referents remained for further analysis. The median urinary mercury concentration in exposed workers was 5.9 mu g/g (range 1.3-25) creatinine (mu g/gC), while that in referents was 0.7 mu g/gC (range 0.2-4.1). The mean exposure time was 15 years, and the median cumulative mercury index was 161 years x mu g/gC in exposed workers. A eurythmokinesimeter (EKM) was used to quantify eye-hand coordination, and a diadochokinesimeter, to measure rapid alternating rotation of the forearms. In general, the differences in performance between the exposed workers and the referents were small. Age was associated with a decrease in speed, more tremor, and longer contact duration between the stylus and the metal targets in performance of rapid pointing movements. Smokers had significantly more tremor, and more contacts per event in the EKM test, than nonsmokers. Taking age, shift work, and smoking habits into account, no significant associations with current or cumulative mercury exposure were found for the majority of the outcome variables from the quantitative tests. In general, this study indicates no significant adverse effects of Hgo on neuromotor function at the exposure levels studied. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Experimental studies of potential analgesics for the treatment of chemotherapy-evoked painful peripheral neuropathies	PAIN MEDICINE			English	Article						allodynia; amitriptyline; baclofen; calcium channels; chemotherapy; hyperalgesia; mexiletine; oxcarbazepine; neuropathic pain; paclitaxel; topiramate; tramadol	ACETYL-L-CARNITINE; CHRONIC CONSTRICTION INJURY; RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIAL; RAT MODEL; MECHANICAL ALLODYNIA; NERVE INJURY; NEUROSENSORY TOXICITY; DIABETIC-NEUROPATHY; ACUTE AMITRIPTYLINE; INFLAMMATORY PAIN	Objective. We investigated potential analgesics for chemo therapy-evoked neuropathic pain using rats treated with paclitaxel. Design. Drugs were tested in a repeated dosing paradigm (four daily injections). Topiramate was tested with a long-term treatment paradigm (12 days). A literature search was performed to summarize prior data. Measures. Mechanical stimulation of the hind paw was used to assay antiallodynic and antihyperalgesic effects acutely and 24 hours after injection. Results. Amitriptyline produced significant analgesia, but this was not apparent until after the second injection. Baclofen produced significant effects, but the response varied erratically. Mexiletine and NMED-126 (a mixed N- and T-type calcium channel blocker) produced consistent, significant analgesia when tested acutely, but the pain relief did not persist at 24 hours postinjection. Oxcarbazepine had no effect at any time. Tramadol produced consistent, near-complete analgesia when tested acutely, but the analgesia did not persist to 24 hours postinjection. Topiramate produced significant effects that were first evident after 6-8 days of dosing. Conclusions. The present data and data from the literature review suggest that there are several potential treatments for chemotherapy-evoked neuropathic pain. Nonsteriodal anti-inflammatory drugs have little or no efficacy. Opioids have an effect, but probably only with high doses. At least some antidepressants are analgesic in these conditions. Some, but clearly not all, anticonvulsants and sodium channel blockers have efficacy. Tramadol is a particularly promising candidate. Topiramate, acetyl-L-carnitine, carbamazepine, and venlafaxine may have protective or restorative effects. Clinical trials of these candidates are needed to advance the treatment of chemotherapy-evoked pain.

Their formation is influenced among other factors by the action of the trifunctional enzyme, 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase/5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolate cyclohydrolase/10-formyltetrahydrofolate synthetase (MTHFD1). Such roles of MTHFD1 render the respective gene an interesting candidate for susceptibility to diseases, affected by changes in folate levels, and for predisposition to nonbeneficial therapeutic responses to antifolate agents.

D0 Collaboration	Evidence for production of single top quarks	PHYSICAL REVIEW D			English	Review							BOOSTED DECISION TREES; W-GLUON FUSION; NEURAL-NETWORKS; FERMILAB-TEVATRON; PARTICLE IDENTIFICATION; BOSON PRODUCTION; ROOT-S=1.96 TEV; GAUGE BOSONS; SEARCH; COUPLINGS	We present first evidence for the production of single top quarks in the D0 detector at the Fermilab Tevatron p (p) over bar collider. The standard model predicts that the electroweak interaction can produce a top quark together with an antibottom quark or light quark, without the antiparticle top-quark partner that is always produced from strong-coupling processes. Top quarks were first observed in pair production in 1995, and since then, single top-quark production has been searched for in ever larger data sets. In this analysis, we select events from a 0.9 fb(-1) data set that have an electron or muon and missing transverse energy from the decay of a W boson from the top-quark decay, and two, three, or four jets, with one or two of the jets identified as originating from a b hadron decay. The selected events are mostly backgrounds such as W + jets and t (t) over bar events, which we separate from the expected signals using three multivariate analysis techniques: boosted decision trees, Bayesian neural networks, and matrix-element calculations. A binned likelihood fit of the signal cross section plus background to the data from the combination of the results from the three analysis methods gives a cross section for single top-quark production of sigma(p (p) over bar -> tb + X, tqb + X) = 4.7 +/- 1.3 pb. The probability to measure a cross section at this value or higher in the absence of signal is 0.014%, corresponding to a 3.6 standard deviation significance. The measured cross section value is compatible at the 10% level with the standard model prediction for electroweak top-quark production. We use the cross section measurement to directly determine the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa quark mixing matrix element that describes the Wtb coupling and find vertical bar V(tb)f(1)(L)vertical bar = 1.31(-0.21)(+0.25), where f(1)(L) is a generic vector coupling. This model-independent measurement translates into 0.68 <vertical bar V-tb vertical bar <= 1 at the 95% C.L. in the standard model.	[Abazov, V. M.; Alexeev, G. D.; Kalinin, A. M.; Kharzheev, Y.

The panel was charged with reviewing the current state of knowledge and uncertainty about naphthalene metabolism in relation to anatomy, physiology and cytotoxicity in tissues observed to have elevated tumor incidence in these rodent bioassays. Major conclusions reached concerning scientific claims of high confidence were that: (1) rat nasal tumor occurrence was greatly enhanced, if not enabled, by adjacent, histologically related focal cellular proliferation; (2) elevated incidence of mouse lung tumors occurred at a concentration (30 ppm) cytotoxic to the same lung region at which tumors occurred, but not at a lower and less cytotoxic concentration (tumorigenesis NOAEL = 10 ppm); (3;1 naphthalene cytotoxicity requires metabolic activation (unmetabolized naphthalene is not a proximate cause of observed toxicity or tumors); (4) there are clear regional and species differences in naphthalene bioactivation; and (5) target tissue anatomy and physiology is sufficiently well understood for rodents, non-human primates and humans to parameterize species-specific physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models for nasal and lung effects. Critical areas of uncertainty requiring resolution to enable improved human cancer risk assessment were considered to be that: (1) cytotoxic naphthalene metabolites, their modes of cytotoxic action, and detailed low-dose dose-response need to be clarified, including in primate and human tissues, and neonatal tissues; (2) mouse, rat, and monkey inhalation studies are needed to better define in vivo naphthalene uptake and metabolism in the upper respiratory tract; (3) in vivo validation studies are needed for a PBPK model for monkeys exposed to naphthalene by inhalation, coupled to cytotoxicity studies referred to above; and (4) in vivo studies are needed to validate a human PBPK model for naphthalene. To address these uncertainties, the Panel proposed specific research studies that should be feasible to complete relatively promptly. Concerning residual uncertainty far less easy to resolve, the Panel concluded that environmental, non-cytotoxic exposure levels of naphthalene do not induce tumors at rates that can be predicted meaningfully by simple linear extrapolation from those observed in rodents chronically exposed to far greater, cytotoxic naphthalene concentrations.

Predictors and profiles of treatment non-adherence and engagement in services problems in early psychosis	SCHIZOPHRENIA RESEARCH			English	Article						medication adherence; service engagement; psychosis; early psychosis; trauma; personality	1ST EPISODE PSYCHOSIS; MEDICATION REGIMENS; MENTAL-ILLNESS; CHILDHOOD TRAUMA; NON-ATTENDANCE; SCHIZOPHRENIA; DISORDERS; ADHERENCE; ATTACHMENT; OUTPATIENTS	Treatment adherence in early psychosis individuals is considered problematic. Some studies have tried to understand reasons for medication non-adherence in this population, though few have also considered engagement in services. We conducted a cross-sectional study with 118 early psychosis individuals, assessing multiple constructs (symptoms, insight, personality traits, alliance, childhood trauma, substance abuse, social functioning and sociodemographics) suggested in the literature as potentially linked to medication adherence or engagement in services. Forward Wald logistic regression suggested that more positive symptoms, having witnessed violence as a child and high agreeableness as a personality trait predicted poor medication adherence. Forward linear regression revealed that physical abuse as a child, lack of knowledge regarding consumer rights, difficulties in building an alliance, low neuroticism and high agreeableness predicted poor service engagement. Profiles of non-adherers or low service engagement were strongly linked to childhood trauma, and high agreeableness, as well as more severe symptoms and poor alliance. Males with histories of legal problems were also more prevalent in both groups. No significant differences were found for insight or substance abuse. Overall, individuals with early psychosis who adhered less to treatment in general could have issues with trusting authority and place more importance on peer acceptance. Results are presented in light of the existing literature and clinical implications are discussed. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Setting: International working group. Methods: The draft of the data set was developed by a working group consisting of members appointed by the Neurourology Committee of the International Continence Society, the European Association of Urology, the American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA), the International Spinal Cord Society (ISCoS) and a representative of the Executive Committee of the International SCI Standards and Data Sets. The final version of the data set was developed after review and comments by members of the Executive Committee of the International SCI Standards and Data Sets, the ISCoS Scientific Committee, ASIA Board, relevant and interested (international) organizations and societies (around 40) and persons and the ISCoS Council. Endorsement of the data set by relevant organizations and societies will be obtained. To make the data set uniform, each variable and each response category within each variable have been specifically defined in a way that is designed to promote the collection and reporting of comparable minimal data. Results: Variables included in the International Urodynamic Basic SCI Data Set are date of data collection, bladder sensation during filling cystometry, detrusor function, compliance during filing cystometry, function during voiding, detrusor leak point pressure, maximum detrusor pressure, cystometric bladder capacity and post-void residual volume.

Contrast masking in strabismic amblyopia: Attenuation, noise, interocular suppression and binocular summation	VISION RESEARCH			English	Article						human vision; amblyopia; strabismus; masking; contrast discrimination; noise	HUMAN VISUAL-SYSTEM; NEUTRAL DENSITY FILTERS; SPATIAL VISION; AREA SUMMATION; NEURAL BASIS; ANISOMETROPIC AMBLYOPIA; DICHOPTIC MASKING; FREQUENCY MASKING; MOTION DETECTION; NATURAL IMAGES	To investigate amblyopic contrast vision at threshold and above we performed pedestal-masking (contrast discrimination) experiments with a group of eight strabismic amblyopes using horizontal sinusoidal gratings (mainly 3 c/deg) in monocular, binocular and dichoptic configurations balanced across eye (i.e. five conditions). With some exceptions in some observers, the four main results were as follows. (1) For the monocular and dichoptic conditions, sensitivity was less in the amblyopic eye than in the good eye at all mask contrasts. (2) Binocular and monocular dipper functions superimposed in the good eye. (3) Monocular masking functions had a normal dipper shape in the good eye, but facilitation vias diminished in the amblyopic eye. (4) A less consistent result was normal facilitation in dichoptic masking when testing the good eye, but a loss of this when testing the amblyopic eye. This pattern of amblyopic results was replicated in a normal observer by placing a neutral density filter in front of one eye. The two-stage model of binocular contrast gain control [Meese, T.S., Georgeson, M.A. & Baker, D.H. (2006). Binocular contrast vision at and above threshold. Journal of Vision 6, 1224-1243.] was 'lesioned' in several ways to assess the form of the amblyopic deficit. The most successful model involves attenuation of signal and an increase in noise in the amblyopic eye, and intact stages of interocular suppression and binocular summation. This implies a behavioural influence from monocular noise in the amblyopic visual system as well as in normal observers with an ND filter over one eye. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

C-fiber spontaneous discharge evoked by chronic inflammation is suppressed by a long-term infusion of lidocaine yielding nanogram per milliliter plasma levels	PAIN			English	Article						allodynia; hyperalgesia; inflammatory pain; lidocaine; muscle	PRIMARY AFFERENT NEURONS; NEUROPATHIC PAIN SCALE; RELIEVES POSTHERPETIC NEURALGIA; QUALITY-OF-LIFE; PATCH 5-PERCENT; INTRAVENOUS LIDOCAINE; SYSTEMIC LIDOCAINE; OPEN-LABEL; A-FIBER; PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHY	Nociceptors innervating inflamed tissue acquire an abnormal spontaneous discharge that is believed to be at least part of the reason for the persistent spontaneous pain, allodynia, and hyperalgesia that accompany inflammation. Recent studies suggest that patients with chronic inflammatory pain may obtain an analgesic effect with transdermal application of lidocaine that yields very low plasma levels (130-225 ng/ml). The aim of this study was to investigate whether a 7-day exposure to such low plasma levels of lidocaine had an effect on inflammation-evoked spontaneous discharge in the rat. Seven days after a hind-paw injection of Complete Freund's Adjuvant (CFA), we confirmed the presence of myositis, pain hypersensitivity, and a significant increase in the incidence of spontaneous discharge in A-fibers and C-fibers innervating both muscle and skin. We then compared the incidence of spontaneous discharge in muscle and cutaneous fibers in CFA-injected animals treated with a 7-day infusion of saline or lidocaine. The lidocaine infusion yielded a plasma level of 210 ng/ml. The muscle C-fiber discharge was completely inhibited by the lidocaine infusion and the cutaneous C-fiber discharge was suppressed by 50%. Lidocaine infusion had no effect on the incidence of spontaneous discharge in muscle or cutaneous A-fibers. Lidocaine infusion reduced mechano-hyperalgesia but had no effect on mechano-allodynia or heat-hyperalgesia. We conclude that the analgesic effects seen clinically with transdermal lidocaine administration yielding low plasma levels may be due to a systemic drug action on spontaneously active C-fibers.

Reactive oxygen species generated by thiol-modifying phenylarsine oxide stimulate the expression of protein L-isoaspartyl methyltransferase	BIOCHEMICAL AND BIOPHYSICAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						protein L-isoaspartyl methyltransferase; phenylarsine oxide; protein oxidation; reactive oxygen species; astroglioma	NADPH OXIDASE; THIOREDOXIN REDUCTASE; HEME OXYGENASE-1; ANTIOXIDANTS; INHIBITION; INDUCTION; DISEASE; STRESS; SYSTEM	Expression of the repair enzyme protein L-isoaspartyl methyltransferase (PIMT) has been reported to play important roles in brain. However, little is known about the regulation of PIMT expression following protein damage by oxidation in brain. Phenylarsine oxide (PAO) is an arsenical compound that alters proteins by forming disulfide bond with vicinal cysteinyl residues. Here we report that PIMT was rapidly up-regulated by PAO in U-87 human astroglioma cells. We also confirmed that PIMT up-regulation by PAO was mediated by the reaction with vicinal cysteines. Furthermore, we showed that PIMT induction by PAO was dependent on formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Crucially, both ROS formation and PIMT induction by PAO were inhibited by antioxidant N-acetyl-L-cysteine and NADPH oxidase inhibitor diphenyleneiodonium chloride. Importantly, down-regulation of PIMT by siRNA strikingly enhanced PAO-induced ROS. Together, these results highlight that PIMT expression is regulated by ROS and could primarily act as an antioxidant enzyme. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Functional contributions of the basal ganglia to emotional prosody: Evidence from ERPs	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						basal ganglia; language; emotion; prosody; ERPs	PARKINSONS-DISEASE; LANGUAGE FUNCTIONS; BRAIN POTENTIALS; RIGHT-HEMISPHERE; SPEECH PROSODY; LATERALIZATION; COMPREHENSION; PERCEPTION; RECOGNITION; ACTIVATION	The basal ganglia (BG) have been functionally linked to emotional processing [Pell, M.D., Leonard, C.L., 2003. Processing emotional tone form speech in Parkinson's Disease: a role for the basal ganglia. Cogn. Affec. Behav. Neurosci. 3, 275-288; Pell, M.D., 2006. Cerebral mechanisms for understanding emotional prosody in speech. Brain Lang. 97 (2), 221-234]. However, few studies have tried to specify the precise role of the BG during emotional prosodic processing. Therefore, the current study examined deviance detection in healthy listeners and patients with left focal BG lesions during implicit emotional prosodic processing in an event-related brain potential (ERP)-experiment. In order to compare these ERP responses with explicit judgments of emotional prosody, the same participants were tested in a follow-up recognition task. As previously reported [Kotz, S.A., Paulmann, S., 2007. When emotional prosody and semantics dance cheek to cheek: ERP evidence. Brain Res. 1151, 107-118; Paulmann, S. & Kotz, S.A., 2008. An ERP investigation on the temporal dynamics of emotional prosody and emotional semantics in pseudo- and lexical sentence context. Brain Lang. 105, 59-69], deviance of prosodic expectancy elicits a right lateralized positive ERP component in healthy listeners. Here we report a similar positive ERP correlate in BG-patients and healthy controls. In contrast, BG-patients are significantly impaired in explicit recognition of emotional prosody when compared to healthy controls. The current data serve as first evidence that focal lesions in left BG do not necessarily affect implicit emotional prosodic processing but evaluative emotional prosodic processes as demonstrated in the recognition task. The results suggest that the BG may not play a mandatory role in implicit emotional prosodic processing. Rather, executive processes underlying the recognition task may be dysfunctional during emotional prosodic processing. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We have previously shown that this upregulation is present from day 4 to day 24, and is not seen late in pregnancy (days 21-22). In the current studies, we demonstrate that bFGF and GFAP are both upregulated in Cg2 as early as 3 h postpartum, and are maintained until at least day 24 postpartum in animals deprived of pup stimulation for 8 days prior to perfusion. bFGF and GFAP immunoreactivity returns to prepartum levels by 5-6 weeks post-weaning, and the typical postpartum increase is not further enhanced in multiparous rats. We also show that, although there are significant changes in levels of bFGF immunoreactivity across the phases of the estrous cycle, peak cycling levels remain much lower than those observed in lactating rats. Possible stimuli involved in the induction of bFGF and GFAP in Cg2, and the potential relevance of these changes to the maternal state are discussed. (C) 2008 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Dcx knockout (KO) mice show no major isocortical abnormalities, but have discrete hippocampal defects. We questioned the functional consequences of these defects and report here that Dcx KO mice are hyperactive and exhibit spontaneous convulsive seizures. Changes in neuropeptide Y and calbindin expression, consistent with seizure occurrence, were detected in a large proportion of KO animals, and convulsants, including kainate and pentylenetetrazole, also induced seizures more readily in KO mice. We show that the dysplastic CA3 region in KO hippocampal slices generates sharp wavelike activities and possesses a lower threshold for epileptiform events. Video-EEG monitoring also demonstrated that spontaneous seizures were initiated in the hippocampus. Similarly, seizures in human patients mutated for DCX can show a primary involvement of the temporal lobe. In conclusion, seizures in Dcx KO mice are likely to be due to abnormal synaptic transmission involving heterotopic cells in the hippocampus and these mice may therefore provide a useful model to further study how lamination defects underlie the genesis of epileptiform activities.

Apoptosis time course in the limbic system after myocardial infarction in the rat	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						limbic structure; myocardial infarction; apoptosis; caspase-3; hippocampus; amygdala	MAJOR DEPRESSION; AMYGDALA; STRESS; BRAIN	Apoptosis is known to occur in the limbic system after myocardial infarction (MI) in the rat. our study was designed to evaluate the time course dynamics of this phenomenon in limbic areas. Apoptosis, i.e., caspase-3 activity and the number of terminal dUTP nick-end labelling-positive cells, as well as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) were quantitated in sham-operated controls and MI rats 1, 2 and 7 days after surgery. Both apoptosis parameters were increased throughout, although in different structures: the CA1 region of the hippocampus and the medial amygdala at day 1, the CA1 region of the hippocampus and the lateral amygdala at day 2, and the frontal cortex at day 7. At day 2, BDNF was decreased in the prefrontal cortex and medial amygdala, whereas it was elevated in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus; at day 7, BDNF was reduced in the frontal cortex and posterior hypothalamus but was augmented in the medial amygdala. These data indicate that post-MI apoptosis in the limbic system is a dynamic process occurring mainly in the hippocampus and amygdala during the first days after MI.

Double-stranded RNA-mediated suppression of period2 expression in the suprachiasmatic nucleus disrupts circadian locomotor activity in rats	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						clock genes; circadian rhythm; oval nucleus of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis; central nucleus of the amygdala; dentate gyrus; RNAi	CLOCK PROTEIN; PHOTIC ENTRAINMENT; STRIA TERMINALIS; GENE-EXPRESSION; OVAL NUCLEUS; BED NUCLEUS; LIMBIC FOREBRAIN; FOS EXPRESSION; RHYTHM; PER2	Circadian behavioral rhythms in mammals are controlled by a central clock located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). PER2, the protein product of the clock gene, Period 2 (Per2), is expressed rhythmically in the SCN [Beaule C, Houle LM, Amir S (2003) Expression profiles of PER2 immunoreactivity within the shell and core regions of the rat suprachiasmatic nucleus: Lack of effect of photic entrainment and disruption by constant light. J Mol Neurosci 21: 133-148] and has been implicated in the control of circadian behavioral rhythms based on the evidence that genetic mutations in Per2 abolish free running locomotor activity rhythms in mice [Zheng B, Larkin DW, Albrecht U, Sun ZS, Sage M, Eichele G, Lee CC, Bradley A (1999) The mPer2 gene encodes a functional component of the mammalian circadian clock. Nature 400:169-173; Bae K, Jin X, Maywood ES, Hastings MH, Reppert SM, Weaver DR (2001) Differential functions of mPer1, mPer2, and mPer3 in the SCN circadian clock. Neuron 30:525-536]. Such mutations eradicate PER2 expression in the SCN and disrupt the SCN molecular clockwork, however, they also affect PER2 in the rest of the brain and body leaving open the possibility that the changes in behavioral rhythms might be influenced, at least in part, by disruptions in PER2 functioning outside the SCN. We used RNA interference-mediated transient knockdown of Per2 to study the effect of selective suppression of PER2 expression in the SCN, per se, on behavioral circadian rhythms. We found that transient suppression of PER2 in the SCN disrupted free running locomotor activity rhythms for up to 10 days in rats. Infusions of control dsRNA into the SCN or infusions of dsRNA to Per2 immediately dorsal to the SCN had no effect. These results constitute evidence for a direct link between PER2 expression in the SCN and the expression of behavioral circadian rhythms in mammals. (C) 2008 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Here, we suggest a mechanism for this form of cotransmission by showing that a subset of DA neurons both in vitro and in vivo expresses vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (VGluT2). Expression of VGluT2 decreases with age. Moreover, when DA neurons are grown in isolation using a microculture system, there is a marked upregulation of VGluT2 expression. We provide evidence that expression of this transporter is normally repressed through a contact-dependent interaction with GABA and other DA neurons, thus providing a partial explanation for the highly restricted expression of VGluT2 in DA neurons in vivo. Our results demonstrate that the neurotransmitter phenotype of DA neurons is both developmentally and dynamically regulated. These findings may have implications for a better understanding of the fast synaptic action of DA neurons as well as basal ganglia circuitry.

Executive function deficits are considered among the most important pathogenic pathways leading to ADHD and may index part of the heterogeneity in this disorder. Methods: To investigate the relationship between the dopamine transporter gene (SLC6A3) 3'-UTR VNTR genotypes and executive function in children with ADHD, 196 children diagnosed with ADHD were sequentially recruited, genotyped, and tested using a battery of three neuropsychological tests aimed at assessing the different aspects of executive functioning. Results: Taking into account a correction for multiple comparisons, the main finding of this study is a significant genotype effect on performances on the Tower of London (F = 6.902, p = 0.009) and on the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, Third Edition (WISC-III) Freedom From Distractibility Index (F = 7.125, p = 0.008), as well as strong trends on Self Ordered Pointing Task error scores (F = 4,996 p = 0.026) and WISC-III Digit Span performance (F = 6.28, p = 0.023). Children with the 9/10 genotype exhibited, on average, a poorer performance on all four measures compared to children with the 10/10 genotype. No effect of genotype on Wisconsin Card Sorting Test measures of performance was detected. Conclusion: Results are compatible with the view that SLC6A3 genotype may modulate components of executive function performance in children with ADHD.

Adverse effects of medical cannabinoids: a systematic review	CANADIAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION JOURNAL			English	Review							CONTROLLED CLINICAL-TRIAL; RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIAL; PLACEBO-CONTROLLED TRIAL; MULTIPLE-SCLEROSIS CAMS; DOUBLE-BLIND; NEUROPATHIC PAIN; ORAL DELTA-9-TETRAHYDROCANNABINOL; CANCER-CHEMOTHERAPY; POSTOPERATIVE PAIN; MEDICINAL EXTRACTS	Background: The therapeutic use of cannabis and cannabis-based medicines raises safety concerns for patients, clinicians, policy-makers, insurers, researchers and regulators. Although the efficacy of cannabinoids is being increasingly demonstrated in randomized controlled trials, most safety information comes from studies of recreational use. Methods: We performed a systematic review of safety studies of medical cannabinoids published over the past 40 years to create an evidence base for cannabis-related adverse events and to facilitate future cannabis research initiatives. We critically evaluated the quality of published studies with a view to identifying ways to improve future studies. Results: A total of 321 articles were eligible for evaluation. After excluding those that focused on recreational cannabis use, we included 31 studies (23 randomized controlled trials and 8 observational studies) of medical cannabis use in our analysis. In the 23 randomized controlled trials, the median duration of cannabinoid exposure was 2 weeks (range 8 hours to 12 months). A total of 4779 adverse events were reported among participants assigned to the intervention. Most (4615 [96.6%]) were not serious. Of the 164 serious adverse events, the most common was relapse of multiple sclerosis (21 events [12.8%]), vomiting (16 events [9.8%]) and urinary tract infection (15 events [9.1%]). The rate of nonserious adverse events was higher among participants assigned to medical cannabinoids than among controls (rate ratio [RR] 1.86, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.57-2.21); the rates of serious adverse events did not differ significantly between these 2 groups (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.78-1.39). Dizziness was the most commonly reported nonserious adverse event (714 events [15.5%]) among people exposed to cannabinoids. Interpretation: Short-term use of existing medical cannabinoids appeared to increase the risk of nonserious adverse events. The risks associated with long-term use were poorly characterized in published clinical trials and observational studies. High-quality trials of long-term exposure are required to further characterize safety issues related to the use of medical cannabinoids.

To address the problem of large delays, it has been proposed that the brain uses an internal forward model of the arm to estimate current and upcoming states of a movement, which are more useful for rapid online control. To study online control mechanisms in the posterior parietal cortex (PPC), we recorded from single neurons while monkeys performed a joystick task. Neurons encoded the static target direction and the dynamic movement angle of the cursor. The dynamic encoding properties of many movement angle neurons reflected a forward estimate of the state of the cursor that is neither directly available from passive sensory feedback nor compatible with outgoing motor commands and is consistent with PPC serving as a forward model for online sensorimotor control. In addition, we found that the space-time tuning functions of these neurons were largely separable in the angle-time plane, suggesting that they mostly encode straight and approximately instantaneous trajectories.

This positron-emission tomography (PET) study tested the hypothesis that 5-HT1A auto receptor internalization might be indexed in vivo by a decrease in the specific binding of the 5-HT1A radioligand, 4-[18F]fluoro-N-[2-[1-(2-methoxyphenyl)-1 piperazinyl]ethyl-N-2-pyridinyl-benzamide ([F-18]MPPF), in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) of healthy adult men administered a single oral dose of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, fluoxetine. Methods: [F-18]MPPF binding potential was measured in the DRN and other brain regions endowed with 5-HT1A receptors in eight healthy volunteers, 5 hours after the randomized, double-blind administration of fluoxetine (20 mg) or placebo. Results: In every subject, [F-18]MPPF binding potential was decreased in the DRN only (44% +/- 22 SD), in response to fluoxetine. Conclusions: Imaging the functional state of 5-HT1A autoreceptors (i.e., internalization) in the human brain, using [F-18]MPPF/PET, may represent a promising avenue for investigating the neurobiology of serotonin-related disorders and notably of major depression.

Preclinical and clinical studies have suggested a role of glutamate in anxiety and depression. This investigation aims at demonstrating fluctuations of glutamate across the menstrual cycle in the medial prefrontal cortex of women who suffer from PMDD and healthy control subjects (HCs). Methods: Twelve PMDD women and 13 HCs were randomized to two single-voxel 3 Tesla proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy examinations of the medial prefrontal cortex during the follicular phase and the luteal phase. Results: A phase effect was observed; the levels of glutamate/creatine plus phosphocreatine (Cr) were significantly lower during the luteal phase compared with the follicular phase. However, no statistically significant diagnosis or phase x diagnosis effects were found. Conclusions: The optimized stimulated echo acquisition mode (STEAM) pulse timings selected in this study (echo time [TE], mixing time [TM] = 240, 27 msec) allow us to interpret our results as the first report of alterations of brain glutamate levels across the menstrual cycle. Hormonal fluctuations associated with the menstrual cycle likely contribute to these glutamate level variations. Although PMDD women undergo a similar decrease in glutamate during the luteal phase as the HCs, PMDD women may display an increased behavioral sensitivity to those phase-related alterations. These menstrual cycle-related variations of glutamate levels may also contribute to the influence of the phases of the menstrual cycle in other neuropsychiatric disorders.

Nerve cells undergo cellular migration during development and also extend neuronal processes for long distances through a complex microenvironment to appropriately wire the nervous system. The growth cone is a highly dynamic structure that responds to extracellular cues by extending and retracting filopodia and lamellipodia to explore the microenvironment and to dictate the path and speed of process extension. Neuronal responses to a myriad of guidance cues have been studied biochemically, however, these approaches fail to capture critical spatio-temporal elements of growth cone dynamics. Live imaging of growth cones in culture has emerged as a powerful tool to study growth cone responses to guidance cues but the dynamic nature of the growth cone requires careful quantitative analysis. Space time kyrnographs have been developed as a tool to quantify lamellipodia dynamics in a semi-automated fashion but no such tools exist to analyze filopodial dynamics. In this work we present an algorithm-to quantify filopodial dynamics from cultured neurons imaged by time-lapse fluorescence microscopy. The method is based on locating the end tips of filopodia and tracking their locations as if they were free-moving particles. The algorithm is a useful tool and should be broadly applicable to filopodial tracking from multiple cell types. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Due to poorly defined underlying mechanisms, current therapies for NeP are far from satisfactory. Mounting evidence suggests that long-term plasticity in pain signaling pathways underpins the pathogenesis of NeP. Inflammatory responses in injured nerves have been recognized as important events initially sensitizing nociceptive neurons and subsequently inducing long-term plasticity in the dorsal root ganglion. Inflammatory cells such as invading macrophages and Schwann cells produce a wide array of inflammatory mediators. Cyclooxygenase 2-dependent prostaglandin E2 (COX2/PGE2) is one of the important mediator abundantly produced in injured nerves and involved in the genesis of NeP. In this mini-review, we highlight possible novel mechanisms underlying the role of COX2/PGE2 in injured nerves in the genesis of NeP. Long lasting COX2/PGE2 in injured nerves may induce chronic effects on nociceptors to facilitate the synthesis of pain-related molecules by stimulating 'en passant' injured or spared axons. CCX2/PGE2 may also induce chronic effects on local inflammatory cells in injured nerves to facilitate the synthesis of inflammatory mediators via autocrine and paracrine pathways. COX2/PGE2 in injured nerves and downstream PGE2 EP receptor signaling should be considered as therapeutic targets to more effectively treat chronic NeP. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Sex-specific pain modulation: The growth factor, neuregulin-1, as a pro-nociceptive cytokine	NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS			English	Article						progesterone; estrogen; growth factor; pain; nociception; cytokine	SPINAL-CORD; FEMALE RATS; LUMBAR RADICULOPATHY; SIGNALING PATHWAYS; NERVOUS-SYSTEM; MESSENGER-RNAS; GLIAL-CELLS; PROGESTERONE; BRAIN; EXPRESSION	An increasing amount of evidence indicates that there are significant sex differences in clinical and experimental pain sensitivity in men and women. While it is now clear that the endogenous sex steroids are involved in mediating these sex differences, the cellular and molecular mechanisms that underlie their effects on nociceptive sensitivity remain elusive. Recent studies have shown that sex steroids are potent regulators of gene expression in glial cells, particularly astrocytes. This review specifically highlights some of the evidence of sex steroid regulation of growth factor expression. Growth factors have been shown to be potent pro-nociceptive mediators in rodents. Thus, regulation of their expression by sex steroids may be a general mechanism by which sex steroids exert their effect on pain sensitivity. One such mechanism, the progesterone specific regulation of the growth factor, neuregulin-1, following nerve root injury in the rat, is described in detail. Neuregulin-1 expression is increased in spinal cord astrocytes only in female rats with circulating progesterone. Neuregulin-1 has also been shown to produce transient tactile allodynia when delivered intrathecally in rats. Our understanding of growth factor regulation by sex steroids promises to open up new avenues of investigation into the mechanisms that drive sex differences in pain sensitivity.

Hypothermia Pediat Head Injury Tri; Canadian Crit Care Trials Grp	Hypothermia therapy after traumatic brain injury in children	NEW ENGLAND JOURNAL OF MEDICINE			English	Article							PEDIATRIC INTENSIVE-CARE; MODERATE HYPOTHERMIA; CARDIAC-ARREST; HEAD-INJURY; TRIAL; ENCEPHALOPATHY; METAANALYSIS; MANAGEMENT; CHILDHOOD; SEVERITY	Background: Hypothermia therapy improves survival and the neurologic outcome in animal models of traumatic brain injury. However, the effect of hypothermia therapy on the neurologic outcome and mortality among children who have severe traumatic brain injury is unknown. Methods: In a multicenter, international trial, we randomly assigned children with severe traumatic brain injury to either hypothermia therapy (32.5 degreesC for 24 hours) initiated within 8 hours after injury or to normothermia (37.0 degreesC). The primary outcome was the proportion of children who had an unfavorable outcome (i.e., severe disability, persistent vegetative state, or death), as assessed on the basis of the Pediatric Cerebral Performance Category score at 6 months. Results: A total of 225 children were randomly assigned to the hypothermia group or the normothermia group; the mean temperatures achieved in the two groups were 33.1+/-1.2 degreesC and 36.9+/-0.5 degreesC, respectively. At 6 months, 31% of the patients in the hypothermia group, as compared with 22% of the patients in the normothermia group, had an unfavorable outcome (relative risk, 1.41; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.89 to 2.22; P=0.14). There were 23 deaths (21%) in the hypothermia group and 14 deaths (12%) in the normothermia group (relative risk, 1.40; 95% CI, 0.90 to 2.27; P=0.06). There was more hypotension (P=0.047) and more vasoactive agents were administered (P<0.001) in the hypothermia group during the rewarming period than in the normothermia group. Lengths of stay in the intensive care unit and in the hospital and other adverse events were similar in the two groups. Conclusions: In children with severe traumatic brain injury, hypothermia therapy that is initiated within 8 hours after injury and continued for 24 hours does not improve the neurologic outcome and may increase mortality.

We previously reported that ablation of RNA-binding protein Sam68 in mice results in male sterility and delayed mammary gland development and protection against osteoporosis in females. Sam68 however is highly expressed in most regions of the brain especially the cerebellum and thus we investigated the cerebellar-related manifestations in Sam68-null mice. We analyzed the mice for motor function, sensory function, and learning and memory abilities. Herein, we report that Sam68-null mice have motor coordination defects as assessed by beam walking and rotorod performance. Forty-week-old Sam68-null mice (n = 12) were compared to their wild-type littermates (n = 12). The Sam68-null mice exhibited more hindpaw faults in beam walking tests and fell from the rotating drum at lower speeds and prematurely compared to the wild-type controls. The Sam68-null mice were, however, normal for forelimb strength, tail-hang reflex, balance test, grid walking, the Morris water task, recognition memory, visual discrimination, auditory stimulation and conditional taste aversion. Our findings support a role for Sam68 in the central nervous system in the regulation of motor coordination. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Compound heterozygosity in sodium channel Nav1.7 in a family with hereditary erythermalgia	MOLECULAR PAIN			English	Article							EXTREME PAIN DISORDER; OF-FUNCTION MUTATION; SCN9A MUTATIONS; ALPHA-SUBUNIT; ERYTHROMELALGIA; NA(V)1.7; GENE; NEURONS	Hereditary erythermalgia is a painful and debilitating genetic disorder associated with mutations in voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.7. We have previously reported a Canadian family segregating erythermalgia consistently with a dominant genetic etiology. Molecular analysis of the proband from the family detected two different missense mutations in Nav1.7. In the present study we have performed a long-term follow-up clinical study of disease progression in three affected family members. A more extensive molecular study has also been completed, analyzing the segregation of the two missense variants in the family. The two variants (P610T, L858F) segregate independently with respect to clinical presentation. Detailed genotype/phenotype correlation suggests that one of the two variants (L858F) is causal for erythermalgia. The second variant (P610T) may modify the phenotype in the proband. This is the second reported study of potential compound heterozygosity for coding polymorphisms in Nav1.7, the first being in a patient with paroxysmal extreme pain disorder.	[Morsche, Rene H.

How accurately does current fetal Imaging identify posterior fossa anomalies?

The first objective of our study was to describe the prevalence and spectrum of posterior fossa anomalies over 5 years in a major fetal care center where the referral diagnosis (by fetal sonography) was investigated by fetal MRI and, if confirmed, by postnatal MRI if possible. The second objective was to assess the accuracy with which fetal MRI predicts postnatal MRI findings in this population. MATERIALS AND METHODs. We retrospectively identified all cases of suspected fetal posterior fossa anomalies referred to our center from 2002 through 2006. We reviewed maternal, fetal, neonatal, and follow-up records of all cases and fetal and early postnatal imaging studies. RESULTs. Of the 90 cases of suspected fetal posterior fossa anomalies (by fetal sonography) referred over the study period, 60 (67%) were confirmed by fetal MRI. Of 42 live-born infants, 39 (93%) underwent postnatal MRI. There was complete agreement in fetal and postnatal MRI diagnoses in 23 infants (59%). In 16 cases (41%), fetal and postnatal MRI diagnoses disagreed; postnatal MRI excluded fetal MRI diagnoses in six cases (15%) and revealed additional anomalies in 10 cases (26%). CONCLUSION. Although a valuable adjunct to fetal sonography in cases of suspected posterior fossa anomaly, current fetal MRI, particularly in early gestation, has limitations in accurately predicting postnatal MRI abnormalities. Advancing the accuracy of MRI for the diagnosis of posterior fossa anomalies will require greater understanding of normal brain development and improved tissue resolution of fetal MRI. During the interim, our findings strongly support the need for postnatal MRI follow-up in cases with suspected posterior fossa anomalies by fetal MRI.

It has efferent connections to brain structures associated with nociception and cardiorespiratory functions. This study aimed at determining the function of the Pa5 on the cardiovascular component of the somatosensory reflex (SSR) to sciatic nerve stimulation (SNS) in paralyzed and artificially-ventilated rats following Pa5 chemical lesions (ibotenic acid), synaptic transmission blockade (CoCl(2)), local anaesthetics (lidocaine) or desensitization of primary afferent fibers (capsaicin). The pressor response to sciatic nerve stimulation at 0.6 mA and 20 Hz (14 +/- 1 mm Hg) was strongly attenuated by contra-(-80%) or bilateral (-50%) paratrigeminal nucleus lesions. Ipsilateral Pa5 lesions only attenuated the response to 0.1 mA, 20 Hz SNS (-55%). Cobalt chloride or lidocaine injected in the contralateral paratrigeminal nucleus also attenuated the SSR. In capsaicin-treated animals, the pressor responses to 0.1 mA were abolished, whereas the responses to SNS at 0.6 mA were increased from 65 to 100% depending on the stimulus frequency. The paratrigeminal nucleus receives both, excitatory and inhibitory components; the later apparently involving capsaicin-sensitive fiber inputs mostly to the ipsilateral site whereas the capsaicin insensitive excitatory components that respond to high or low frequency stimulation, respectively, target the contralateral and ipsilateral sites. Thus, the paratrigeminal nucleus mediates excitatory and inhibitory components of the somatosensory reflex, representing a primary synapse site in the brain for nociceptive inputs from the sciatic innervation field.

Hippocampal lesions in rhesus monkeys disrupt emotional responses but not reinforcer devaluation effects	BIOLOGICAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						devaluation; emotion; fear; hippocampus; monkey; perirhinal cortex; reward; snake	FEAR-POTENTIATED STARTLE; NEUROTOXIC LESIONS; VENTRAL HIPPOCAMPUS; PERIRHINAL CORTEX; MACAQUE MONKEYS; CONTEXTUAL FEAR; PARAHIPPOCAMPAL CORTICES; TEMPORARY INACTIVATION; SELECTIVE LESIONS; AMYGDALA	Background: Although the role of the hippocampus in emotional behavior has long been recognized, the extent to which the hippocampus plays a role in the regulation and expression of emotion in rhesus monkeys has not been systematically explored. Methods: Rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) with excitotoxic lesions of the hippocampal formation and unoperated control animals were assessed on two different types of emotional processing: defensive reactions to a potential predator (experiment 1) and ability to update the value of positive reinforcers, in this case food (experiment 2). Monkeys with aspiration lesions of the perirhinal cortex were also included in this study as an operated control group. Results: In experiment 1, whereas both operated groups showed reduced latencies to retrieve food located near an innately fear-provoking stimulus, a fake snake, only monkeys with hippocampal lesions displayed reduced defensive reactions to the snake. In experiment 2, both operated groups performed as well as control animals when choosing objects flexibly based on the current value of a food. Conclusions: These findings dissociate the hippocampus and perirhinal cortex in fear expression and specifically implicate the hippocampal formation in generating responses to stimuli that are potentially threatening.

Augmented oxidative stress (OS) has been implicated in both neural and peripheral PD tissues. Methods: In this study, Raman scattering and near-infrared spectroscopy were used to detect and quantify oxidative substrate modifications in blood plasma samples from PD and normal elderly control (NEC) subjects. Results: Hypothesis-driven preselection of OS-sensitive bandwidths distinguished PD from NEC subjects with approximately 75% sensitivity and specificity using both complementary spectroscopic techniques. Conclusion: Biospectroscopy of plasma may provide a rapid, minimally invasive and inexpensive chemical biomarker of idiopathic PD.	[Kwok, C.

In other neurological conditions, symptom-specific insight has been noted, with behavioral symptoms appearing especially vulnerable to reduced insight. Different components of insight, self-awareness and self-monitoring, are also often considered separate phenomena. The current study compared insight in patients with PPA, bvFTD, and probable Alzheimer's disease (PrAD) and a group of cognitively intact control subjects. Additionally, differences in insight for the domains primarily affected by the three types of dementia, namely, Behavior, Naming, and Memory, were assessed, and self-awareness and self-monitoring were compared. A total of 55 participants were enrolled. Participants were asked to complete self-estimate scales demonstrating their perceived ability immediately prior to, and immediately following a test in each domain of interest. Results indicated that PPA and normal control groups performed very similarly on control (Weight and Eyesight) and cognitive domains, whereas bvFTD and PrAD patients were unable to accurately assess Memory. All three diagnostic groups failed to accurately assess their behavioral symptoms, suggesting that this domain is vulnerable to loss of insight across diagnoses. Naming ability, in contrast, was either accurately assessed or underestimated in all groups. Finally, there were no notable differences between self-awareness and self-monitoring, potential explanations for this are examined. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Nine different alpha subtypes, designated Nav1.1-Nav1.9 have been identified in excitable cells. Nav1.1, 1.2 and 1.6 are major subtypes in the adult mammalian brain. More than 200 mutations in the Nav1.1 a subtype have been linked to inherited epilepsy syndromes, ranging in seventy from the comparatively mild disorder Generalized Epilepsy with Febrile Seizures Plus to the epileptic encephalopathy Severe Myoclonic Epilepsy of Infancy. Studies using heterologous expression and functional analysis of recombinant Nav1.1 channels suggest that epilepsy mutations in Nav1.1 may cause either gain-of-function or loss-of-function effects that are consistent with either increased or decreased neuronal excitability. How these diverse effects lead to epilepsy is poorly understood. This review summarizes the data on sodium channel mutations and epilepsy and builds a case for the hypothesis that most Nav1.1 mutations have their ultimate epileptogenic effects by reducing Nav1.1-mediated whole cell sodium currents in GABAergic neurons, resulting in widespread loss of brain inhibition, an ideal background for the genesis of epileptic seizures.

However, some animal studies indicate a dose-dependent increase of the potency of neuromuscular blocking drugs by propofol. This study compared mivacurium potency after five minutes and after 20 min of total intravenous anesthesia with propofol (TIVA propofol). Methods: Twenty-eight patients were randomized into two groups, after approval of the Ethics Committee and written consent. Anesthesia was induced, in all patients, using remifentanil 0.5 mu g.kg(-1).min(-1) for two minutes, after which: 3 mg.kg(-1) of propofol was injected; a laryngeal mask airway was inserted; and intermittent, positive pressure ventilation was initiated. Anesthesia was maintained using TIVA propofol (titrated using bispectral index monitoring to 40-45). Neuromuscular monitoring consisted of phonomyography at the adductor pollicis muscle. In Groups 5 min and 20 min, a tetanic stimulation of the ulnar nerve commenced after four minutes and after 19 min of TIVA, respectively, followed by controlled, single twitch stimulation at 1Hz for one minute. Boli of 60, 30, 30, and 30 mu g.kg(-1) mivacurium, respectively, were administered (each drug increment was administered after the effect of the previous dose had caused a stable response), and single twitch stimulation continued at 0.1 Hz. The dose-response curve was determined for both groups; potency was calculated using log-probit analysis. Data were presented as mean (SD) and were compared using two-sided analysis of variance, P < 0.05. Results: Patient characteristics were similar in the two groups. The corresponding ED(50) and ED(95) values were greater, at 76.7 +/- 12.4 mu g.kg(-1) and 146.6 +/- 27.6 mu g.kg(-1) for Group 5 min, vs 46.7 +/- 12.2 mu g.kg(-1) and 101.1 +/- 20.2 mu g.kg(-1) for Group 20 min, respectively. Conclusions: After 20 min of TIVA propofol, the potency of mivacurium is approximately 50% greater than after five minutes of TIVA propofol. For clinical purposes, it is important, therefore, to consider the duration of TIVA propofol before determining the dose of neuromuscular blocking drug.

Our objective was to describe the pattern OF use of educational supports and rehabilitation services in these children at early school age. Methods: Parents of children who participated in a prospective study of developmental progress following open-surgery were contacted to participate in a telephone survey. The questionnaire included questions regarding current educational and rehabilitation resources their child was receiving, as well as the needs perceived by the parents for services, and obstacles to accessing services. Results: The survey was completed by 60 families, the mean age of the children being 8.1 years, with standard deviation of 1.1 years. Of the children, 22% received educational supports, which primarily included supplemental tutoring. Rehabilitation services were received by 2396, speech therapy for 9 children, psychologic support for 6, Occupational therapy for 3, and physical therapy for 1. Children receiving these services were significantly more likely to have had low developmental scores in the expected domains, when compared to those not receiving services. The majority of developmentally delayed children were not receiving adequate, if any, resource support. Medical and surgical history was not associated with greater likelihood of receipt of services. Conclusions: Children with congenitally malformed hearts who are now of school age are at risk for developmental challenges and academic difficulties, yet many do not receive services to optimize performance. Modification of current practice to include systematic, periodic screening, as well as the availability of a resource person for information and referral, may be warranted to meet the ongoing needs of these children and their families, and to optimize their health and well-being.

However, the neural mechanisms that determine how these processes are effectively utilized to guide goal-directed behavior are unknown. Here, we show that rats utilize retrospective and prospective memory and flexible switching between these 2 memory processes to guide behaviors to obtain rewards. We found that retrospective memory is mainly processed in the hippocampus (HPC) but that this retrospective information must be incorporated within the prefrontal cortex (PFC) to be used to switch to an anticipatory response strategy involving prospective memory. Furthermore, switching between memory processes is regulated by the mesocortical dopamine (DA) system. Thus, DA D1 and D2 receptor activation in the PFC differentially affects retrospective memory processing within the HPC via an indirect feedback pathway. In contrast, D1, but not D2, receptor activation is crucial for incorporation of HPC-based retrospective information into the PFC. However, once this takes place, D2 receptor activation is required for further processing of information to effect preparation of future actions. These results provide a unique perspective on the mechanism of memory-based goal-directed behavior.

To date, this has not been demonstrated for olfactory stimuli. By means of positron emission tomography, we sought to elucidate the neuronal substrates behind body odor perception to answer the question of whether the central processing of body odors differs from perceptually similar nonbody odors. Body odors were processed by a network that was distinctly separate from common odors, indicating a separation in the processing of odors based on their source. Smelling a friend's body odor activated regions previously seen for familiar stimuli, whereas smelling a stranger activated amygdala and insular regions akin to what has previously been demonstrated for fearful stimuli. The results provide evidence that social olfactory stimuli of high ecological relevance are processed by specialized neuronal networks similar to what has previously been demonstrated for auditory and visual stimuli.

The prevalence of CNS manifestations ranges between 17 and 75%, reflecting different methods of patient selection and assessment, varying levels of assessor expertise, and lack of a consensus for diagnosing active and chronic neuropsychiatric (NP) manifestations. Postulated pathogenic mechanisms of peripheral and CNS events include vasculopathy, autoantibody effects, and systemic inflammation. Diagnosis is often difficult because of the lack of standardized diagnostic techniques. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is considered the gold standard for the evaluation of CNS manifestations in SLE patients in clinical practice. MRI findings are diverse, and atrophy and hyperintense white matter lesions often correlate poorly with clinical manifestations, occurring also in patients without marked CNS signs and symptoms. We will describe MRI findings in SLE patients and discuss the usefulness of different MRI techniques in evaluating acute and chronic CNS manifestations.

In Experiment 1, the musical clips were rated in terms of how clearly the intended emotion was portrayed, and for valence and arousal. In Experiment 2, a gating paradigm was used to evaluate the course for emotion recognition. In Experiment 3, a dissimilarity judgement task and multidimensional scaling analysis were used to probe emotional content with no emotional labels. The results showed that emotions are easily recognised and discriminated on the basis of valence and arousal and with relative immediacy. Happy and sad excerpts were identified after the presentation of fewer than three musical events.

Age-dependent cognitive changes in carriers of the fragile X syndrome	CORTEX			English	Article						fragile X syndrome; fragile X permutation; fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS); cognition; attention	CEREBELLAR TREMOR/ATAXIA SYNDROME; POSITRON-EMISSION TOMOGRAPHY; FMR1 MESSENGER-RNA; PREMUTATION CARRIERS; DIFFERENTIAL IMPACT; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; MENTAL-RETARDATION; STATUS CATEGORIES; ELEVATED LEVELS; WORKING-MEMORY	Fragile X syndrome is a neurodevelopmental disorder that is caused by the silencing of a single gene on the X chromosome, the fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene. Affected individuals display a unique neurocognitive phenotype that includes significant impairment in inhibitory control, selective attention, working memory, and visual-spatial cognition. In contrast, little is known about the trajectory and specificity of any cognitive impairment associated with the fragile X premutation (i.e., "carrier status") or its relationship with the recently identified neurodegenerative disorder, fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS). In the present study, we evaluated a broad sample of 40 premutation males (PM) aged 18-69 years matched on age and IQ to 67 unaffected comparison males (NC). Performance was compared across a range of cognitive domains known to be impaired in fragile X syndrome (i.e., "full mutation"). Tremor was also assessed using a self-report neurological questionnaire. PM displayed statistically significant deficits in their ability to inhibit prepotent responses, differentiating them from NC from age 30 onwards. With increasing age, the two groups follow different trajectories, with PM developing progressively more severe problems in inhibitory control. This deficit also has a strong co-occurrence in males displaying FXTAS-related symptomatology (p < .001). Selective attention was also impaired in PM but did not show any disproportionate aging effect. No other cognitive deficits were observed. We conclude that an inhibitory deficit and its impact across the lifespan are specifically associated with the fragile X premutation status, and may be a precursor for development of a more severe form of cognitive impairment or dementia, which has been reported in patients with the diagnosis of FXTAS.

Recent findings Recent advances in our understanding of the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis, particularly as it relates to the development of chronic disability, have led away from a 'lesion-centric' view of multiple sclerosis towards investigating neurodegeneration and pathology in normal appearing brain tissue. Advanced image processing techniques that measure atrophy globally and regionally also have provided insight into the putative mechanisms that contribute to neurodegeneration. In addition, novel quantitative imaging techniques that are more specific than conventional MRI for myelin and axonal pathology have been instrumental in revealing the dynamic nature of injury and repair of myelin and axons in lesions. Novel imaging techniques that are sensitive to the pathology of myelin and axons that happens in multiple sclerosis also provide a method by which we can measure neuroprotection and test the efficacy of putative therapeutic agents in multiple sclerosis. Summary Non-conventional MRI techniques have contributed to a greater understanding of the complex pathogenesis of neurodegenerative phenomena that occur in multiple sclerosis. The pathological specificity of these novel imaging methods enables the evaluation of the neuroprotective effects of novel therapeutic strategies.

Several authors have tried to find a hemispheric specialization for ictal fear, but have not reached the power to attain a statistically significant effect of focus side. In this study, using previously published cases of unilateral epileptic focus causing early ictal symptoms of fear, we found 144 cases, of which 98 had a right hemisphere focus (68%) and 46 having left hemisphere focus (32%, p < 0.0005).

Methods: Sixteen men with variable drinking histories were characterized on their ethanol-induced cardiac response, a marker previously proposed to index dopamine system reactivity and vulnerability to alcohol abuse. During separate sessions participants were administered (i) a nutritionally balanced (BAL) amino acid (AA) mixture, (ii) a mixture lacking the dopamine precursors, phenylalanine and tyrosine, and (iii) APTD followed by the dopamine precursor, L-DOPA. Five hours after AA administration, participants could earn units of alcohol using a progressive ratio breakpoint task. Results: Alcohol self-administration was reduced in the APTD and APTD+L-DOPA conditions relative to the BAL condition. In both cases the changes were predicted by ethanol-induced cardiac change. Conclusions: The motivation to drink is likely regulated by more than one neurobiological mechanism. Individual differences in cardiac responsivity to ethanol might provide a peripheral marker of responsiveness to pharmacological manipulations of dopamine. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. and ECNP.

We hypothesized that this process is initiated as soon as an instructional cue to retrieve a particular aspect of an encoded stimulus is presented prior to the appearance of the test stimulus that prompts the subjects' response. To test this hypothesis, we provided the subjects with a delay period following the presentation of the instructional cue. Across delays, the subjects took longer to respond during the active retrieval compared with the automatic retrieval trials. Importantly, for both trial types, delays of up to 300 ms improved the subjects' reaction times during the test period by an average of 101 ms. Retrieval mechanisms, therefore, are initiated early during the post-instruction delay period prior to the presentation of the test stimulus needed for the decision.

Adaptation changes the spatial frequency tuning of adult cat visual cortex neurons	EXPERIMENTAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						visual cortex; short term plasticity; spatial frequency tuning; vision	CONTRAST ADAPTATION; STRIATE CORTEX; COMPLEX CELLS; SINGLE UNITS; ORIENTATION; MACAQUE; PLASTICITY; MOTION; MAPS; AREA	The modular layout of striate cortex is arguably a hallmark of all cortical organization. Neurons of a given module or domain respond optimally to very few specific properties, such as orientation or direction. However, it is possible, under appropriate conditions, to compel a neuron to respond preferentially to a different optimal property. In anesthetized cats, prepared for electrophysiological recordings in the visual cortex, we applied a spatial frequency (SF) that differs (by 0.25-3.0 octaves) from the optimal one for 7-13 min without interruption. This application shifted the tuning curve of the cell mainly in the direction of the imposed SF. Indeed, results indicate an attractive push occurring more frequently (50%) than a repulsive (30%) shift in cortical cells. The increase of responsivity is band-limited and is around the imposed SF, while flanked responses remained unmodified in all conditions. We hypothesize that the observed reversible plasticity is obtained by a modulation of the balance between the strengths of the respective synaptic inputs. These changes in preferred original optimal spatial frequencies may allow a dynamic reaction of cortex to a new environment and particularly to "zoom'' cellular activity toward persistent stimuli in spite of the tuning inherited from genetic programming of response properties and environmental conditions during critical periods in new born animals.

Their navigation is largely directed by guidance cues present in their environment. Since cAMP is an important second messenger that mediates the neural response to guidance molecules and its intracellular levels seem to decrease significantly following birth, we tested whether modulation of the cAMP/protein kinase A (PKA) pathway would affect the normal development of RGC axons. At postnatal day 1, hamsters received a unilateral intraocular injection of either 0.9% saline solution, 12 mM of the membrane-permeable cAMP analogue (dibutyryl cAMP; db-cAMP), or 10 mu M of the PKA inhibitor KT5720. Intraocular elevation of cAMP significantly accelerated RGC axonal growth while inhibition of PKA activity decreased it. Moreover, when highly purified RGC cultures were treated with forskolin (an activator of adenylate cyclase) or cAMP analogues (db-cAMP and Sp-cAMP), neurite length, growth cone (GC) surface area and GC filopodia number were significantly increased. This indicates that intraocular elevation of cAMP acts directly on RGCs. Since these effects were prevented by PKA inhibitors, it demonstrates that cAMP also exerts its action via the PKA pathway. Taken together, these results suggest that the cAMP/PKA cascade is essential for the normal development of retinothalamic projections. Crown Copyright (c) 2008 Published by Elsevier Inc.

To avoid residual paralysis after anaesthesia, reversal of blockade is commonly accomplished with anticholinesterase agents but these drugs have cardiovascular side effects and incomplete effectiveness. Sugammadex is a cyclodextrin that binds rocuronium and chemically similar neuromuscular blocking drugs. Objective: Published data on the effectiveness of sugammadex as a reversal agent were examined. Methods: Peer-reviewed articles on residual postoperative paralysis and sugammadex (ORG 25969) were analysed. Results: Rocuronium-sugammadex complexes are formed and excreted via the kidney. The dissociation constant of the reaction is estimated at 0.1 mu M. Sugammadex produces more rapid reversal of rocuronium- and vecuronium-induced blockade than current reversal agents. The dose required depends directly on intensity of blockade. To date, there appear to be few side effects. Inadequate dosage may lead to reparalysis. Conclusion: More data are needed, especially in patients with renal failure and those who require neuromuscular blockade again soon after receiving sugammadex.

Although selenoproteins are thought to be instrumental for the effects of selenium, the biological function of many of these proteins remains unknown. Here, we studied the role of selenoprotein T (SelT), a selenocysteine (Sec)-containing protein with no known function, which we have identified as a novel target gene of the neuropeptide pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) during PC12 cell differentiation. SelT was found to be ubiquitously expressed throughout embryonic development and in adulthood in rat. Immunocytochemical analysis revealed that SelT is mainly localized to the endoplasmic reticulum through a hydrophobic domain. PACAP and cAMP induced a rapid and long-lasting increase in SelT gene expression in PC12 cells, in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner. These results suggested a possible role of SelT in PACAP signaling during PC12 cell differentiation. Indeed, overexpression of SelT in PC12 cells provoked an increase in the concentration of intracellular Ca(2+) ([Ca(2+)](i)) that was dependent on the Sec residue. Conversely, SelT gene knockdown inhibited the PACAP-induced increase in [Ca(2+)] i and reduced hormone secretion. These findings demonstrate the implication of a selenoprotein in the regulation of Ca(2+) homeostasis and neuroendocrine secretion in response to a cAMP-stimulating trophic factor.

Design: Literature search L, sing the keywords birth defect, congenital malformation, clomiphene, aromatase inhibitor, letrozole, gonadotropin, metformin, gonadotropin releasing hormone agonist and antagonist, progesterone, progestin, and estrogen. We conducted the search in Medline, EMBASE, and Cochrane Database of systematic reviews. Result(s): The available data suggest that clomiphene treatment, especially after several cycles, might be associated with a slightly higher risk of neural tube defects and severe hypospadias in the offspring. Letrozole and metformin do not appear to be teratogenic. The existing data concerning gonadotropin preparations suggest that there is no evidence of teratogenicity, yet, information after 1991 is lacking. Micronized progesterone, which is widely used in in vitro fertilization treatment, does not appear to increase the, risk of nongenital birth defects; however, there might be a possible weak association between other progestational agents and hypospadias. Conclusion(s): Infertility per se is a risk factor for congenital anomalies Repeated clomiphene treatment might be associated with a slightly higher risk of hypospadias and neural tube defect. However, the overall increased risk related to various fertility drugs is only 1% to 2%. (Fertil Steril (R) 2008;89:1595-602. (c) 2008 by American Society for Reproductive Medicine.).

Brain response to visual sexual stimuli in heterosexual and homosexual males	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING			English	Article						sexual arousal; sexual orientation; functional magnetic resonance imaging	FUNCTIONAL MAGNETIC-RESONANCE; ERECTILE DYSFUNCTION; HUMAN AMYGDALA; HEALTHY-MEN; AROUSAL; ACTIVATION; DISGUST; CORTEX; ORIENTATION; AREAS	Although heterosexual and homosexual individuals clearly show differences in subjective response to heterosexual and homosexual sexual stimuli, the neurobiological processes underlying sexual orientation are largely unknown. We addressed the question whether the expected differences in subjective response to visual heterosexual and homosexual stimuli may be reflected in differences in brain activation pattern. Twenty-four healthy male volunteers, 12 heterosexuals and 12 homosexuals, were included in the study. BOLD signal was measured while subjects were viewing erotic videos of heterosexual and homosexual content. SPM02 was used for data analysis. Individual sexual arousal was assessed by subjective rating. As compared to viewing sexually neutral videos, viewing erotic videos led to a brain activation pattern characteristic for sexual arousal in both groups only when subjects were viewing videos of their respective sexual orientation. Particularly, activation in the hypothalamus, a key brain area in sexual function, was correlated with sexual arousal. Conversely, when viewing videos opposite to their sexual orientation both groups showed absent hypothalamic activation. Moreover, the activation pattern found in both groups suggests that stimuli of opposite sexual orientation triggered intense autonomic response and may be perceived, at least to some extent, as aversive.

Occupational ototoxicity of n-hexane	HUMAN & EXPERIMENTAL TOXICOLOGY			English	Article						interactions; n-hexane; noise; ototoxicity; work environments	METHYLATED BENZENE-DERIVATIVES; AUDITORY-EVOKED-POTENTIALS; TERM COMBINED EXPOSURE; PERIPHERAL-NERVE; VISUAL SYSTEMS; RATS; BRAIN; TOLUENE; POLYNEUROPATHY; RESPONSES	The ability of chemicals to produce hearing loss themselves or to promote noise-induced hearing loss has been reported for some organic solvents. The objective of this study was to review the literature on the effects of low-level exposure to n-hexane on the auditory system and consider its relevance for occupational settings. Both human and animal investigations were evaluated only for realistic exposure concentrations based on the permissible inhalation exposure limits. In Quebec, the time-weighted average exposure value (TWAEV) for 8 h is 50 ppm. In humans, the upper limit for considering ototoxicity data relevant to the occupational exposure situation was set at five times the TWAEV. Animal data were evaluated only for exposure concentrations up to 100 times the TWAEV. There is no convincing evidence of n-hexane-induced hearing loss in workers. In rats, n-hexane seems to affect auditory function; however, the site of these alterations cannot be determined from the present data. Further studies with sufficient data on the exposure of workers to n-hexane are necessary to make a definitive conclusion. In the interim, we recommend considering n-hexane as a possibly ototoxic agent.

Mice deficient in Neu4 sialidase exhibit abnormal ganglioside catabolism and lysosomal storage	HUMAN MOLECULAR GENETICS			English	Article							HUMAN NEUROBLASTOMA-CELLS; HUMAN PLACENTAL SIALIDASE; TAY-SACHS-DISEASE; PLASMA-MEMBRANE; CYTOSOLIC SIALIDASE; SANDHOFF DISEASES; ACTIVATOR PROTEIN; GM1 GANGLIOSIDE; MOUSE MODELS; DIFFERENTIATION	Mammalian sialidase Neu4, ubiquitously expressed in human tissues, is located in the lysosomal and mitochondrial lumen and has broad substrate specificity against sialylated glycoconjugates. To investigate whether Neu4 is involved in ganglioside catabolism, we transfected beta-hexosaminidase-deficient neuroglia cells from a Tay-Sachs patient with a Neu4-expressing plasmid and demonstrated the correction of storage due to the clearance of accumulated GM2 ganglioside. To further clarify the biological role of Neu4, we have generated a stable loss-of-function phenotype in cultured HeLa cells and in mice with targeted disruption of the Neu4 gene. The silenced HeLa cells showed reduced activity against gangliosides and had large heterogeneous lysosomes containing lamellar structures. Neu4(-/-) mice were viable, fertile and lacked gross morphological abnormalities, but showed a marked vacuolization and lysosomal storage in lung and spleen cells. Lysosomal storage bodies were also present in cultured macrophages preloaded with gangliosides. Thin-layer chromatography showed increased relative level of GD1a ganglioside and a markedly decreased level of GM1 ganglioside in brain of Neu4(-/-) mice suggesting that Neu4 may be important for desialylation of brain gangliosides and consistent with the in situ hybridization data. Increased levels of cholesterol, ceramide and polyunsaturated fatty acids were also detected in the lungs and spleen of Neu4(-/-) mice by high-resolution NMR spectroscopy. Together, our data suggest that Neu4 is a functional component of the ganglioside-metabolizing system, contributing to the postnatal development of the brain and other vital organs.

We propose a unified framework based on evolutionary psychology and supported by recent findings,in cognitive neuroscience for understanding sex differences in cognition and how they relate to online navigation and website preferences. The literature on sex differences in navigation, object location, spatial rotation, the perception of color, form, and movement, and verbal fluency is reviewed within the context of their evolutionary underpinnings. Based on these findings, specific website design recommendations are proposed. Results of a pilot study examining sex differences in web navigation provide evidence that utilizing an evolutionary approach can engender findings with significant implications for e-communication researchers and practitioners alike.

A computer-based classifier of three-dimensional spinal scoliosis severity	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER ASSISTED RADIOLOGY AND SURGERY			English	Article						Scoliosis severity; Kohonen neural network; Classification; 3D spine description		Objective This article describes a computer-based method for the classification of spine scoliosis severity. This is a first step toward an effective computerized tool to assist general practitioners diagnose spine scoliosis. The method progresses away from Cobb angles toward pattern and magnitude categorization based upon 3D configurations. Materials and methods The purpose is to classify spine shapes reconstructed from a pair of calibrated X-ray images into one of three categories, namely, normal spine, moderate scoliosis, and severe scoliosis. The spine shape is represented by the three-dimensional coordinates of a sequence of equidistant points sampled by interpolation on the reconstructed spine shape. Classification is carried out using a self-organizing Kohonen neural network trained using this representation. Results The tests were performed using a database of 174 spine biplane X-rays. The classification accuracy was 97%. Conclusion The results demonstrate that classification of 3D spine descriptions by a Kohonen neural network affords a solid basis for an effective tool to assist clinicians in assessing scoliosis severity.

We focused more specifically on the influence of SA4503 on central serotonergic (5-HT) transmission, and on hippocampal cell proliferation. A 2-d continuous treatment with SA 4503 (1-40 mg/kg. d) increased 5-HT neuron firing rate in a dose-dependent, bell-shaped manner, with a culminating effect of +90% at 10 mg/kg.d. The same dose induced the appearance of a 5-HT1A receptor-mediated inhibitory tonus on hippocampal pyramidal neurons, as revealed by intravenous injections of the selective 5-HT1A antagonist WAY 100635. Moreover, continuous administration of SA 4503 (3 and 10 mg/kg. d, 3 d) dose-dependently enhanced the number of bromodeoxyuridine-positive cells in the subgranular zone of the hippocampus (+48% and +94%, respectively), thus indicating an increased cell proliferation. Finally, a single administration of SA 4503 (3 and 10 mg/kg i.p.) increased the time spent swimming in the forced swimming test. Together, these results provide both functional and behavioural evidence that this compound has an important antidepressant potential. Further, the fact that the functional changes occurred within a short time-frame (2-3 d) suggest that this antidepressant potential might have a rapid onset of action.

ICONE: An International Consortium of Neuro Endovascular Centres	INTERVENTIONAL NEURORADIOLOGY			English	Article							UNRUPTURED INTRACRANIAL ANEURYSMS; RANDOMIZED-TRIAL; CLINICAL-TRIALS; SAFETY; EFFICACY; DEVICES	The proliferation of new endovascular devices and therapeutic strategies calls for a prudent and rational evaluation of their clinical benefit. This evaluation must be done in an effective manner and in collaboration with industry. Such research initiative requires organisational and methodological support to survive and thrive in a competitive environment. We propose the formation of an international consortium, an academic alliance committed to the pursuit of effective neurovascular therapies. Such a consortium would be dedicated to the design and execution of basic science, device development and clinical trials. The Consortium is owned and operated by its members. Members are international leaders in neurointerventional research and clinical practice. The Consortium brings competency, knowledge, and expertise to industry as well as to its membership across a spectrum of research initiatives such as: expedited review of clinical trials, protocol development, surveys and systematic reviews; laboratory expertise and support for research design and grant applications to public agencies. Once objectives and protocols are approved, the Consortium provides a stable network of centers capable of timely realization of clinical trials or preclinical investigations in an optimal environment. The Consortium is a non-profit organization. The potential revenue generated from client-sponsored financial agreements will be re-directed to the academic and research objectives of the organization. The Consortium wishes to work in concert with industry, to support emerging trends in neurovascular therapeutic development. The Consortium is a realistic endeavour optimally structured to promote excellence through scientific appraisal of our treatments, and to accelerate technical progress while maximizing patients' safety and welfare.

Robin			Signs of life and signs of death: brain death and other mixed messages at the end of life	JOURNAL OF CHILD HEALTH CARE			English	Article						bereavement; brain death; end-of-life care; organ donation; parental perception		Brain death is a medical, legal and cultural category constructed to fill an important need created by evolving medical technologies and practices. However, managing life and death via organ transplants and brain death criteria is not without controversy; there remains much confusion and ambivalence in both lay and medical populations regarding both organ donation and the diagnostic category of brain death. By way of a case study of cranial trauma taken from a larger study of bereaved parents, this article discusses how, from a parent's perspective, brain death and organ donation are neither morally nor medically straightforward concepts. The case study presented in this article demonstrates the necessity for more research and clinical training in communication issues regarding brain death and end-of-life care with families in critical care situations.

Those studies covered a restricted age range in pediatric populations only and did not control for important moderator variables. The present investigation studied IQ change in brain-lesioned children and adults (age 0 to 84 years). Altogether, 72 5 cases with a documented unilateral focal lesion were gathered from hospital charts and from published cases in the literature, including 240 with repeated IQ testing. Multiple regression analyses isolated the contribution of age at lesion onset to IQ change. Important mediator variables included were lesion side, site, volume, etiology, and so on. An early lesion was significantly associated with poorer postlesion IQ in time and with decline of IQ in time. Later onset lesions were associated with better postlesion IQ and recovery in time. The so-called Kennard principle is refuted, with regard to IQ.	[Braun, Claude M.

Recent advances in neuroimaging, statistics and information management provide powerful tools to support neuropsychoiogical research. At the same time, changing ethical requirements and privacy concerns impose increasingly high standards on the procedures used to recruit research participants, and on subsequent data management. Shared, centrally managed research registries provide a framework for facilitating access to this method for nonclinicians, addressing ethical concerns, streamlining recruitment and screening procedures, and coordinating subsequent research contacts and data storage. We report the experience of two such registries: the patient database of the Center for Cognitive Neuroscience at the University of Pennsylvania, and the Cognitive Neuroscience Research Registry at McGill University.

Transverse sections of the L4-L5 segments were processed for triple labeling with isolectin B4 (IB4)-binding as a marker of nonpeptidergic C-fibers, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) immunoreactivity to label peptidergic nociceptive afferents, and a fluorescent Nissl stain to visualize cells and lamination at different stages of postnatal development. The Nissl staining revealed that the thickness of lamina I (LI) and outer lamina II remained mostly unchanged from birth until adulthood. CGRP afferents terminated mostly in LI and the outer two-thirds of lamina II, whereas the termination area of fibers binding IB34 was centered on the middle one-third of lamina II at all ages studied. In absolute values, the overall width of the bands of intense CGRP and IB4 labeling increased with age but decreased as a percentage of the overall thickness of the dorsal horn with maturation. The overlap of CGRP termination area with that of IB4 afferents increased with age. The consequences of these findings are twofold. First, the size of the different laminae does not grow evenly across the dorsal horn. Second, CGRP and IB4 labeling cannot be considered per se to be reliable markers of lamination during development. These findings have implications for comparing data obtained in immature and mature tissues with respect to localization of structures in the dorsal horn.

This study compared caregiver reported neuropsychiatric symptoms in these 2 forms of dementia at short and long disease duration. Patients with behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia had more symptoms than patients with primary progressive aphasia. However, when divided by duration of disease, patients with primary progressive aphasia with long duration had a similar number of symptoms to patients with behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia at either duration. Furthermore, this group of patients with primary progressive aphasia had more symptoms typical of behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia and less mood-related symptoms which were more common in patients with primary progressive aphasia with shorter duration. This study illustrates the emergence of neuropsychiatric symptoms as primary progressive aphasia progresses and highlights the increasing overlap with behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia because the disease affects areas outside of the language network.

Mefolinate (5-methyltetrahydrofolate), but not folic acid, decreases mortality in an animal model of severe methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase deficiency	JOURNAL OF INHERITED METABOLIC DISEASE			English	Article							MICROBIOLOGICAL ASSAY; FOLATE CONCENTRATIONS; LACTOBACILLUS-CASEI; CHILDBEARING AGE; HOMOCYSTEINE; HYPERHOMOCYSTEINEMIA; METHIONINE; PREGNANCY; OUTCOMES; WOMEN	Severe deficiency of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) results in homocystinuria, with a variety of neurological and vascular complications, and sometimes death in the first year of life. MTHFR (EC 1.5.1.20) catalyses the synthesis of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-methylTHF) which is required for homocysteine remethylation to methionine. Mthfr(-/-) mice are a good animal model of severe MTHFR deficiency in humans. They have marked hyperhomocysteinaemia and a high rate of mortality in the neonatal period. We attempted to rescue Mthfr(-/-) mice from postnatal death by treating their Mthfr(+/-) mothers with mefolinate (a synthetic form of 5-methylTHF, dissolved in their drinking water) or with a folic acid-enriched diet throughout pregnancy and lactation. We monitored pups' vitality and body weights until 3 weeks of age. The majority of Mthfr(-/-) pups from the control groups died during the first week of life. Body weights of -/- pups from control groups were significantly less than those of their Mthfr(+/-)supercript stop and Mthfr(+/+) littermates. Mefolinate treatment significantly improved survival rates (64% survival) in the -/- pups and improved morphology of the cerebellum. Folic acid supplementation did not affect the survival rate or body weights of the -/- pups. Our study suggests that MTHFR is important for postnatal growth and vitality, and that 5-methylTHF deficiency contributes to the high postnatal mortality. Mefolinate may be a good candidate drug for treatment of severe MTHFR deficiency.

The disorder is caused by the silencing of a single gene on the X chromosome, the Fragile X Mental Retardation Gene-I. A substantial body of research across the disciplines of molecular genetics, child psychiatry and developmental neuroscience bears testament to a decade of exciting and innovative science that has advanced our knowledge about the fragile X 'signature' or influence across cognitive and social development. The core aims of this review are to first discuss fragile X syndrome and premutation involvement in the context of current advances that demonstrate the dynamic nature of the genotype on phenotypic outcomes. Second, to discuss the implications of these recent advances for the development of clinical and educational interventions and resource tools that target specific phenotypic 'signatures' within the fragile X continuum.

Agonists of liver-X- receptors (LXRs) stimulate several genes that regulate cholesterol homeostasis, and synthetic LXR agonists decrease neuropathological and cognitive phenotypes in AD mouse models. The cholesterol transporter ABCG1 is LXR-responsive and highly expressed in brain. In vitro, conflicting reports exist as to whether ABCG1 promotes or impedes Ab production. To clarify the in vivo roles of ABCG1 in Ab metabolism and brain cholesterol homeostasis, we assessed neuropathological and cognitive outcome measures in PDAPP mice expressing excess transgenic ABCG1. A 6-fold increase in ABCG1 levels did not alter Ab, amyloid, apolipoprotein E levels, cholesterol efflux, or cognitive performance in PDAPP mice. Furthermore, endogenous murine Ab levels were unchanged in both ABCG1-overexpressing or ABCG1-deficient mice. These data argue against a direct role for ABCG1 in AD. However, excess ABCG1 is associated with decreased levels of sterol precursors and increased levels of SREBP-2 and HMG-CoA-reductase mRNA, whereas deficiency of ABCG1 leads to the opposite effects. Although functions for ABCG1 in cholesterol efflux and Ab metabolism have been proposed based on results with cellular model systems, the in vivo role of this enigmatic transporter may be largely one of regulating the sterol biosynthetic pathway.

Accordingly, the primary aim of neuroprotective strategies has been to preserve RGC axons and soma. RGCs are complex and highly polarized central neurons, and their pathologic response in disease is likely to be an integration of signals from all cellular compartments-axons, soma, dendrites, and synaptic contacts. We focus on the role of dendrites and dendritic spines in normal neuronal function, neurologic disorders, and glaucoma. The need to understand the mechanisms underlying RGC dendrite and synapse degeneration in glaucoma and other optic neuropathies is compelling, as it may provide insight into novel therapeutic strategies to prevent vision loss.

Our previous studies demonstrated early reduction of proteasome-mediated proteolytic activity in lumbar spinal cord of SOD1(G93A) transgenic mice, tissue particularly vulnerable to disease. The purpose of this study was to identify any underlying abnormalities in proteasomal structure. In lumbar spinal cord of pre-symptomatic mice [postnatal day 45 (P45) and P75], normal levels of structural 20S alpha subunits were incorporated into 20S/26S proteasomes; however, proteasomal complexes separated by native gel electrophoresis showed decreased immunoreactivity with antibodies to beta 3, a structural subunit of the 20S proteasome core, and beta 5, the subunit with chymotrypsin-like activity. This occurred prior to increase in beta 5i immunoproteasomal subunit. mRNA levels were maintained and no association of mutant SOD1 with proteasomes was identified, implicating post-transcriptional mechanisms. mRNAs also were maintained in laser captured motor neurons at a later stage of disease (P100) in which multiple 20S proteins are reduced relative to the surrounding neuropil.

In some species, this variation is associated with maternal effects in which variation in maternal investment results in stable individual differences in reproductive function. Recent studies with the rat suggest that maternal effects can alter the function of neuroendocrine systems associated with female sexual behaviour as well as maternal behaviour. These maternal effects appear to be mediated by epigenetic modifications at the promoter for oestrogen receptor alpha (ER alpha) and subsequent effects on gene expression. The tissue-specific nature of such effects may underlie the co-ordinated variation in multiple forms of reproductive function, resulting in distinct reproductive strategies.	[Cameron, N. M.; Dhir, S.

Here, we show that innate immune cells (i.e. natural killer [NK] and gamma delta T cells) cause loss of neurons from primary human neuron-enriched cultures by destroying the supporting astrocytes. Interleukin 2-activated NK cells caused loss of astrocytes within I hour, whereas neurons were lost at 4 hours. Time-lapse imaging indicated that delayed neuron loss was due to early destruction of supporting astrocytes. Selective blocking of astrocyte death with anti-NKG2D antibodies reduced neuron loss, as did blocking of CD54 on astrocytes. gamma delta T cells also induced astrocyte cytotoxicity, leading to subsequent neuronal displacement. In astrocytes, NK cells caused caspase-dependent fragmentation of the intermediate filament proteins glial fibrillary acidic protein and vimentin, whereas anti-CD3-activated T cells produced fragmentation to a lesser extent and without measurable cytotoxicity. Glial fibrillary acidic protein fragmentation was also demonstrated in lysates from chronic multiple sclerosis plaques but not from normal control white matter. These data suggest that non-major histocompatibility complex-restricted immune effector cells may contribute to neuron loss in neuroinflammatory disorders indirectly through injury of glia.

Use of hinged rods for controlled osteoclastic correction of a fixed cervical kyphotic deformity in ankylosing spondylitis	JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGERY-SPINE			English	Article						ankylosing spondylitis; cervical deformity; instrumentation; kyphosis; spinal deformity; trauma	SPINE; OSTEOTOMY; EXPERIENCE	Cervical kyphosis in patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) can be severely disabling. Surgical treatment of this disorder is technically demanding, however, with a considerable risk of neurological and vascular injuries. The extension osteotomy is a well-described posterior treatment for this condition, but this approach presents the risk of acute subluxation and spinal column translation during the reduction. In this paper, the authors report the novel use of a hinged posterior cervical rod for controlled correction of cervical kyphosis. After sustaining a traumatic spinal fracture, a 57-year-old man with AS developed a delayed cervical flexion deformity. The patient was neurologically intact, but suffered from disabling impairment in horizontal gaze and activities of daily living, and from neck pain. The patient subsequently underwent surgical correction via a posterior cervical extension osteotomy at C7-T1 with manual extension of the neck for osteoclastic reduction of the cervical kyphosis. Controlled correction was performed by using a hinged rod affixed to posterior cervical and thoracic screws, allowing for free sagittal correction while restricting translational forces. Once the desired angle of correction was achieved, the hinge connector was locked, transforming the rod into a rigid device for permanent internal fixation. The use of hinged rods in cervical kyphosis correction provides a controlled method for reduction at the osteotomy site, decreasing the risk of neurological injury.

J	Cloutier, JF; Saliba, I				Cloutier, Jean-Francois; Saliba, Issam			Isolated Vertigo and Dizziness of Vascular Origin	JOURNAL OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD & NECK SURGERY			English	Article						isolated vertigo; nystagmus; vertebrobasilar insufficiency; vertigo		Introduction: Vertigo of vascular origin is usually limited to migraine, transient ischemic attacks, and ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke. Excluding migraines, focal neurologic deficits usually allow a fast identification of the impending neural damage and permit a rapid transfer to a stroke team. Few authors have considered that a vascular origin should be thought of in cases of positional vertigo or vertigo not associated with neurologic signs (ie, isolated vertigo) in patients with vascular disease risk factors. Objectives: (1) To present a case series of vertigo and dizziness without vertigo of probable vascular origin and (2) to perform an evidence-based review regarding the incidence of isolated vertigo and dizziness of vascular origin. Design: Retrospective nonrandomized case series. Setting: Tertiary referral centre. Method: (1) All patients from a vertigo clinic found to have vertigo of potential vascular origin had a complete neuro-otologic examination and were investigated by magnetic resonance angiography. (2) A MEDLINE literature search was performed using specific search terms to identify pertinent publications concerning this pathology. They were reviewed and graded according to the quality of their evidence. Results: We identified nine cases of vertigo and dizziness without vertigo of probable vascular origin. We identified 27 818 potentially pertinent articles. A detailed review yielded 13 studies for further analysis. Although isolated vertigo has frequently been reported as the only symptom in case series of cerebellar infarcts, only one article discussed its incidence. Conclusion: Vascular origin should be considered in cases of positional vertigo and isolated vertigo or dizziness when the etiology remains unclear. A single study has determined that 52% of patients with isolated vertigo of unclear etiopathology have posterior circulation anomalies.

Through a specially developed software environment integrating a tracking method and a real-time controller algorithm, a clinical 1.5T Siemens Avanto MRI system is adapted to provide new functionality for potential automated interventional applications. The proposed software architecture was successfully validated through in vivo controlled navigation inside the carotid artery of a swine. Here we present how this MRI-upgraded software environment could also be used in more complex vasculature models through the real-time navigation of a 1.5 mm diameter chrome steel bead in two different MR-compatible phantoms with flowless and quiescent flow conditions. The developed platform and software modules needed for such navigation are also presented. Real-time tracking achieved through a dedicated positioning method based on an off-resonance excitation technique has also been successfully integrated in the software platform while maintaining adequate real-time performance. These preliminary feasibility experiments suggest that navigation of such devices can be achieved using a similar software architecture on other conventional clinical MRI systems at an operational closed-loop control frequency of 32Hz.

We have investigated cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression in vulnerable (medial thalamus, inferior colliculus) and spared (frontal cortex) regions of rats with thiamine deficiency. Expression of COX-2 mRNA was selectively increased (twofold, p < 0.001) in vulnerable regions at symptomatic stages of encephalopathy (14 days) of TD compared to pair-fed controls or presymptomatic (days 12) rats. Induction of COX-2 expression was accompanied by a significant increase (two-to threefold, p < 0.001) in prostanglandin E2 (PGE2) synthesis in vulnerable regions at symptomatic stages of TD. COX-2 immunolabeling revealed a neuronal localization and COX-2 immunoreactive neurons were significantly increased at symptomatic stages of encephalopathy. Administration of nimesulide, a highly specific COX-2 inhibitor, significantly reduced PGE-2 levels in vulnerable regions but, rather than being neuroprotective, precipitated encephalopathy and exacerbated neuronal cell death due to TD. These findings suggest that newly synthesized prostanoids exert a neuroprotective role in TD.

Given that membrane type-1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP) expression is a hallmark of highly invasive, radioresistant, and hypoxic brain tumor cells, we sought to determine whether MT1-MMP and other MMPs could regulate the invasive phenotype of CD133(+) DAOY cells. We found that when DAOY medulloblastoma or U87 glioblastoma cells were implanted in nude mice, only those cells specifically implanted in the brain environment generated CD133(+) brain tumors. Vascular endothelial growth factor and basic fibroblast growth factor gene expression increases in correlation with CD133 expression in those tumors. When DAOY cultures were induced to generate in vitro neurosphere-like cells, gene expression of CD133, MT1-MMP, MMP-9, and MDR-1 was induced and correlated with an increase in neurosphere invasiveness. Specific small interfering RNA gene silencing of either MT1-MMP or MMP-9 reduced the capacity of the DAOY monolayers to generate neurospheres and concomitantly abrogated their invasive capacity. On the other hand, overexpression of MT1-MMP in DAOY triggered neurosphere-like formation which was further amplified when cells were cultured in neurosphere medium. Collectively, we show that both MT1-MMP and MMP-9 contribute to the invasive phenotype during CD133(+) neurosphere-like formation in medulloblastoma cells. Increases in MMP-9 may contribute to the opening of the blood-brain barrier, whereas increased MT1-MMP would promote brain tumor infiltration. Our study suggests that MMP-9 or MT1-MMP targeting may reduce the formation of brain tumor stem cells.

While disruption of the BBB by the brain tumor-secreted matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) favors tumor invasion, the role and regulation of MMP-9 secretion by HBMEC themselves in response to carcinogens or brain tumor-derived growth factors has received little attention. Our study delineates a unique brain endothelial phenotype in that MMP-9 secretion is increased upon phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) treatment of HBMEC. Sulforaphane (SFN), an isothiocyanate present in broccoli which exhibits chemopreventive properties, selectively inhibited the secretion of MMP-9 but not that of MMP-2. The decrease in MMP-9 gene expression correlated with a decrease in the expression of the mRNA stabilizing factor HuR protein triggered by SFN. PMA-induced HBMEC migration was also antagonized by SFN. Silencing of the MMP-9 gene inhibited PMA-induced MMP-9 secretion, cell migration, and in vitro tubulogenesis on Matrigel. While SFN inhibited the chemoattractive abilities of brain tumor-derived growth factors, it failed to inhibit PMA-induced tubulogenesis. Our data are indicative of a selective role for SFN to inhibit MMP-9-activated, but not basal, HBMEC migration, and tubulogenesis whose actions could add to SFN's antitumor properties.

The role of the inhibitor of apoptosis ( IAP) family of anti-apoptotic proteins such as X-linked IAP ( XIAP), human inhibitor of apoptosis-1 (HIAP-1), human inhibitor of apoptosis-2 ( HIAP-2), neuronal apoptosis inhibitory protein ( NAIP) and Survivin in relapsing-remitting, secondaryprogressive, primary-progressive or benign forms of MS is unclear. We report here that expression of the IAP family of genes in peripheral blood samples and brain tissues from MS cases support a role for differential regulation of these potent anti-apoptotic proteins in the pathology of MS. XIAP mRNA and protein levels were elevated in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with active disease relative to normal subjects. In patients with active MS, HIAP-1 and HIAP-2 mRNA levels were elevated in resting T cells while NAIP mRNA was increased in whole blood. In post-mortem MS brain tissue, XIAP and HIAP-1 in myelin lesions were co-localized with microglia and T cells, respectively. Only in primary-progressive patients was Survivin expression elevated suggestive of a distinct pathological basis for this subtype of MS. Taken together, these results suggest that patterns of inhibitor of apoptosis expression in immune cells may have value in distinguishing between MS subtypes and offer insight into the mechanisms responsible for their distinct clinical courses.

Glatiramer acetate after induction therapy with mitoxantrone in relapsing multiple sclerosis	MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS JOURNAL			English	Article						multiple sclerosis; immunology; de-myelinating disease; combination therapy; mitoxantrone; glatiramer acetate; induction therapy	PLACEBO-CONTROLLED TRIAL; NEUROTROPHIC FACTORS; DOUBLE-BLIND; MULTICENTER; NATALIZUMAB; MRI; COPOLYMER-1; MECHANISMS; REACTIVITY; MONOCYTE	Forty relapsing multiple sclerosis patients with 1-15 gadolinium (Gd)- enhancing lesions on screening brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores 0-6.5 were randomized to receive short-term induction therapy with mitoxantrone ( three monthly 12 mg/m(2) infusions) followed by 12 months of daily glatiramer acetate (GA) therapy 20 mg/day subcutaneously for a total of 15 months (M-GA, n = 21) or daily GA 20 mg/day for 15 months ( GA, n = 19). MRI scans were performed at months 6, 9, 12 and 15. The primary measure of outcome was the incidence of adverse events; secondary measures included number of Gd-enhanced lesions, confirmed relapses and EDSS changes. Except age, baseline demographic characteristics were well matched in both treatment arms. Both treatments were safe and well tolerated. M-GA induction produced an 89% greater reduction ( relative risk ( RR) = 0.11, 95% confidence interval ( CI): 0.04-0.36, p = 0.0001) in the number of Gd-enhancing lesions at months 6 and 9 and a 70% reduction ( RR = 0.30, 95% CI: 0.11 - 0.86, p = 0.0147) at months 12 and 15 versus GA alone. Mean relapse rates were 0.16 and 0.32 in the M-GA and GA groups, respectively. Short-term immunosuppression with mitoxantrone followed by daily GA for up to 15 months was found to be safe and effective, with an early and sustained decrease in MRI disease activity.

J	Le Roux, N; Bengio, Y				Le Roux, Nicolas; Bengio, Yoshua			Representational power of restricted Boltzmann machines and deep belief networks	NEURAL COMPUTATION			English	Article								Deep belief networks (DBN) are generative neural network models with many layers of hidden explanatory factors, recently introduced by Hinton, Osindero, and Teh (2006) along with a greedy layer-wise unsupervised learning algorithm. The building block of a DBN is a probabilistic model called a restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM), used to represent one layer of the model. Restricted Boltzmann machines are interesting because inference is easy in them and because they have been successfully used as building blocks for training deeper models. We first prove that adding hidden units yields strictly improved modeling power, while a second theorem shows that RBMs are universal approximators of discrete distributions. We then study the question of whether DBNs with more layers are strictly more powerful in terms of representational power. This suggests a new and less greedy criterion for training RBMs Within DBNs.

Neuroactive steroids and fatigue severity in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis and hepatitis C	NEUROGASTROENTEROLOGY AND MOTILITY			English	Article						allopregnanolone; fatigue; neuroactive steroids; chronic hepatitis C; pregnanolone; primary biliary cirrhosis	MAGNETIC-RESONANCE-SPECTROSCOPY; INCREASED BRAIN CONCENTRATIONS; LIVER-DISEASE; PREMENSTRUAL-SYNDROME; COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; CIRCULATING LEVELS; CHOLESTATIC RATS; MENSTRUAL-CYCLE; IMPACT SCALE; IN-VIVO	Fatigue is one of the most common non-specific symptoms associated with several disease states including liver diseases. Recently, it was reported that levels of progesterone metabolites such as allopregnanolone (3 alpha,5 alpha-tetrahydroprogesterone; 3 alpha,5 alpha-THP) and isopregnanolone (3 beta,5 alpha-THP) were increased in plasma of patients with chronic fatigue syndrome. We hypothesize that THP metabolites might be associated with fatigue commonly observed in chronic liver diseases. We evaluated fatigue scores and plasma levels of five progesterone metabolites in 16 patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), 12 patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC) and 11 age-matched controls. The fatigue impact scale (FIS) ratio was significantly increased (P < 0.01) in patients with PBC and CHC compared to controls. Plasma levels of 3 alpha,5 alpha-THP and pregnanolone (3 alpha,5 beta-THP) were significantly increased in PBC and CHC patients. The other progesterone metabolites, i.e. 3 beta,5 alpha-THP, 3 beta,5 beta-THP and 3 alpha,5 alpha-tetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone were either undetectable or detected only in some patients. Plasma levels of 3 alpha,5 alpha-THP and 3 alpha,5 beta-THP were found to be significantly higher in patients with fatigue (P < 0.05), while those of patients without fatigue were not significantly different from controls. Both 3 alpha,5 alpha-THP and 3 alpha,5 beta-THP are positive allosteric modulators of the gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA-A) receptor and readily cross the blood-brain barrier. The present preliminary findings suggest that increased inhibition through GABA-A receptors due to the accumulation of neuroinhibitory steroids may represent an important pathophysiological mechanism of fatigue in chronic liver diseases.

There are, however, few tools to automatically examine shape differences in the cortices of mice. This paper describes an algorithm for automatically measuring cortical thickness across the entire cortex from MRI of fixed mouse brain specimens. An analysis of the variance of the method showed that, on average, a 50 mu m (0.05 mm) localised difference in cortical thickness can be measured using MR scans. Applying these methods to 8-month-old YAC128 mouse model mice representing an early stage of HD, we found an increase in cortical thickness in the sensorimotor cortex, and also revealed regions wherein decreasing striatal volume correlated with increasing cortical thickness, indicating a potential compensatory response.

We describe a French-Canadian cluster of 17 recessive CMT cases belonging to 10 families with variable early-onset CMT and scoliosis. The patients demonstrate great intra-and inter-familial variability. Linkage analysis confirmed that all families are linked to CMT4C locus on chromosome 5q32 (multipoint LOD score of 9.06). Haplotype analysis suggests that two SH3TC2 mutations are present in this cohort. The majority of carrier chromosomes, 26 of 34 (76%), carry the c.2860C -> T mutation. Despite extensive sequencing, the other mutation is not yet uncovered. This study demonstrates that the clinical variability observed in CMT4C is due to other factors than the nature of the mutation and that further work is needed to better define the SH3TC2 gene to ensure the identification of all CMT4C mutations.

Estrogen administration negatively alters mood following monoaminergic depletion and psychosocial stress in postmenopausal women	NEUROPSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						estrogen; menopause; monoamines; stress; mood	ACUTE TRYPTOPHAN DEPLETION; QUALITY-OF-LIFE; CORTICOTROPIN-RELEASING HORMONE; PITUITARY-ADRENAL AXIS; DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS; SEX-DIFFERENCES; MENOPAUSAL TRANSITION; REPLACEMENT THERAPY; ENDOCRINE RESPONSES; MENSTRUAL-CYCLE	Differences in the rates of affective disorders between women and men may relate to gender differences in gonadal steroid levels such as estrogen that have effects on brain monoamines important to mood regulation. Changes in estrogen secretion patterns during the perimenopause and menopause may be relevant to the increased risk for affective symptoms at that time. This study examined whether 17 beta-estradiol (E2) administration can modify the mood effects of experimental psychosocial stress following acute monoamine depletion in postmenopausal women. Subjects consisted of 15 normal postmenopausal women (PMW) (ages 67.1 +/- 711.2 years) blindly placed on either oral placebo or E2 (1 mg/day for 1 month, then 2 mg/ day for 2 months). At the end of the 3-month treatment phase, subjects participated in three blinded depletion challenges in which they ingested each of three amino-acid mixtures: deficient in tryptophan, deficient in phenylalanine/tyrosine, or nutritionally balanced. After 5 h, subjects performed the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST), followed by mood and anxiety ratings. E2-treated subjects exhibited a significant increase in negative mood and anxiety after the TSST compared to placebo-treated women. These effects were independent of monoamine depletion and were not manifest before the TSST or at baseline. Exogenous estrogen administration in PMW may alter or modulate emotional reactivity to stressful events and may alter the sensitivity of emotional regulation. This modulation appears to be independent of alterations in monoaminergic neurotransmission. The dose of estrogen used after menopause may be important in determining the effects of gonadal steroids on emotional regulation.

RGCs, like other central nervous system neurons, have a limited capacity to survive or regenerate an axon after injury. Strategies that prevent or slow down RGC degeneration, in combination with intraocular pressure management, may be beneficial to preserve vision in glaucoma. Recent progress in neurobiological research has led to a better understanding of the molecular pathways that regulate the survival of injured RGCs. Here we discuss a variety of experimental strategies including intraocular delivery of neuroprotective molecules, viral-mediated gene transfer, cell implants and stem cell therapies, which share the ultimate goal of promoting RGC survival after optic nerve damage. The challenge now is to asses's how this wealth of knowledge can be translated into viable therapies for the treatment of glaucoma and other optic neuropathies.

Ejaculatory sensations during vibrator and midodrine stimulation in men suffering from damage to the spinal cord	PELVI-PERINEOLOGIE			French	Article						ejaculation; spinal cord injury; midodrine; paraplegia; tetraplegia; vibromassage	INJURED MEN; SEXUAL FUNCTION; SELF-STIMULATION; ELECTROEJACULATION; QUALITY; ORGASM; SEMEN; WOMEN	Since the first studies on midodrine hydrochloride, carried out in Europe and Canada (Quebec), we have been interested in the somatic and autonomic sensations that might be associated with ejaculation in men suffering from lesion to the spinal cord. Since ejaculation is associated with sympathetic activity, since midodrine is an alpha stimulating drug and since sympathetic activity can be transmitted to the brain through several neural pathways, we hypothesized that ejaculation might be associated with autonomic perceptions despite the spinal lesions. A total of 41 tetraplegic and paraplegic men with lesions located between C2-T2 and T3-T6 achieved ejaculation with penile vibrator stimulation with and without midodrine. The results showed that systolic blood pressure increased in tetraplegic men by 51 mmHg (113 to 164 mmHg) at ejaculation, with little difference between patients using midodrine and those using vibrator stimulation alone. In contrast, paraplegic men using midodrine showed an increase in systolic blood pressure of 39 mmHg at ejaculation, as opposed to 13 mmHg when vibrator stimulation was used without midodrine. Heart rate measures showed a decrease in all subjects at ejaculation (from 8 to 24b/min) with greater changes recorded amongst paraplegic men using midodrine. Physiological sensations were perceived more frequently when ejaculation occurred as opposed to when it failed, the sensations being reported more frequently when vibrator stimulation was used alone as opposed to when it was used with midodrine. These physiological sensations (cardiovascular, muscular, autonomic) were more frequently reported than orgasmic sensations (relaxing, climactic, intimate). The results suggest that midodrine has less effect on tetraplegic men than paraplegic, possibly because maximal sympathetic activity already occurs in tetraplegic men as a result of autonomic dysreflexia triggered by ejaculation. The sensations also appeared more generalized when ejaculation was triggered by vibrator stimulation alone, suggesting that they occur as a result of the ejaculation itself and not as a side effect of medication. The results are discussed in terms of their clinical applications affecting the autonomy of men suffering from damage to the spinal cord.

After the cloning of calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CLR) and receptor activity-modifying proteins (RAMPs), it became clear that the CGRP1 receptor was a complex between CLR and RAMP1. It is now apparent that the CGRP2 receptor phenotype is the result of CGRP acting at receptors for amylin and adrenomedullin. Accordingly, the term "CGRP2" receptor should no longer be used, and the "CGRP1" receptor should be known as the "CGRP" receptor.

Neurotoxic Effects of Zoniporide: A Selective Inhibitor of the Na+/H+ Exchanger Isoform 1	TOXICOLOGIC PATHOLOGY			English	Article						zoniporide; Na+/H+ exchanger; neurotoxicity; nerve fiber degeneration; nerve conduction velocity; patellar reflex; neurological examination	MOUSE; SEIZURES; POTENT; NHE1	Zoniporide, an inhibitor of the Na+-H+ exchanger-1, was administered by continuous intravenous infusion to rats and dogs for up to 1 month. In 1-month studies, histological and functional changes were observed in select portions of the peripheral nervous system; however, these findings were not detected in 2-week studies at similar or higher doses. In the 1-month rat study, there was dose-dependent, minimal, focal, or multifocal nerve fiber ( axonal) degeneration in the spinal cord and/or sciatic nerve. In a follow-up rat study, findings included slowing of caudal nerve conduction velocity and axonal degeneration in the spinal cord ( dorsal funiculus), dorsal roots, dorsal root ganglia (DRG), radial, sciatic, and tibial nerves. In the 1-month dog study, there was impairment of the patellar reflex and associated postural reaction changes, minimal to marked proximal nerve fiber degeneration in the DRG, and minimal nerve fiber degeneration in the dorsal roots and funiculi of the spinal cord. Minimal nerve fiber degeneration of equivocal significance was noted in various peripheral nerves. Taken together, these findings were consistent with a specific effect on peripheral sensory nerve fibers. These studies demonstrated that zoniporide produces clinical, electrophysiologic, and microscopic evidence of peripheral sensory axonopathy and establishes the importance of careful preclinical evaluation of neurological function.

We herein report a case of chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy associated with the use of sirolimus-based immunosuppression. The patient was treated by converting the immunosuppression from sirolimus to cyclosporine and by a short course of oral steroids. Following this, we observed almost complete clinical and electrophysiologic resolution of this syndrome. We believe that this is the first described case of such a complication occurring in association with sirolimus. This immunosuppressive agent can, therefore, lead to neurological complications similar to the ones that have been observed with calcineurin inhibitors.

Basal temporal sulcal morphology in healthy controls and patients with temporal lobe epilepsy	NEUROLOGY			English	Article							FOCAL CORTICAL DYSPLASIA; HIPPOCAMPAL SCLEROSIS; HUMAN-BRAIN; WILLIAMS-SYNDROME; MRI; CORTEX; SCHIZOPHRENIA; TEMPOROPOLAR; GYRIFICATION; VARIABILITY	Background: We previously demonstrated that shape variants of the hippocampal formation are more prevalent in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) than in healthy individuals. Objective: To categorize sulcal patterns of the basal temporal lobe in TLE compared to healthy controls. Methods: We studied 51 healthy controls and 69 patients with TLE (37 left, 32 right TLE). Brain sulci were identified and labeled automatically on MRI using an algorithm based on a congregation of neural networks that allows mapping three-dimensional sulcal models on the cortical surface. We used four sulcal patterns classes to categorize the sulcal arrangement in the inferior surface of the temporal lobe in each subject: Type 1, i.e., single-branch, unbroken collateral sulcus (CS) connected with the rhinal sulcus (RS) anteriorly; Type 2, i.e., CS connected with the occipitotemporal sulcus (OTS), but separated from the RS; Type 3, i.e., CS separated from the OTS and RS, which are connected; and Type 4, i.e., CS, OTS and RS separated. Results: In healthy controls, Type 1 and Type 2 were the patterns seen most frequently. Overall, 82% (42/51) of subjects had the same sulcal pattern in both temporal lobes. Inter-rater reliability for 35 randomly selected subjects indicated excellent agreement (Cohen's Kappa: 0.84). Compared to controls, we found an increased frequency of Type 1 CS in patients with TLE, both in the left (77% vs 47%, p = 0.004) and the right hemispheres (72% vs 41%, p = 0.002). On the other hand, we found a decreased frequency of Type 2 CS in patients with TLE, both in the left (4% vs 31%, p = 0.00002) and the right hemisphere ( 4% vs 35%, p < 0.00001). Conclusions: A single-branch, unbroken collateral sulcus is the predominant sulcal pattern found in temporal lobe epilepsy. This "simplified" arrangement may be an indicator of neurodevelopmental deviance associated with this condition.

FosB mutant (-/-) postpartum mice and virgin mice that are exposed to pups show defective nurturing behavior. The FosB (-/-) MPOA fails to fully up-regulate SPRY1 and Rad, the feedback regulators of ERK and calcium signaling, respectively. Here we studied FosB function by examining the gene expression profiles and the behavioral characteristics of FosB (-/-) mice. We found that FosB (-/vertical bar-) mice exhibited not only decreased parenting but also decreased infanticide compared with (+/) littermates. We then performed gene expression analysis in the MPOA of FosB (-/-) mice compared with the wild-type littermates. We found up-regulation of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), C4, and Ela1 mRNA in the MPOA of FosB (-/-) mice; all of these gene products were implicated in general neuropathological conditions. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that up-regulation of GFAP was not restricted to MPOA but extended throughout the forebrain, including the cerebral cortex and striatum. Such pervasive GFAP up-regulation suggested that FosB (-/-) mice might have other behavioral abnormalities than nurturing. indeed, these mice showed a clear alteration in emotionality, detected by the acoustic startle, elevated plus maze, and passive avoidance tests. These results suggest that FosB (-/-) mice have broader neurobehavioral dysfunctions, with which the nurturing defect might share the common mechanism. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this paper, we aimed at detecting the structural and functional deficits in humans with amblyopia, with the aid of anatomic magnetic resonance imaging (aMRI) and functional MRI (fMRI). We designed the visual stimulus to investigate the functional deficits, and delineated the V1/V2 areas by retinotopic mapping. Then we performed the brain parcellation to calculate the volume of the subcortical structure on each individual, and reconstructed the cortical surfaces to measure the cortical thickness. At last, the statistical comparison was carried out to find the structural abnormities and their relationship to the functional deficits. Compared with the normal controls, it is found that the hemisphere difference existed on the unilateral amblyopia subjects, and the functional deficit might come along with the changes in the cortical volume, especially in the occipital lobe. The examined results may provide insight to the study of the neural substrates of amblyopia. Crown Copyright (C) 2008 Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Maternal Programming of Sexual Behavior and Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Gonadal Function in the Female Rat	PLOS ONE			English	Article							CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; HORMONE-RELEASING HORMONE; ESTROGEN-RECEPTOR-ALPHA; MEDIAL PREOPTIC AREA; MESSENGER-RNA LEVELS; LUTEINIZING-HORMONE; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; REPRODUCTIVE STRATEGIES; PUBERTAL MATURATION; GENE-EXPRESSION	Variations in parental care predict the age of puberty, sexual activity in adolescence and the age at first pregnancy in humans. These findings parallel descriptions of maternal effects on phenotypic variation in reproductive function in other species. Despite the prevalence of such reports, little is known about potential biological mechanisms and this especially true for effects on female reproductive development. We examined the hypothesis that parental care might alter hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian function and thus reproductive function in the female offspring of rat mothers that vary pup licking/grooming (LG) over the first week postpartum. As adults, the female offspring of Low LG mothers showed 1) increased sexual receptivity; 2) increased plasma levels of luteinizing hormone (LH) and progesterone at proestrus; 3) an increased positive-feedback effect of estradiol on both plasma LH levels and gonadotropin releasing-hormone (GnRH) expression in the medial preoptic region; and 4) increased estrogen receptor alpha (ER alpha) expression in the anterioventral paraventricular nucleus, a system that regulates GnRH. The results of a cross-fostering study provide evidence for a direct effect of postnatal maternal care as well as a possible prenatal influence. Indeed, we found evidence for increased fetal testosterone levels at embryonic day 20 in the female fetuses of High compared to Low LG mothers. Finally, the female offspring of Low LG mothers showed accelerated puberty compared to those of High LG mothers. These data suggest maternal effects in the rat on the development of neuroendocrine systems that regulate female sexual behaviour. Together with studies revealing a maternal effect on the maternal behavior of the female offspring, these findings suggest that maternal care can program alternative reproductive phenotypes in the rat through regionally-specific effects on ER alpha expression.

This question is important because a positive finding would suggest that perception and imagery of visual stimuli are mediated by shared neural networks. In this study, we used a selective adaptation procedure designed to induce high-level face-identity aftereffects - a phenomenon in which extended exposure to a particular face facilitates recognition of subsequent faces with opposite features while impairing recognition of all other faces. We report here that adaptation to either real or imagined faces produces a similar shift in perception and that identity boundaries represented in real and imagined faces are equivalent. Together, our results show that identity information contained in imagined and real faces produce similar behavioral outcomes. Our findings of high-level visual aftereffects induced by imagined stimuli can be taken as evidence for the involvement of shared neural networks that mediate perception and imagery of complex visual stimuli.

Systemic Lupus Int Collaborating C	Short-term outcome of neuropsychiatric events in systemic lupus erythematosus upon enrollment into an international inception cohort study	ARTHRITIS & RHEUMATISM-ARTHRITIS CARE & RESEARCH			English	Article							CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; COGNITIVE DYSFUNCTION; CLINICAL-TRIAL; PREVALENCE; DISEASE; MANIFESTATIONS; MORTALITY; CYCLOPHOSPHAMIDE; POPULATION; PREDICTORS	Objective. To determine the short-term outcome of neuropsychiatric (NP) events upon enrollment into an international inception cohort of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Methods. The study was performed by the Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics. Patients were enrolled within 15 months of SLE diagnosis and NP events were characterized using the American College of Rheumatology case definitions. Decision rules were derived to identify NP events attributable to SLE. Physician outcome scores of NP events and patient-derived mental component summary (MCS) and physical component summary (PCS) scores of the Short Form 36 were recorded. Results. There were 890 patients (88.7% female) with a mean +/- SD age of 33.8 +/- 13.4 years and mean disease duration of 5.3 +/- 4.2 months. Within the enrollment window, 271 (33.5%) of 890 patients had at least 1 NP event encompassing 15 NP syndromes. NP events attributed to SLE varied from 16.5% to 33.9% using alternate attribution models and occurred in 6.0-11.5% of patients. Outcome scores for NP events attributed to SLE were significantly better than for NP events due to non-SLE causes. Higher global disease activity was associated with worse outcomes. MCS scores were lower in patients with NP events, regardless of attribution, and were also lower in patients with diffuse and central NP events. There was a significant association between physician outcome scores and patient MCS scores only for NP events attributed to SLE. Conclusion. In SLE patients, the short-term outcome of NP events is determined by both the characteristics and attribution of the events. Conclusion. In SLE patients, the short-term outcome of NP events is determined by both the characteristics and attribution of the events.	[Hanly, J. G.; Douglas, J.; Qi, K.

In this article we address the important problem of disambiguating such complex subvoxel fibre tract configurations, with the purpose of improving the performance of fibre tractography. We do so by extending a curve inference method to distinguish between the cases of curving and fanning fibre bundles using differential geometric estimates in a local neighbourhood. The key benefit of this method is the inference of curves, instead of only fibre orientations, to model the underlying fibre bundles. This in turn allows distinct fibre geometries that contain nearly identical sets of fibre orientations at a voxel, to be distinguished from one another. Experimental results demonstrate the ability of the method to successfully label voxels into one of the above categories and improve the performance of a fibre-tracking algorithm.

Implication of caspases and subcellular compartments in tert-butylhydroperoxide induced apoptosis	TOXICOLOGY AND APPLIED PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						apoptosis; caspase; tert-butylhydroperoxide; oxidative stress; hepatocyte; calpain	HYDROPEROXIDE-INDUCED APOPTOSIS; CELL-DEATH; TROUT HEPATOCYTES; ACTIVATION; MITOCHONDRIAL; CALPAIN; RELEASE; CALCIUM; PROTEASES; ISCHEMIA	Oxidative stress has been implicated in many physiopathologies including neurodegenerative diseases, cancer, cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, and in mechanisms of action of environmental toxicants. tert-butylhydroperoxide (t-BHP) is an organic lipid hydroperoxide analogue, which is commonly used as a pro-oxidant for evaluating mechanisms involving oxidative stress in cells and tissues. This study investigates mechanisms of apoptosis induced by oxidative stress in hepatocytes, in particular, the involvement of caspases and subcellular compartments. Freshly isolated hepatocytes were exposed to 0.4 mM t-BHP during 1 h. A general caspase inhibitor, Boc-D-FMK, reduced t-BHP-induced apoptosis (chromatin condensation), confirming the involvement of caspases in apoptosis. A caspase-9 inhibitor, Z-LEHD-FMK, also reduced t-BHP-induced apoptosis, suggesting that caspase-9 plays a critical role in this process. Procaspase-9 underwent cleavage in mitochondria and translocation to the nucleus, where increased caspase-9 activity was detected. The caspase-9 substrates, caspase-3 and caspase-7, were not activated. Caspase-7 was translocated from the cytosol to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where it underwent processing; however, enzymatic activity of caspase-7 was inhibited by t-BHP. t-BHP caused cleavage of procaspase-12 at the ER and its subsequent translocation to the nucleus, where increased caspase-12 activity was found. t-BHP caused translocation of calpain from the cytosol to the ER. Calpain inhibition reduced chromatin condensation and caspase-12 activity in the nucleus, suggesting that calpain is involved in caspase-12 activation and apoptosis. This study demonstrates that caspase-9 and caspase-12 are activated in t-BHP-induced apoptosis in hepatocytes. We highlight the importance of subcellular compartments such as mitochondria, ER and nuclei in the apoptotic process. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

SSTR regulate the secretion of hormones, growth factors, neurotransmission and cell growth in receptor-specific manner. In addition, SST plays an inhibitory role in several mammary cancer models. These effects are mediated both indirectly through inhibition of hormones and growth factors which promote tumor growth as well as directly via SSTRs present on tumor cells to inhibit mitogenic signaling of growth factor receptor kinases leading to growth arrest and induction of apoptosis. Here, we present an overview on the role of SST and its analogs in breast cancer. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Proneurotrophins require endocytosis and intracellular proteolysis to induce TrkA activation	JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							NERVE GROWTH-FACTOR; P75 NEUROTROPHIN RECEPTOR; SIGNALING ENDOSOME; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; PRO-PEPTIDE; CELL-DEATH; PROTEIN; BRAIN; FURIN; NGF	The uncleaved, pro-form of nerve growth factor (proNGF) functions as a pro-apoptotic ligand for the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR). However, some reports have indicated that proneurotrophins bind and activate Trk receptors. In this study, we have examined proneurotrophin receptor binding and activation properties in an attempt to reconcile these findings. We show that proNGF readily binds p75NTR expressed in HEK293T cells but does not interact with TrkA expressed under similar circumstances. Importantly, proNGF activates TrkA tyrosine phosphorylation, induces Erk and Akt activation, and causes PC12 cell differentiation. We show that inhibiting endocytosis or furin activity reduced TrkA activation induced by proNGF but not that induced by mature NGF and that proNGF123, a mutant form of NGF lacking dibasic cleavage sites in the prodomain, does not induce TrkA phosphorylation in PC12 cells. Therefore, endocytosis and cleavage appear to be prerequisites for proNGF-induced TrkA activity. We also found that proBDNF induces activation of TrkB in cerebellar granule neurons and that proBDNF cleavage by furin and metalloproteases facilitates this effect. Taken together, these data indicate that under physiological conditions, proneurotrophins do not directly bind or activate Trk receptors. However, endocytosis and cleavage of proneurotrophins produce processed forms of neurotrophins that are capable of inducing Trk activation.

Psychophysical studies suggested that CT afferents contribute to affective but not to discriminative aspects of tactile stimulation. We have now examined cortical processing following CT stimulation in a second similarly deafferented subject (IW), as well as revisited the data from GL. The results in IW showed similar activation of posterior insular cortex following CT stimulation as in GL and so strengthen the view that CT afferents underpin emotional aspects of touch. In addition, CT stimulation evoked significant fMRI deactivation in somatosensory cortex in both subjects supporting the notion that CT is not a system for discriminative touch.

Resolving this question has proven difficult, in large part because of the sizeable uncertainty inherent in estimating or measuring the joint torques and muscle forces that underlie movements made by biological limbs. We circumvented this difficulty by considering single-neuron responses in an isometric task, where joint torques and muscle forces can be straightforwardly computed from limb geometry. The response for each neuron was modeled as a linear function of a "preferred" joint torque vector, and this model was fit to individual neural responses across variations in limb posture. The resulting goodness of fit suggests that neurons in motor cortex do encode the kinetics of motor behavior and that the neural response properties of "preferred direction" and "gain" are dual components of a unitary response vector.

Methodology/Principal Findings: We test here by sodium bisulfite mapping of the rRNA promoter and quantitative realtime PCR of rRNA expression the hypothesis that epigenetic differences in critical loci in the brain are involved in the pathophysiology of suicide. Suicide subjects in this study were selected for a history of early childhood neglect/abuse, which is associated with decreased hippocampal volume and cognitive impairments. rRNA was significantly hypermethylated throughout the promoter and 59 regulatory region in the brain of suicide subjects, consistent with reduced rRNA expression in the hippocampus. This difference in rRNA methylation was not evident in the cerebellum and occurred in the absence of genome-wide changes in methylation, as assessed by nearest neighbor. Conclusions/Significance: This is the first study to show aberrant regulation of the protein synthesis machinery in the suicide brain. The data implicate the epigenetic modulation of rRNA in the pathophysiology of suicide.

Mild cognitive impairment and cognitive impairment without dementia	CANADIAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION JOURNAL			English	Review							RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIAL; ACADEMY-OF-NEUROLOGY; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; OLDER-ADULTS; ELDERLY SUBJECTS; NO DEMENTIA; APOLIPOPROTEIN-E; CEREBROVASCULAR-DISEASE; PRECLINICAL PREDICTION; REVERSIBLE DEMENTIA	Background: Mild cognitive impairment and cognitive impairment, no dementia, are emerging terms that encompass the clinical state between normal cognition and dementia in elderly people. Controversy surrounds their characterization, definition and application in clinical practice. In this article, we provide physicians with practical guidance on the definition, diagnosis and treatment of mild cognitive impairment and cognitive impairment, no dementia, based on recommendations from the Third Canadian Consensus Conference on the Diagnosis and Treatment of Dementia, held in March 2006. Methods: We developed evidence- based guidelines using systematic literature searches, with specific criteria for study selection and quality assessment, and a clear and transparent decision- making process. We selected studies published from January 1996 to December 2005 that had mild cognitive impairment or cognitive impairment, no dementia, as the outcome. Subsequent to the conference, we searched for additional articles published between January 2006 and January 2008. We graded the strength of evidence using the criteria of the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care. Results: We identified 2483 articles, of which 314 were considered to be relevant and of good or fair quality. From a synthesis of the evidence in these studies, we made 16 recommendations. In brief, family physicians should be aware that most types of dementia are preceded by a recognizable phase of mild cognitive decline. They should be familiar with the concepts of mild cognitive impairment and of cognitive impairment, no dementia. Patients with these conditions should be closely monitored because of their increased risk for dementia. Leisure activities, cognitive stimulation and physical activity could be promoted as part of a healthy lifestyle in elderly people and those with mild cognitive impairment. Vascular risk factors should be treated optimally. No other specific therapies can yet be recommended. Interpretation: Physicians will increasingly see elderly patients with mild memory loss, and learning an approach to diagnosing states such as mild cognitive impairment is now warranted. Close monitoring for progression to dementia, promotion of a healthy lifestyle and treatment of vascular risk factors are recommended for the management of patients with mild cognitive impairment.

Isolated cytochrome C oxidase deficiency in G93A SOD1 mice overexpressing CCS protein	JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							AMYOTROPHIC-LATERAL-SCLEROSIS; MOTOR-NEURON DEGENERATION; OXIDATIVE-PHOSPHORYLATION; TRANSGENIC MICE; CELL-DEATH; HEME-A; HYPERTROPHIC CARDIOMYOPATHY; MITOCHONDRIAL DYSFUNCTION; NATIVE-ELECTROPHORESIS; BIOSYNTHETIC-PATHWAY	G93A SOD1 transgenic mice overexpressing CCS protein develop an accelerated disease course that is associated with enhanced mitochondrial pathology and increased mitochondrial localization of mutant SOD1. Because these results suggest an effect of mutant SOD1 on mitochondrial function, we assessed the enzymatic activities of mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes in the spinal cords of CCS/G93A SOD1 and control mice. CCS/G93A SOD1 mouse spinal cord demonstrates a 55% loss of complex IV (cytochrome c oxidase) activity compared with spinal cord from age-matched non-transgenic or G93A SOD1 mice. In contrast, CCS/G93A SOD1 spinal cord shows no reduction in the activities of complex I, II, or III. Blue native gel analysis further demonstrates a marked reduction in the levels of complex IV but not of complex I, II, III, or V in spinal cords of CCS/G93A SOD1 mice compared with non-transgenic, G93A SOD1, or CCS/WT SOD1 controls. With SDS-PAGE analysis, spinal cords from CCS/G93A SOD1 mice showed significant decreases in the levels of two structural subunits of cytochrome c oxidase, COX1 and COX5b, relative to controls. In contrast, CCS/G93A SOD1 mouse spinal cord showed no reduction in levels of selected subunits from complexes I, II, III, or V. Heme A analyses of spinal cord further support the existence of cytochrome c oxidase deficiency in CCS/G93A SOD1 mice. Collectively, these results establish that CCS/G93A SOD1 mice manifest an isolated complex IV deficiency which may underlie a substantial part of mutant SOD1-induced mitochondrial cytopathy.

We derived the strain tensor field induced by a sinusoidal surface sliding on a finger as well as the field created by a tactile transducer array deforming the fingerpad skin by lateral traction. We found that the first field could be well approximated by the second. Our results have several implications. First, tactile displays using lateral skin deformation can generate tactile sensations similar to those using normal skin deformation. Second, a synthesis approach can achieve this result if some constraints on the design of tactile stimulators are met. Third, the mechanoreceptors embedded in the skin must respond to the deviatoric part of the strain tensor field and not to its volumetric part. Finally, many tactile stimuli might represent, for the brain, an inverse problem to be solved, such specific examples of "tactile metameres" are given.

Neurologic and neuropsychological symptoms during the first year after an electric shock: results of a prospective multicenter study	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE			English	Article							INJURY; SEQUELAE; BURNS	Objectives: To assess the prevalence of neurologic and neuropsychological symptoms in the short-term and 1 year after an electric shock and to explore whether any of these were associated with risk factors. Methods: Patients presenting to one of 21 EDs between October 2000 and November 2004 were eligible to be enrolled in a prospective observational study after an electric shock if they had risk factors for late arrhythmias. Telephone follow-up was done to evaluate the appearance of symptoms. Results: A total of 30 (26%) of 114 patients complained of neurologic or neuropsychological symptoms at a median of 52 days post-electric shock. At 1 year, 24 (28%) of 86 patients complained of neurologic or neuropsychological symptoms. None of the risk factors evaluated were associated with the symptoms. Conclusion: The prevalence of the symptoms we observed should alarm all emergency physicians that the effect of electricity can cause late neurologic and neuropsychological manifestations.

Design: Cross-sectional study of a population-based cohort. Setting: Saguenay Youth Study, Quebec, Canada. Participants: A total of 324 adolescents, aged 12 to 18 years. Intervention: Measures were compared between males and females with "high" or "low" intra-abdominal fat (IAF). Main Outcome Measures: Intra-abdominal fat was quantified with magnetic resonance imaging. Primary outcome measures were blood pressure (BP) and fasting serum glucose, insulin, lipids, and C-reactive protein levels. Secondary mechanistic measures were cardiovascular variability indexes of autonomic nervous system function, pubertal development, and serum levels of cortisol, leptin, and sex hormones. Results: The MS was completely absent in adolescents with low IAF and was present in 13.8% of males and 8.3% of females with high IAF. Excess IAF was associated with a higher homeostasis model assessment index (0.5 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.3 to 0.8]; P<.001) and triglycerides level (17.7 mg/dL [to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.0113] [95% CI, 9.7 to 25.7 mg/dL]; P<.001), lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level (-3.9 mg/dL [to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.0259] [95% CI, -6.2 to -1.5 mg/dL]; P=.003), and higher C-reactive protein level (0.03 mg/L [to convert to nanomoles per liter, multiply by 9.524] [95% CI, 0.01 to 0.05 mg/L]; P=.003). High IAF was associated with elevations of BP and sympathetic activity in males only (higher systolic BP, 6 mm Hg [95% CI, 1 to 11 mm Hg]; P=.02 and low-frequency power of diastolic BP, 629 mm Hg-2 [95% CI, 37 to 1222 mm Hg-2]; P=.04). Conclusions: Our results suggest that, already in adolescence, accumulation of IAF may promote development of the MS, affecting the metabolic and inflammatory components similarly in both sexes but influencing BP adversely only in males. The latter may be attributed, in part, to the augmentation of sympathetic activity also seen only in males.

Ratings of valence, arousal, and intensity for eight emotions were collected for each vocalization from 30 participants. Analyses revealed high recognition accuracies for most of the emotional categories (mean of 68%). They also revealed significant effects of both the actors' and the participants' gender: The highest hit rates (75%) were obtained for female participants rating female vocalizations, and the lowest hit rates (60%) for male participants rating male vocalizations. Interestingly, the mixed situations that is, male participants rating female vocalizations or female participants rating male vocalizations-yielded similar, intermediate ratings.

The human ventromedial frontal lobe is critical for learning from negative feedback	BRAIN			English	Article						decision making; orbitofrontal cortex; reversal learning; neuroeconomics; lesion	PRIMATE ORBITOFRONTAL CORTEX; DECISION-MAKING; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; BASAL GANGLIA; HUMAN BRAIN; REWARD; DOPAMINE; REVERSAL; PARKINSONISM; DISSOCIATION	Are positive and negative feedback weighed in a common balance in the brain, or do they influence behaviour through distinct neural mechanisms Recent neuroeconomic studies in both human and non-human primates indicate that the ventromedial frontal lobe carries information about both losses and gains, suggesting that this region may encode value across the continuum from absolute negative to absolute positive outcomes. However, such work does not specify whether or how this value information is applied during behaviour. Observations of patients with ventromedial frontal damage indicate that this region is critical for certain forms of reinforcement learning and value-based decision-making, but the underlying processes remain unclear. We disentangled the influence of cumulative positive and negative feedback on subsequent behaviour with a probabilistic reinforcement learning task in 11 patients with ventromedial frontal damage, 9 lesioned controls and 24 healthy controls, and found that ventromedial frontal damage selectively disrupted the ability to learn from negative feedback.

However, ancillary testing is required when there are factors confounding the clinical determination or when it is impossible to complete the minimum clinical criteria. At the time of the 2003 Canadian Forum clarifying the criteria for brain death, 4-vessel cerebral angiography or radionuclide angiography were the recommended tests and the electroencephalogram was no longer supported. At the request of practitioners in the field, the Canadian Council for Donation and Transplantation sponsored the assembly of neuroradiology and neurocritical care experts to make further recommendations regarding the use of ancillary testing. At minimum, patients referred for ancillary testing should be in a deep unresponsive coma with an established etiology, in the absence of reversible conditions accounting for the unresponsiveness and the clinical examination should be performed to the fullest extent possible. For newborns, children and adults, demonstration of the absence of brain blood flow by following recommended imaging techniques fulfill the criteria for ancillary testing: 1. radionuclide angiography or CT angiography 2. traditional 4-vessel angiography 3. Magnetic resonance angiography or Xenon CT. In the absence of neuroimaging, an established cardiac arrest, as defined by the permanent loss of circulation, fulfills the ancillary criteria for the absence of brain blood flow. Acknowledging the existing limitations in this field, further research validating current or evolving techniques of brain blood flow imaging are recommended.

Hedonic feeding, which can be triggered by visual or olfactory food cues, involves brain regions that play a role in reward and motivation, while homeostatic feeding is thought to be under the control of circulating hormones acting primarily on the hypothalamus. Ghrelin is a peptide hormone secreted by the gut that causes hunger and food consumption. Here, we show that ghrelin administered intravenously to healthy volunteers during functional magnetic resonance imaging increased the neural response to food pictures in regions of the brain, including the amygdala, orbitofrontal cortex, anterior insula, and striatum, implicated in encoding the incentive value of food cues. The effects of ghrelin on the amygdala and OFC response were correlated with self-rated hunger ratings. This demonstrates that metabolic signals such as ghrelin may favor food consumption by enhancing the hedonic and incentive responses to food-related cues.

This cue invariance is also manifested in similar orientation maps to these stimuli, but in V1/A17 the illusory contour maps appear reversed. We hypothesized that this map reversal depends upon the spatial frequencies of the inducers in the illusory contours, relative to the spatial selectivities of these brain areas. We employed intrinsic signal optical imaging to measure orientation maps in cat A17/18 to illusory contours with inducers at spatial frequencies from 0.15 to 1.6 cpd. A17 illusory contour maps were indeed reversed compared with grating-driven maps for inducer spatial frequencies < 1.3 cpd, whereas A18 maps were invariant. Simulations based on known neurophysiology demonstrated that map reversal can arise from linear filtering, and map invariance can be explained by a nonlinear (filter-rectify-filter) mechanism. The simulation also correctly predicted that A17 could show invariant maps when the inducer spatial frequency is sufficiently high (1.6 cpd), and that A18 maps could reverse at lower inducer frequencies (0.18 cpd). Thus, the map reversal or invariance to illusory contours depends critically on the relationship of the inducer spatial frequencies to the spatial filtering properties of neurons in each brain area.

Design: Prospective serial study with male athletes using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Setting: Hospital laboratory and imaging facility. Participants: 9 symptomatic concussed athletes who experienced persisting PCS at least I month postinjury and 6 healthy athletes. Interventions: All athletes filled out a PCS checklist and underwent an fMRI session during which they performed a working-memory task. Main outcome measurements: Behavioral outcomes were response speed and accuracy on the working memory tasks performed during the fMRI session. Functional imaging outcomes were blood oxygen level-dependent fMRI activation patterns associated with a working memory task. Results: There was no difference in behavioral performance between the groups. Despite normal structural MRI findings, all symptomatic concussed athletes initially showed atypical brain activation patterns in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPC). Compared to the initial postinjury evaluation, those athletes at follow-up with PCS resolved showed significant increases in activation in the left DLPC. Concussed athletes whose PCS status remained unchanged at follow-up continued to show atypical activation in DLPC. Healthy athletes showed remarkably clear and consistent brain activations in DLPC initially as well as in follow-up, highlighting the test-retest reliability of fMRI. Conclusions: The results demonstrate the feasibility of using fMRI to detect an underlying pathology in symptomatic concussed athletes with normal structural imaging results and its potential to document recovery. Such information may be of considerable value for clinical judgment and patient management.

This review may serve as an initial step toward a comprehensive reference guide for physicians to locate published nomograms that apply to the clinical decision in question, Using MEDLINE a literature search was performed on prostate cancer predictive tools from January 1966 to November 2007. We describe the patient populations to which they apply and the outcomes predicted, and record their individual characteristics. Recent findings The literature search generated 111 published prediction tools that may be applied to patients in various clinical stages of disease. Of the 111 prediction tools, only 69 had undergone validation. We present an inventory of models with input variables, prediction form, number of patients used to develop the prediction tools, the outcome being predicted, prediction tool-specific features, predictive accuracy, and whether validation was performed. Summary Decision rules, such as nomograms, provide evidence-based and at the same time individualized predictions of the outcome of interest. Such predictions have been repeatedly shown to be more accurate than those of clinicians, regardless of their level of expertise. Accurate risk estimates are also required for clinical trial design, to ensure homogeneous high-risk patient groups for whom new cancer therapeutics will be investigated.

A comparison of the general movements assessment with traditional approaches to newborn and infant assessment: Concurrent validity	EARLY HUMAN DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						neurobehavioral assessment; preterm infant; general movements; functional motor assessment	PRETERM INFANTS; QUALITY	Background: Assessment of the quality of general movements (GMs) is an early clinical marker for prediction of cerebral palsy. Aims: To explore how the General Movements Assessment (GMsA) relates to traditional newborn and infant measures currently in use. Study design: A prospective cohort design was used to examine concurrent validity of the GMsA in Neonatal Intensive Care (NICU) survivors (n = 100) at three age points: preterm (34 weeks gestational age GA), term (38-40 weeks GA), and post term (12 weeks adjusted age [AA]) with traditional assessments (see below). Correlation analysis was used to determine the strength of the associations between tests at each age point. Subjects: Preterm infants born at <= 32 weeks gestational age and birth weight <1500 g (n = 108) were recruited sequentially from the NICU of a large teaching hospital and referral centre. Infants with diagnoses of metabolic disorders, cardiac, chromosomal, or congenital abnormalities were excluded. Outcome measures: Test of Infant Motor Performance (TIMP), Einstein Neonatal Neurobehavioral. Assessment Scale (ENNAS), Alberta Infant Motor Scales (AIMS). Results: A low-strength relationship (r=<0.25) was found between the GMsA and the traditional tests which increased across age points (r=0.25-0.50). Relationships between the traditional tests over time was characterized by stronger associations (r=0.50-0.75). Conclusions: Evidence of concurrent validity of the GMsA with traditional assessments was not found. These early findings support Prechtl's suggestion that GMs reflect a unique neurologic construct, different from traditional tests and reinforce the complementary perspective which the GMsA brings to neonatal assessment.

Identification of epileptogenic areas can be difficult and studies are needed to characterize the epileptogenic network in more detail. Methods: Five children with TSC and focal epilepsy were studied using simultaneous EEG and functional MRI recordings. Tubers were marked by a neuroradiologist on the anatomical MRI. Spike-associated BOLD (blood oxygenation level-dependent) responses were superimposed with lesions. Results: Thirteen different types of interictal epileptiform discharges (IED) were analyzed with 12 showing a BOLD response, all involving more than one tuber. Five studies had tubers with activations exclusively within the lesion, three studies had lesional activations extending to perilesional areas, and two studies had activations involving exclusively perilesional areas of at least one tuber. Deactivations exclusively within a tuber were found in six studies, lesional deactivations extending to perilesional areas were found in four studies, and tubers with exclusively perilesional deactivations were found in five studies. A BOLD response was found in at least one tuber in the lobe of IED generation and presumed seizure onset (according to telemetry) in all patients. In four patients, the same tubers were involved following different IED localizations. The observed changes were always multifocal, sometimes involving tubers distant from the IED field. Discussion: These findings suggest extended epileptogenic networks in patients with TSC, which exceed networks described in PET and SPECT studies. It was possible to identify specific interictally active tubers. EEG-fMRI provides a noninvasive method to select tubers and areas at their borders for further presurgical investigations.

Electrophysiological evidence suggests the involvement of the neocortex in periventricular nodular heterotopia (PVNH). Purpose: To determine whether alpha-MTrp PET can detect neocortical changes in patients with PVNH. Methods: Four patients (2 male, mean age 28, range 23-35 years) with PVNH and intractable seizures were studied. The functional image in each patient was compared with those from 21 healthy controls (mean age 34.6 +/- 14.2 years) by using statistical parametric mapping (SPM). The location of increased alpha-MTrp uptake was compared with the location of the EEG focus. A significant cluster was defined as a cluster with a height p = 0.005 and an extent threshold 100. Results: alpha-MTrp PET revealed increased cortical uptake in two of four patients. The area of increased alpha-MTrp uptake in one patient was widespread. In the other patient, the area of increased uptake did not include the region where most seizures were generated on EEG. alpha-MTrp PET did not show increased uptake in the heterotopic nodules in any of the patients. Conclusions: alpha-MTrp PET suggests abnormal metabolism of tryptophan in the neocortex. The increased uptake may be diffuse and may not co-localize with the EEG focus. This preliminary study suggests that alpha-MTrp PET may be useful, in conjunction with other evaluations, in localizing epileptic focus in patients with PVNH and refractory seizures.

So far, 33 different loci (SPGs) have been mapped and the 15 genes responsible have been identified. We mapped a locus responsible for a form of spastic paraplegia, complicated by bilateral cataracts, gastroesophageal reflux with persisting vomiting and amyotrophy to chromosome 10q23.3-q24.2, in an Italian family. The critical region was in a 12 cm chromosomal interval between markers D10S564 and D10S603 (SPG9, MIM601162). In the same region, two other forms of HSP have been recently mapped: SPG27 and SPG33. In the latter case, the gene responsible has been identified. Materials and methods: To better characterize this region, we genotyped individuals from SPG9-linked families using additional markers and reduced the candidate region to a 4.8 Mb, excluding several genes by positional cloning. Results: The refined SPG9 locus is positioned completely within SPG27 and does not include the SPG33 gene. Discussion: Fifty-two transcripts are present in the refined critical region and 25 strong candidates have been excluded as disease causing genes by direct sequencing. Six of them were also excluded as responsible for SPG27.

Of interest were the changes in NAcc DA transmission associated with discrepancies between the time food is expected and when it is actually presented. We used in vivo voltammetry to monitor NAcc DA levels as rats received, on the first and second test days, 30-s meals of condensed milk on a VT-52 schedule (inter-meal intervals of 32, 35, 40, 45, 52, 64, and 95 s). On the third and subsequent days meals were presented first on a VT-52 s schedule and then on an FT-52 s schedule. On day 1, monotonic increases in NAcc DA signals were observed during both meal consumption and the intervals between VT meal presentations. By day 2, however, meal presentations on the VT schedule elicited biphasic DA signal fluctuations; DA signals increased prior to each meal presentation but then started to decline during the feeding bout that followed. Fixed-time meal presentations on day 3 disrupted this pattern, resulting in a concurrent escalation of DA signal fluctuations upon subsequent VT meal presentations. These findings provide further evidence that, in trained animals, NAcc DA transmission is activated by conditioned incentive cues rather than by primary rewards. They also suggest that the increases in NAcc DA transmission associated with reward expectancy are sensitive to temporal cues (e.g. interval timing) and to discrepancies between expected and actual outcomes.

Aim: To assess the effectiveness of beta interferon (beta IFN) in preventing the first attack and severe disability after confirmed MS diagnosis in a pediatric cohort. Methods: A cohort of 197 relapsing-remitting pediatric MS patients was studied (19902005). Patients were followed from MS diagnosis until the first subsequent attack or severe disability occurrence (DSS score of >= 4) or were censored. The Cox model, with time-dependent beta IFN exposure to account for the varying times of starting this treatment, was used to estimate the effect of beta IFN on the risk of this attack or severe disability, adjusting for potential confounding factors. Results: During cohort follow-up (mean 5.5 years), 70.5% of the 197 children had a first attack (80% within the first 2 years) and 24 started beta IFN (mean delay 3.6 months; mean duration 17.1 months). The use of beta IFN was associated with a significant reduction in the rate of the first attack during the first year of treatment (hazard ratio: 0.31, 95% confidence interval: 0.13-0.72) as well as the first 2 years (0.40, 0.20-0.83). This effect was less significant over the entire follow-up of up to 4 years of treatment (0.57, 0.30-1.10). The use of beta IFN suggests a reduction on the occurrence of severe disability, although not statistically significant (HR 0.78; 95% CI: 0.25-2.42). Conclusions: The use of beta IFN, given after the diagnosis of MS, significantly reduces the risk of relapse during the first 2 years. (C) 2007 European Paediatric Neurology Society.

Eleven CB without a history of visual perception were compared with 21 age- and sex-matched normal-sighted controls (NS). CB showed significant atrophy of the geniculo-striate system, encompassing the optic nerves, the optic chiasm, the optic radiations and the primary visual cortex (BA17). The volume decrease in BA17 reached 25% in both hemispheres. The pulvinar and its projections to the associative visual areas were also dramatically altered, BA18/19 and the middle temporal cortex (MT) showing volume reductions of up to 20%. Additional significant white matter alterations were observed in the inferior longitudinal tract and in the posterior part of the corpus callosum, which links the visual areas of both hemispheres. Our data indicate that the afferent projections to the visual cortex in CB are largely atrophied. Despite the massive volume reductions in the occipital lobes, there is compelling evidence from the literature (reviewed in Noppeney 2007; Ptito and Kupers 2005) that blind subjects activate their visual cortex when performing tasks that involve somatosensory or auditory inputs, suggesting a reorganization of the neural pathways that transmit sensory information to the visual cortex.

Depth electrode recordings show double dissociation between pitch processing in lateral Heschl's gyrus and sound onset processing in medial Heschl's gyrus	EXPERIMENTAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						pitch; auditory cortex; human; auditory evoked potentials	HUMAN AUDITORY-CORTEX; ITERATED RIPPLED NOISE; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; TEMPORAL DYNAMICS; CORTICAL AREAS; COMPLEX TONES; PERCEPTION; STRENGTH; MODEL; ORGANIZATION	Pitch is a fundamental perceptual attribute of sounds. Our ability to discriminate, separate, and identify sounds relies heavily on pitch. Recent neuroimaging studies in humans have provided converging evidence for the existence of a "pitch center" region on the superior temporal plane (STP) lateral to Heschl's gyrus specialized in pitch extraction-but a direct confirmation is still missing. Intracerebral recordings in humans are ideally suited for such a confirmation. Here we report results from depth electrode recordings in a patient undergoing investigation for epilepsy. We demonstrate a double dissociation between responses from the medial and lateral STP around Heschl's gyrus to the onset of sound energy and the onset of pitch. Three pieces of evidence support this finding: (1) the response to sounds that do not contain pitch is small in the lateral STP compared to the medial STP; (2) sounds that contain pitch evoke a strong response in the lateral STP; (3) at the transition from noise to a specialised noise-like, but tonal, sound referred to as iterated ripple noise, where the onset of pitch is the sole acoustic event, only the lateral contact showed a response. Our results provide direct evidence for a pitch-specific area on lateral STP with intracranial recordings from the human auditory cortex.

There is an emerging diversity of algogenic mechanisms suggesting heterogeneity in pain aetiology in the OA patient population. Objective/methods: This review article summarises key issues in existing therapies for OA pain and highlights the emerging compounds in early and late development. It also highlights where tolerability may be a concern, especially in the older populations in which treatment interactions for co-morbid conditions may further narrow therapeutic index. importantly, the authors also examine the diversity of biology that underpins OA pain and highlight the opportunities for the future. Results/conclusions: Many emerging therapies are presently in proof-of-concept clinical testing for treatment of OA. A growing understanding of the heterogeneity in the OA patient population, will challenge the ability to accurately understand observed efficacy or safety signals in these relatively small trials and how they may titrate to a broader patient population. We may need to wait several more years to understand whether the need for a differentiated therapy demanded by patients, payors and physicians alike, will be met.

Methods: A comprehensive MEDLINE and PUBMED search was utilized to investigate current novel mechanistic approaches in treating erectile dysfunction. Search criteria included, but were not limited to, erectile dysfunction (ED), cGMP, nitric oxide, Rho-kinase, phosphodiesterase, gene therapy, apomorphine, melanocortin and corpora cavernosa. Articles relating to in vitro, animal and in vivo experimental therapy were evaluated and included in this review and future directions are described. Results: Current first-line ED treatment often involves the use of phosphodiesterase inhibitors. However, many novel pharmacotherapeutic approaches under development including the use of melanocortins and Rho-kinase inhibitors as well as the introduction of gene therapy have demonstrated efficacy in animal as well as early human trials. Conclusions: The success of oral pharmacotherapy for ED has been accompanied by renewed interest into the ED pathophysiology and signal transduction pathways. This has led to the identification of new therapeutic targets, which are poised to change the dynamic of ED management by broadening treatment alternatives to include other oral and genetic therapies.

The overall cure rate of 40% is unsatisfactory and new therapeutic strategies are urgently needed. AKT is a major mediator of survival signals that protect cells from apoptosis and regulate cell proliferation. The AKT signaling network is considered a key determinant of the biological aggressiveness of these tumors. In this article, the authors discuss the relation between activators of AKT in neuroblastoma, in particular, growth factors such as IGF-1, TRK, GDNF, VEGF and EGF, and their effects on tumoral proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. Numerous other proteins interact with AKT in neuroblastoma. Several are relatively well characterized, such as PTEN and retinoic acid; others are new and potentially interesting, such as PKC and anaplastic lymphoma kinase. Specific inhibition of AKT has been studied, such as with LY249002, with significant effects on cell progression and apoptosis in tumoral cells. Moreover, a series of new drugs, such as geldanamycin and rapamycin, directly modify the expression of AKT in tumoral cells. Few specific inhibitors of AKT are available; less specific inhibitors are probably unsuitable therapeutic options in neuroblastoma. Drugs with a direct or indirect inhibitory effect on the AKT pathway, used alone or in combination with other drugs, seem to hold great promise as a new therapeutic modality in neuroblastoma.

Understanding the aggregation mechanisms is a fundamental step in order to design rational drugs interfering with the toxic intermediates. This self-assembly process is however difficult to observe experimentally, which gives simulations an important role in resolving this problem. This study shows how we can proceed to gain knowledge about the first steps of aggregation. We first start by characterizing the free energy surface of the Abeta (16-22) dimer, a well-studied system numerically, using molecular dynamics simulations with OPEP coarse-grained force field. We then turn to the study of the NHVTLSQ peptide in 4-mers and 16-mers, extracting information on the onset of aggregation. In particular, the simulations indicate that the peptides are mostly random coil at room temperature, but can visit diverse amyloid-competent topologies, albeit with a low probability. The fact that the 16-mers constantly move from one structure to another is consistent with the long lag phase measured experimentally, but the rare critical steps leading to the rapid formation of amyloid fibrils still remain to be determined.

It causes urine to flow backward from the bladder to the ureter due to a developmental defect at the vesicoureteral junction, whose formation requires rearrangement during transformation (Ret)-mediated signaling pathways. To study the genetic causes of pVUR in Quebec patients, we used a sequencing-based candidate gene approach to screen the RET gene and found that 83 out of 118 pVUR patients are carriers of the rare A allele of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs1799939:G>A that results in a Gly691Ser mutation, a statistically significant increase in allelic frequency, that is absent at six flanking RET SNPs tested. Ser691 is a predicted phosphorylation site and our analysis of transfected cells showed that the Gly691Ser Ret mutant can efficiently interact and associate with a 75-80-kD tyrosine phosphorylated cellular protein, an event not seen with wild-type Ret. This interaction and/or the steric or electric hindrance created by phospho Ser691 may interfere with the known regulatory functions of the normally phosphorylated phospho-Tyr687 and phospho-Ser696 on the cytoskeleton actin reorganization that are responsible for cell motility and morphology, which consequently may lead to the deficiency in ureteral development observed in pVUR. Our study demonstrates that the Ret Gly691Ser mutation is associated with pVUR and may be one of the genetic causes of this condition in the French-Canadian population in Quebec.

The aim of this study was to examine the cost-effectiveness of vaccination against HZ and PHN in Canada. A cohort model was developed to estimate the burden of HZ and the cost-effectiveness of HZ vaccination, using Canadian population-based data. Different ages at vaccination were examined and probabilistic sensitivity analysis was performed. The economic evaluation was conducted from the ministry of health perspective and 5% discounting was used for costs and benefits. In Canada (population = 30 million), we estimate that each year there are 130,000 new cases of HZ, 17,000 cases of PHN and 20 deaths. Most of the pain and suffering is borne by adults over the age of 60 years and is due to PHN. Vaccinating 65-year-olds (HZ efficacy = 63%, PHN efficacy = 67%, no waning, cost/course = $ 150) is estimated to cost $ 33,000 per QALY-gained (90% CrI: 19,000 63,000). Assuming the cost per course of HZ vaccination is $ 150, probabilistic sensitivity analysis suggest that vaccinating between 65 and 75 years of age will likely yield cost-effectiveness ratios below $ 40,000 per Quality-Adjusted Life-Year (QALY) gained, while vaccinating adults older than 75 years will yield ratios less than $ 70,000 per QALY-gained. These results are most sensitive to the duration of vaccine protection and the cost of vaccination. In conclusion, results suggest that vaccinating adults between the ages of 65 and 75 years is likely to be cost-effective and thus to be a judicious use of scarce health care resources.

The function of p38 in myelination has only been recently addressed. Using pyridinyl imidazole-based p38 alpha/beta selective inhibitors, we have reported a critical role for this kinase in the regulation of myelination, specifically, in controlling the differentiation of Schwann cells, and oligodendrocytes, the myelinating glia of the peripheral and central nervous systems, respectively. These compounds inhibited the accumulation of myelin-cell-specific markers, including myelin-specific glycosphingolipids, myelin-associated glycoprotein, and myelin basic protein. More significantly, myelination of dorsal root ganglia neurons by oligodendrocytes was irreversibly blocked by p38 inhibitors. Our current studies are focusing on the molecular mechanisms by which p38 regulates oligodendrocyte and Schwann cell differentiation and its role in models of myelination and remyelination.

The reasons why one of the patient's languages may be more affected than others is investigated. Whether a particular language should be used in psychotherapy, and if so, which one, is also explored. The need for bilingual health professionals and the advantages and disadvantages of using interpreters are assessed. Different aspects of biculturalism (as distinct from bilingualism) and their various implications are examined. The possible effects of age and manner of second language appropriation are discussed. Differential symptoms in bilingual individuals with Huntington's, Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases are briefly reviewed. Parallels between bilingual aphasia and symptoms of psychoses and dementia are outlined. These various phenomena are considered within the framework of a neurolinguistic theory of bilingualism.

Human updating of visual motion direction during head rotations	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article							SACCADIC EYE-MOVEMENTS; SUPERIOR TEMPORAL AREA; MONKEYS MACACA-FASCICULARIS; POSTERIOR PARIETAL CORTEX; EXTRASTRIATE CORTEX; REFERENCE FRAMES; INTRACORTICAL MICROSTIMULATION; SPATIALLY ACCURATE; SPEED COMPENSATION; VESTIBULAR CORTEX	Previous studies have demonstrated that human subjects update the location of visual targets for saccades after head and body movements and in the absence of visual feedback. This phenomenon is known as spatial updating. Here we investigated whether a similar mechanism exists for the perception of motion direction. We recorded eye positions in three dimensions and behavioral responses in seven subjects during a motion task in two different conditions: when the subject's head remained stationary and when subjects rotated their heads around an anteroposterior axis (head tilt). We demonstrated that after head-tilt subjects updated the direction of saccades made in the perceived stimulus direction (direction of motion updating), the amount of updating varied across subjects and stimulus directions, the amount of motion direction updating was highly correlated with the amount of spatial updating during a memory-guided saccade task, subjects updated the stimulus direction during a two-alternative forced-choice direction discrimination task in the absence of saccadic eye movements (perceptual updating), perceptual updating was more accurate than motion direction updating involving saccades, and subjects updated motion direction similarly during active and passive head rotation. These results demonstrate the existence of an updating mechanism for the perception of motion direction in the human brain that operates during active and passive head rotations and that resembles the one of spatial updating. Such a mechanism operates during different tasks involving different motor and perceptual skills (saccade and motion direction discrimination) with different degrees of accuracy.

The brain stem saccadic burst generator encodes gaze in three-dimensional space	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article							VERGENCE EYE-MOVEMENTS; HORIZONTAL VESTIBULOOCULAR REFLEX; SYSTEM-IDENTIFICATION TECHNIQUES; PONTINE RETICULAR-FORMATION; MONKEY SUPERIOR COLLICULUS; ALERT SQUIRREL-MONKEY; NEURAL CONTROL; VOLUNTARY CANCELLATION; QUANTITATIVE-ANALYSIS; DISJUNCTIVE SACCADES	When we look between objects located at different depths the horizontal movement of each eye is different from that of the other, yet temporally synchronized. Traditionally, a vergence-specific neuronal subsystem, independent from other oculomotor subsystems, has been thought to generate all eye movements in depth. However, recent studies have challenged this view by unmasking interactions between vergence and saccadic eye movements during disconjugate saccades. Here, we combined experimental and modeling approaches to address whether the premotor command to generate disconjugate saccades originates exclusively in " vergence centers." We found that the brain stem burst generator, which is commonly assumed to drive only the conjugate component of eye movements, carries substantial vergence-related information during disconjugate saccades. Notably, facilitated vergence velocities during disconjugate saccades were synchronized with the burst onset of excitatory and inhibitory brain stem saccadic burst neurons (SBNs). Furthermore, the time-varying discharge properties of the majority of SBNs (> 70%) preferentially encoded the dynamics of an individual eye during disconjugate saccades. When these experimental results were implemented into a computer-based simulation, to further evaluate the contribution of the saccadic burst generator in generating disconjugate saccades, we found that it carries all the vergence drive that is necessary to shape the activity of the abducens motoneurons to which it projects. Taken together, our results provide evidence that the premotor commands from the brain stem saccadic circuitry, to the target motoneurons, are sufficient to ensure the accurate control shifts of gaze in three dimensions.

Sympathetic vasoconstrictor antagonism and vasodilatation relieve mechanical allodynia in rats with chronic postischemia pain	JOURNAL OF PAIN			English	Article						complex regional pain syndrome; ischemia-reperfusion injury; neuropathic pain; allodynia; sympathetic block; adrenergic receptors	COMPLEX REGIONAL PAIN; DORSAL-ROOT GANGLION; PERIPHERAL-NERVE INJURY; SYNDROME-TYPE-I; CHRONIC CONSTRICTION INJURY; NO-REFLOW PHENOMENON; SKIN BLOOD-FLOW; NEUROPATHIC PAIN; SKELETAL-MUSCLE; NITRIC-OXIDE	Chronic pain that responds to antisympathetic treatments and a-adrenergic antagonists is clinically referred to as sympathetically maintained pain. Animal models of neuropathic pain have shown mixed results in terms of antinociceptive effectiveness of antisympathetic agents. The effectiveness of these agents have not been yet investigated in animal models of complex regional pain syndrome-type 1 (CRPS-I). In this study, we examined the effectiveness of antisympathetic agents and sympathetic vasoconstrictor antagonists, as well as agents that are vasoclilators, in relieving mechanical allodynia in a recently developed animal model of CRPS-I (chronic postischemia pain or CPIP) produced by 3 hours of hind paw ischemia-reperfusion injury. Systemic guanethidine, phentolamine, clonidine, and prazosin are effective in reducing mechanical allodynia particularly at 2 days after reperfusion, and less so at 7 days after reperfusion. A nitric oxide donor vasoclilator, SIN-1, also reduces mechanical allodynia more effectively at 2 days after reperfusion, but not at 7 days after reperfusion. These results suggest that the pain of CPIP, and possibly also CRPS-I, is relieved by reducing sympathetically mediated vasoconstriction, or enhancing vasodilatation. Perspective: The results of this study indicate that sympathetic block, or administration of a,adrenergic antagonists, clonidine, or a nitric oxide donor, relieve allodynia in an animal model of CRPS-L Thus, the pain of CRPS-l may depend on enhanced vasoconstrictor responsiveness, which may be relieved by blocking sympathetic efferent-dependent vasoconstriction, or by enhancing nitric oxide-dependent vasodilatation.

The purpose of our study is to review our 20-year experience with diaphragmatic pacing as a treatment modality for CCAHS. Methods: After obtaining institutional review board approval, the medical records of all 6 patients who currently are in the diaphragmatic pacing program at the Montreal Children's Hospital, Montreal, QC, Canada were reviewed. In addition to demographic details, associated anomalies were noted. Data regarding age at surgery, technical approach, and short- and long-term complications, including equipment failure and replacement, were noted. We were interested in the long-term outcome for this group of patients, particularly their quality of life. Results: Our group of patients is composed of 4 females and 2 males. Their age ranges between 4 and 23 years. They were operated on at an average age of 47.8 months. The surgical approach used was mainly bilateral axillary thoracotomy. Internal component failure is the most common complication. All patients are ventilator free during the day. They all are active and productive, either attending school or working full time. Conclusion: Diaphragmatic pacing is an effective treatment of Ondine disease. As equipment improved, there is much less need for replacement of components. Patients can lead a much more normal existence by being ventilator free at least during the day, enabling them to participate in normal daily activities. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

First, integration time, which corresponds to the time it takes for a neuron to reach threshold when stimulated at the minimum effective intensity, was found to be significantly shorter at high-carrier frequency than at low-carrier frequency. Second, phase locking to sinusoidally amplitude modulated signals was more efficient at high frequency, especially at high modulation rates and low modulation depths. Finally, we examined the efficiency with which ON1 detects gaps in a constant tone. As reflected by the decrease in firing rate in the vicinity of the gap, ON I is better at detecting gaps at low-carrier frequency. Following a gap, firing rate increases beyond the pre-gap level. This "rebound" phenomenon is similar for low- and high-carrier frequencies. (c) 2008 Acoustical Socieoty of America.

In neurons, it is present in cell bodies and also in RNA granules which are transported along dendrites. Dendritic mRNA localization might be involved in long-term synaptic plasticity and memory. To determine the role of Stau1 in synaptic function, we examined the effects of Stau1 down-regulation in hippocampal slice cultures using small interfering RNA (siRNA). Biolistic transfection of Stau1 siRNA resulted in selective down-regulation of Stau1 in slice cultures. Consistent with a role of Stau1 in transporting mRNAs required for synaptic plasticity, Stau1 down-regulation impaired the late form of chemically induced long-term potentiation (L-LTP) without affecting early-LTP, mGluR1/5-mediated long-term depression, or basal evoked synaptic transmission. Stau1 down-regulation decreased the amplitude and frequency of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents, suggesting a role in maintaining efficacy at hippocampal synapses. At the cellular level, Stau1 down-regulation shifted spine shape from regular to elongated spines, without changes in spine density. The change in spine shape could be rescued by an RNA interference-resistant Stau1 isoform. Therefore, Stau1 is important for processing and/or transporting in dendrites mRNAs that are critical in regulation of synaptic strength and maintenance of functional connectivity changes underlying hippocampus-dependent learning and memory.

The resulting accumulation of CoA esters and reduction of acetyl-CoA and free CoA (CoASH) will then trigger a cascade of reactions leading to clinical disease. Most conditions detected by expanded neonatal screening are CASTOR diseases. We review acyl-CoA metabolism, including CoASH synthesis, transesterification of acyl-CoAs to glycine, glutamate or L-carnitine and hydrolysis of CoA esters. Because acyl-CoAs do not cross biological membranes, their main toxicity is intracellular, primarily within mitochondria. Treatment measures directed towards removal of circulating metabolites do not address this central problem of intracellular acyl-CoA accumulation. Treatments usually involve the restriction of dietary precursors and administration of agents like L-carnitine and glycine, which can accept the transfer of acyl groups from acyl-CoA, liberating CoASH. Many hereditary CASTOR patients are chronically ill, with persistent symptoms and continuously abnormal metabolites in blood and urine despite good compliance with treatment. Conversely, asymptomatic patients are also common in hereditary CASTOR conditions. Future challenges include the understanding of pathophysiologic mechanisms in CASTOR diseases, the discovery of reliable predictors of outcome in individual patients and the establishment of therapeutic trials with sufficient numbers of patients to permit solid therapeutic conclusions.

Within each tumour only a small percentage of glioma cells may actually express EGFRvIII; however, most of the cells exhibit a transformed phenotype(1). Here we show that EGFRvIII can be 'shared' between glioma cells by intercellular transfer of membrane-derived microvesicles ('oncosomes'). EGFRvIII expression in indolent glioma cells stimulates formation of lipid-raft related microvesicles containing EGFRvIII. Microvesicles containing this receptor are then released to cellular surroundings and blood of tumour-bearing mice, and can merge with the plasma membranes of cancer cells lacking EGFRvIII. This event leads to the transfer of oncogenic activity, including activation of transforming signalling pathways ( MAPK and Akt), changes in expression of EGFRvIII-regulated genes (VEGF, Bcl- x(L), p27), morphological transformation and increase in anchorage-independent growth capacity. Thus, membrane microvesicles of cancer cells can contribute to a horizontal propagation of oncogenes and their associated transforming phenotype among subsets of cancer cells.

In particular, it is not known how early in the course of the disease olfactory deficits occur, and whether they are restricted to identification or involve other aspects of olfaction. We studied olfactory (odor detection thresholds, quality discrimination, and identification) and cognitive (attention, reasoning, memory, naming and fluency) functioning in patients with AD, with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and in normal elderly control (NEC) participants. MCI patients were impaired in olfactory sensitivity and identification, while a discrimination deficit was accounted for by abnormal thresholds. AD patients were impaired in all three domains, and were worse than the MCI group. Odor discrimination (OD) and identification performance correlated more prominently than detection thresholds with performance on neuropsychological tests. We concluded that deficits in olfactory detection thresholds and identification occur early in AD, before clinical symptoms are fully developed, and decline further over the course of the disease. High detection thresholds, together with impaired identification, may be useful as an early indicator of AD. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Classification images reveal the information sensitivity of brain voxels in fMRI	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							FACIAL EXPRESSIONS; DISTORTION CORRECTION; HUMAN AMYGDALA; FACE; FEARFUL; RECOGNITION; PERCEPTION; STRATEGIES; RESPONSES; CORTEX	Reverse correlation methods have been widely used in neuroscience for many years and have recently been applied to study the sensitivity of human brain signals ( EEG, MEG) to complex visual stimuli. Here we employ one such method, Bubbles (Gosselin, F., Schyns, P. G., 2001. Bubbles: A technique to reveal the use of information in recognition tasks. Vis. Res. 41, 2261-2271), in conjunction with fMRI in the context of a 3AFC facial expression categorization task. We highlight the regions of the brain showing significant sensitivity with respect to the critical visual information required to perform the categorization judgments. Moreover, we reveal the actual subset of visual information which modulates BOLD sensitivity within each such brain region. Finally, we show the potential which lies within analyzing brain function in terms of the information states of different brain regions. Thus, we can now analyse human brain function in terms of the specific visual information different brain regions process. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Experience-dependent neural substrates involved in vocal pitch regulation during singing	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						audio-vocal integration; auditory feedback; fMRI; musicians; pitch shift; singers	ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; HUMAN CEREBRAL-CORTEX; EVENT-RELATED FMRI; OLD-WORLD MONKEY; AUDITORY-CORTEX; HUMAN BRAIN; SPEECH PRODUCTION; FUNCTIONAL-ORGANIZATION; SENSORIMOTOR ADAPTATION; MOTOR INTERACTION	Proper singing requires the integration of auditory feedback mechanisms with the vocal motor system, such that vocal pitch can be precisely controlled. To determine the neural substrates involved in audio-vocal integration, non-musicians and experienced singers underwent fMRI scanning while they sang a single tone with either unaltered ("simple") or pitch-shifted auditory feedback; in pitch-shifted trials, subjects were instructed either to ignore or compensate for the shifted feedback. We hypothesized that the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), superior temporal gyrus (STG), and anterior insula may be involved in audio-vocal integration due to their functional roles during singing and their anatomical connectivity. Although singers were more accurate than non-musicians in simple singing, both groups recruited similar functional networks. Singers ignored the shifted feedback better than non-musicians, and both groups also displayed different patterns of neural activity for this task: singers recruited bilateral auditory areas and left putamen, while non-musicians recruited the left supramarginal gyrus and primary motor cortex. While there were no significant group differences in performing the compensate task, singers displayed enhanced activity in the ACC, superior temporal sulcus, and putamen, whereas non-musicians exhibited increased activity in the dorsal premotor cortex, a region involved with sensorimotor interactions. We propose two neural substrates for audio-vocal integration: the dorsal premotor cortex may act as a basic interface, but with vocal training and practice, the ACC, auditory cortices, and putamen may be increasingly recruited as people learn to monitor their auditory feedback and adjust their vocal output accordingly.

Stroke can lead to restrictions in participation in daily activities and social roles. Although considered an important rehabilitation outcome, little is known about participation after stroke and its predictors, and about the differences associated with the types of services provided following stroke. Objective. The aims of this study were 1) to follow and compare changes in participation of older adults discharged home after stroke from acute care or postacute rehabilitation, and 2) to identify the best predictors of participation after stroke from physical, cognitive, perceptual, and psychological ability measures taken shortly after discharge. Methods. Level of participation in daily activities and social roles of 197 older adults who had a stroke was evaluated at 2 to 3 weeks (T1), 3 months (T2), and 6 months (T3) after being discharged home from acute care (n = 86) or rehabilitation (n = 111). Physical, cognitive, perceptual, and psychological abilities were assessed at T1. Results. A significant increase in participation was found over time for both groups, mainly in the first 3 months. The best predictors of participation differed between the groups and between the daily activities and social roles domains. Walking and acceptance of the stroke or fewer depressive symptoms were the best predictors of the level of participation after stroke. Conclusions. Participation was not optimal at discharge because it continued to increase after the return home. The importance of psychological factors in participation after stroke is undeniable. Many predictors are amenable to interventions.

DSP-4 treatment of rats on the first and third day after birth produces a long-lasting lesion of noradrenergic neurons in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). In DSP-4-lesioned rats, studied as adults, we observed a decrease in norepinephrine content, with no significant change in the levels of dopamine, 5-hydroxytryptamine,andy-aminobutyric acid (GABA). There is now a well established interaction between noradrenergic and GABAergic systems, whereby the noradrenergic system is involved in the regulation of basal GABA release, while GABAergic neurons simultaneously exert tonic inhibitory regulation of LC norepinephrine neurons. We examined GABAergic neurotransmission in the norepinephrine-denervated PFC for a better appreciation of the interaction between these two systems. Treatment with the GABA transaminase inhibitor vigabatrine (VGB) increased the GABA level of PFC (tissue content) in both intact and lesioned groups. Additionally, VGB increased extracellular GABA concentration in the PFC in both control and DSP-4-lesioned animals, but the elevation of GABA was 2-fold higher in DSP-4 lesioned rats. These findings indicate that neonatal DSP-4 treatment increases GABAergic neurotransmission in the PFC of rats in adulthood, perhaps by decreasing reactivity of central GABAA receptors.

In this study we test the hypothesis that empathy-evoked activation in the pain network leads to heightened pain perception. After inducing in half of our subjects a state of high empathy for an actor and in the other half a state of low empathy towards him, we measured the sensitivity to heat stimuli of various intensities in healthy participants while they watched the actor being exposed to similar stimuli. Participants in the "high-empathy" group rated painful (but not non-painful) stimuli applied to themselves as more intense and unpleasant than did those in the "low-empathy" group. Positive correlations between state empathy scores and pain ratings further suggest that this perceptual phenomenon depends on the magnitude of empathic response induced in the participants. The effects were observed when subjects watched the model receiving either neutral or painful stimuli, suggesting that it is empathy itself that alters pain perception, and not necessarily the observation of pain behaviors.

Methods: Databases (Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, MedLine, and EMBASE) were searched for RCTs that evaluated treatment of migraine in children (<18 years of age). Guidelines published on the subject were checked for missed references. Characteristics of the identified studies as well as primary outcome (headache relief), other recognized primary outcomes, and adverse events were abstracted. Quality of the RCTs was evaluated using the Jadad score. Results: Of the 14 trials included in the review, only I was performed in an ED after other treatments have failed. In that situation, prochlorperazine was more effective than ketorolac in relieving pain at 1 hour. Other treatments were evaluated by neurologists on their outpatients who started the studied drugs early at the beginning of the migraine without previous treatment. In that situation, ibuprofen (n = 3) and acetaminophen (n = 1) were better than placebo for pain relief The efficacy of intranasal sumatriptan (n = 4), oral rizatriptan (n = 3), and oral zolmitriptan (n = 2) for pain relief was unclear. Oral sumatriptan (n = 1) and oral dihydroergotamine (n = 1) were not effective. Conclusions: There is a lack of studies addressing the question of treatment in the ED for children experiencing migraine. Although other treatments were found effective in children with migraine, none was evaluated in the ED except prochlorperazine and ketorolac.

Legal and ethical standards require resuscitation when it is considered to be in the patient's best interest. We hypothesized that newborn infants might be dealt with according to different standards, compared with older patients. METHODS. An anonymous questionnaire describing 8 currently incompetent patients with potential neurologic sequelae who required resuscitation was administered to groups of physicians and students. Survival and morbidity rates were explicitly described; a very preterm infant, a full term infant and a 2-month-old infant had identical outcomes. Two patients, a 7-month-old infant and an 80-year-old patient, were previously significantly impaired. Respondents were asked whether resuscitation was in the patient's best interest and whether they would comply with the families' wishes if resuscitation was refused. RESULTS. There was an 85% response rate ( n = 524). The largest proportions of respondents stated that it was in the best interests of the 2-month-old infant and the 7-year-old child to be resuscitated ( 97% and 94%, respectively), followed by the 50-year-old patient and the term infant ( 87%), the 2 patients with 5% chance of survival ( 76% and 80%), the premature infant ( 69%), and finally the 80-year-old patient ( 32%). Approximately one fifth of the respondents who thought that it was in a patient's best interests to be resuscitated would nevertheless accept the family's refusal of resuscitation for all scenarios except the 80-year-old patient ( 72% acceptance) and the preterm infant ( 54% acceptance). CONCLUSIONS. Whether resuscitation is considered in a patient's best interests is not closely related to survival rates or disability. Newborn infants and particularly preterm infants are systematically devalued, in comparison with older patients whose outcomes are the same or worse. Accepting a family's refusal of resuscitation, even among respondents who thought that resuscitation was in the patient's best interest, was much more common for the newborns.

This view begs the question: what kinds of computations are possible? We show that different parameterizations of a simple chemical kinetic model of transcriptional regulation are able to approximate all four standard arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, as well as various equality and inequality operations. This contrasts with other studies that emphasize logical or digital notions of computation in biological networks. We analyze the accuracy and precision of these approximations, showing that they depend on different sets of parameters, and are thus independently tunable. We demonstrate that networks of these "arithmetic'' genes can be combined to accomplish yet more complicated computations by designing and simulating a network that detects statistically significant elevations in a time-varying signal. We also consider the much more general problem of approximating analytic functions, showing that this can be achieved by allowing multiple transcription factor binding sites on the promoter. These observations are important for the interpretation of naturally occurring networks and imply new possibilities for the design of synthetic networks.

Methods A response-shift model was developed using data from a longitudinal study of stroke in which measures of stroke impact were made at study entry and at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months post stroke. Residuals from a random effects model were centered and used to create trajectories. This model was tested against a data set from a study in which the then-test had been administered. Twenty simulated data sets were also generated to examine how much of response shift could be attributed to random error. Results Group-based trajectory analysis identified seven trajectory groups. The majority (67%) of the 387 persons showed no response shift over time, whereas 15% lowered and 13% raised their health over time, disproportionally to that predicted. Conclusion Results of the validation studies were supportive that this methodology identifies response shift, but further research is required to compare results with other methodologies and other predictive models.

Communication, language and the brain: from past anterior to near future	REVUE NEUROLOGIQUE			French	Article						brain; language; communication; aphasia; history	RIGHT-HEMISPHERE DAMAGE; APHASIA	The goat of this article is to share some reflection on the astonishing evolution of the ideas in communication neuroscience and neurolinguistics over the last 30 years, since the founding of the societe de neuropsychologie de langue francaise. in particular, a number of conceptual and methodological advancements have characterized this period, many of which have been lead or heavily contributed by french-speaking research groups in that field. among the advances discussed, are (a) the widening to discourse and pragmatic components of the concept of language, as well as the theoretical and clinical implication of this conceptual extension, (b) the unique contribution of anatomical and functional neuroimaging, (c) the massive impact of the cognitive revolution on theoretical frameworks of language components, and its influence on therapy, (d) the disappearance and the re-appearance of the brain in the main stream research on language over this period, (e) the new perspectives offered though attention put on social aspects of language and the social participation of the individual with language disorders, (f) the emergence of a genuine science of aphasia rehabilitation, and (g) the rediscovery of inter-individual characteristics both genetically- and environmentally-determined. The authors then risk themselves in trying to envision what could characterize the evolution in the field for the next 30 years. Though perilous, this speculative exercise allowed to pinpoint to a number of anticipated advancements including (a) a probable reconciliation between cognitive and connectionist models to the benefit of both visions, (b) an increased contribution of social and emotional neurosciences, (c) some inescapable technological advancements, including tight portable neuroimaging devices which will allow to study the neurobiological bases of communication in natural contexts, (d) the integration between communication and aging in cognitive neuroscience and (e) the development of new research fields at some unexpected cross-roads (e.g., physical activity and communication ?) as wet[ as the description of new types of aphasia (e.g., towards a chat aphasia !). Taken together, the advancements made over the 30 last years, and the perspective of future development, confirms the premier role of cognitive neuroscience of language and neurolinguistics in setting the pace through innovative approaches that allow unveiling the mysteries of the mutual relationships between brain and cognition.

Animal models and emerging clinical data indicate that there is a complex spectrum of neurologic changes, manifesting both nociceptive and neuropathic pain, which are driven by joint pathophysiology and abnormal excitability in peripheral and central pain pathways. A variety of mechanisms and molecular drivers have been identified that can support future segmentation of musculoskeletal pain patients. Emerging therapies are directed to targeting inflammatory mediators, ligand and voltage regulated ion channels, as well as increasing inhibition through monoaminergic modulation. Finally, neurotrophic abnormalities may be restored through the modulation of specific neurotrophins. These developments are supported by increasing emphasis on the clinical understanding of the neurologic changes in pain patients to enable confident translation to clinical application.

Recent studies indicate that NgR is also expressed in nonneuronal cells and modulates macrophage responses during inflammation after peripheral nerve injury. In this article, we discuss the possibility that NgR might have wider effects on inflammation in a variety of neurological conditions ranging from central nervous system trauma to diseases such as multiple sclerosis or Alzheimer's disease.

Plaid perception is only subtly impaired in strabismic amblyopia	VISION RESEARCH			English	Article						amblyopia; plaids; global motion; transparent motion; MT; strabismus; multiple apertures	VISUAL AREA MT; MOTION PERCEPTION; MACAQUE MONKEYS; COHERENT MOTION; PATTERNS; CONTRAST; DEFICIT; INTEGRATION; CORTEX; PSYCHOPHYSICS	Amblyopes exhibit a global motion anomaly that implicates processing beyond the local motion analysis of V1 possibly involving areas MT and MST in the extra-striate cortex. Here, we sought to further investigate this deficit by measuring the perception of moving plaid stimuli by amblyopic observers, since there is good physiological evidence that the motion of such stimuli is determined by processes beyond V1. The conditions under which the two moving components constituting the plaids were seen to cohere or move transparently over one another were investigated by manipulating their relative spatial frequencies. Percepts were measured using both short presentation durations, where both the percept and the direction of motion were reported, and long presentation durations where the bi-stability of the stimulus was directly measured. In addition, we measured the ability of amblyopic eyes to perceive globally coherent motion in a multiple aperture stimulus. We found a small increased tendency for both amblyopic and fellow-fixing eyes to perceive short duration plaid stimuli as coherent relative to control eyes, but no difference for long duration plaids. In addition, amblyopic eyes saw less coherence in multiple aperture stimuli than fellow-fixing eyes but were not reliably different from control eyes. We therefore conclude that the neural mechanisms underlying plaid perception are only subtly abnormal in amblyopia. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, alterations in coordinated patterns of structural brain networks in AD are still poorly understood. Here, we used cortical thickness measurement from magnetic resonance imaging to investigate large-scale structural brain networks in 92 AD patients and 97 normal controls. Brain networks were constructed by thresholding cortical thickness correlation matrices of 54 regions and analyzed using graph theoretical approaches. Compared with controls, AD patients showed decreased cortical thickness intercorrelations between the bilateral parietal regions and increased intercorrelations in several selective regions involving the lateral temporal and parietal cortex as well as the cingulate and medial frontal cortex regions. Specially, AD patients showed abnormal small-world architecture in the structural cortical networks (increased clustering and shortest paths linking individual regions), implying a less optimal topological organization in AD. Moreover, AD patients were associated with reduced nodal centrality predominantly in the temporal and parietal heteromodal association cortex regions and increased nodal centrality in the occipital cortex regions. Finally, the brain networks of AD were about equally as robust to random failures as those of controls, but more vulnerable against targeted attacks, presumably because of the effects of pathological topological organization. Our findings suggest that the coordinated patterns of cortical morphology are widely altered in AD patients, thus providing structural evidence for disrupted integrity in large-scale brain networks that underlie cognition. This work has implications for our understanding of how functional deficits in patients are associated with their underlying structural (morphological) basis.

It is shown here that the transcription factor AML1/Runx1 (Runx1) is expressed in selected spinal motor neuron subtypes after the onset of differentiation and is both necessary and sufficient to suppress interneuron-specific developmental programs and promote maintenance of motor neuron characteristics. These findings show an important role for Runx1 during the consolidation of selected spinal motor neuron identities. Moreover, they suggest a requirement for a persistent suppression of interneuron genes within maturing motor neurons.	[Stifani, Nicolas; Freitas, Adriana R.

In I the aromatic side chains were incorporated into a lactam structure, while in 2 N-amide alkylation was retained but the side chains were flexible. Both compounds produced comparable antinociceptive effects in the mouse tail flick test after peripheral administration. This indicates that lipophilicity, rather than side chain flexibility, is the key determinant for blood-CNS barrier penetration.

TRPV1 gene required for thermosensory transduction and anticipatory secretion from vasopressin neurons during hyperthermia	NEURON			English	Article							PROTEIN-KINASE-C; CAPSAICIN RECEPTOR; BODY-TEMPERATURE; CHANNEL SUBUNITS; CATION CHANNEL; ION CHANNELS; HEAT; ACTIVATION; TRPM5; COLOCALIZATION	Increases in core body temperature promote thermoregulatory cooling by stimulating sweat production and preemptive renal water reabsorption through the release of vasopressin (VP, antidiuretic hormone). The mechanism by which the hypothalamus orchestrates this anticipatory VP release during hyperthermia is unknown but has been linked to a central thermosensory mechanism. Here, we report that thermal stimuli spanning core body temperatures activate a calcium-permeable, ruthenium red- and SB366791 - sensitive nonselective cation conductance in hypothalamic VP neurons. This response is associated with a depolarizing receptor potential and an increase in action potential firing rate, indicating that these neurons are intrinsically thermosensitive. The thermosensitivity of VP neurons isolated from trpv1 knockout (Trpv1(-/-)) mice was significantly lower than that of wild-type counterparts. Moreover, Trpv1(-/-) mice showed an impaired VP response to hyperthermia in vivo. Channels encoded by the trpv1 gene thus confer thermosensitivity in central VP neurons and contribute to the thermal control of VP release in vivo.

While microarrays generate a substantial amount of false positive and spurious results, some of the extreme expression values may be valid and could represent true biological findings. Methods: We propose a simple method to screen brain microarray data to detect individual differences across a psychiatric sample set. We demonstrate in two different samples how this method can be applied. Results: This method targets high-throughput technology to psychiatric research on a subject-specific basis. Conclusion: Assessing microarray data for both mean group effects and individual effects can lead to more robust findings in psychiatric genetics.

Differential distribution of SK channel subtypes in the brain of the weakly electric fish Apteronotus leptorhynchus	JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE NEUROLOGY			English	Article						Apteronotus; sensory processing; pyramidal neurons; potassium channels; calcium	LATERAL-LINE LOBE; CA2+-ACTIVATED K+ CHANNELS; ACTIVATED POTASSIUM CHANNELS; P-LIKE IMMUNOREACTIVITY; CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; SMALL-CONDUCTANCE; GYMNOTIFORM FISH; ELECTROSENSORY SYSTEM; NUCLEUS-PRAEEMINENTIALIS; FUNCTIONAL-ORGANIZATION	Calcium signals in vertebrate neurons can induce hyperpolarizing membrane responses through the activation of Ca2+-activated potassium channels. Of these, small conductance (SK) channels regulate neuronal responses through the generation of the medium after-hyperpolarization (mAHP). We have previously shown that an SK channel (AptSK2) contributes to signal processing in the electrosensory system of Apteronotus leptorhynchus. It was shown that for pyramidal neurons in the electrosensory lateral line lobe (ELL), AptSK2 expression selectively decreases responses to low-frequency signals. The localization of all the SK subunits throughout the brain of Apteronotus then became of substantial interest. We have now cloned two additional SK channel subunits from Apteronotus and determined the expression patterns of all three AptSK subunits throughout the brain. In situ hybridization experiments have revealed that, as in mammalian systems, the AptSK1 and 2 channels showed a partially overlapping expression pattern, whereas the AptSK3 channel was expressed in different brain areas. The AptSK1 and 2 channels were the primary subunits found in the major electrosensory processing areas. Inummohistochemistry further revealed distinct compartmentalization of the AptSK1 and 2 channels in the ELL. AptSK1 was localized to the apical dendrites of pyramidal neurons, whereas AptSK2 channels are primarily somatic. The distinct expression patterns of all three AptSK channels may reflect subtype-specific contributions to neuronal function, and the high homology between subtypes from a number of species suggests that the functional roles for each channel subtype are conserved from early vertebrate evolution.

Functional MRI analysis showed significant correlation of spontaneous activity between the left and right primary sensorimotor area in both groups; however, there was no between-group difference. Structural MRI analysis showed significant correlation in gray matter density between the left and right sensorimotor areas in nonmusicians (r=0.65, P=0.001), but not in pianists (r=0.07, P=0.78), with a significant between-group difference (P=0.035). The lack of correlation of gray matter density between the left and right sensorimotor areas might be the basis of bimanual coordination of the pianists.

J	Azadpour, M; Balaban, E				Azadpour, Mahan; Balaban, Evan			Phonological Representations Are Unconsciously Used when Processing Complex, Non-Speech Signals	PLOS ONE			English	Article								Neuroimaging studies of speech processing increasingly rely on artificial speech-like sounds whose perceptual status as speech or non-speech is assigned by simple subjective judgments; brain activation patterns are interpreted according to these status assignments. The naive perceptual status of one such stimulus, spectrally-rotated speech (not consciously perceived as speech by naive subjects), was evaluated in discrimination and forced identification experiments. Discrimination of variation in spectrally-rotated syllables in one group of naive subjects was strongly related to the pattern of similarities in phonological identification of the same stimuli provided by a second, independent group of naive subjects, suggesting either that (1) naive rotated syllable perception involves phonetic-like processing, or (2) that perception is solely based on physical acoustic similarity, and similar sounds are provided with similar phonetic identities. Analysis of acoustic (Euclidean distances of center frequency values of formants) and phonetic similarities in the perception of the vowel portions of the rotated syllables revealed that discrimination was significantly and independently influenced by both acoustic and phonological information. We conclude that simple subjective assessments of artificial speech-like sounds can be misleading, as perception of such sounds may initially and unconsciously utilize speech-like, phonological processing.

A lesion of the right hemisphere of right-handers can result in verbal communication impairments. The recent development of theoretical frameworks with regard to discourse and pragmatic abilities, among others, now allows its to recognize and describe these impairments. Aim. To offer an overview of the verbal communication deficits that can be found in right-hemisphere-damaged individuals. These deficits can interfere, at different levels, with prosody, the semantic processing of words and discourse and pragmatic abilities. Development. Such impairments appear to be present in about half of right-hemisphere-damaged patients and, when present, can result in different clinical profiles. These deficits raise the question of their labeling and their relationship with aphasia. Conclusions. Given the evolution of the concept of language and the universal definition of aphasia, it is proposed that these deficits correspond to another manifestation of aphasia, thus challenging the idea that they are of a 'non-aphasic'nature.

Schizophrenia would be associated with an imbalance in inflammatory cytokines, leading to a decrease in Th1 and an increase in Th2 cytokine secretion. However, data published so far have been inconsistent. The primary objective of the present meta-analysis was to verify whether the cytokine imbalance hypothesis of schizophrenia is substantiated by evidence. Methods: Cross-sectional studies were included if they assessed in vivo plasma or serum cytokine concentrations and/or in vitro secretion of cytokines by peripheral blood leukocytes from schizophrenia patients and healthy volunteers. Results: Data from 62 studies involving a total sample size of 2298 schizophrenia patients and 1858 healthy volunteers remained for analysis. Ten cytokines were assessed, including the prototypic Th1 and Th2 cytokines gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) and interleukin 4 (IL-4) as well as IL-2, soluble IL-2 receptor (slL-2R), IL-1 beta, IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1 RA), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), IL-6, soluble IL-6 receptor (slL-6R), and IL-10. The results show that an increase occurs in in vivo IL-1 RA, slL-2R, and IL-6 and a decrease occurs in in vitro IL-2 in schizophrenia. No significant effect sizes were obtained for the other cytokines. Conclusions: These findings provide the first evidence of establishment of an inflammatory syndrome in schizophrenia, which refutes the current hypothesis of a Th2 slant. Caveats are presented to data interpretation, including the role of stress and the effect of weight gain that develops in schizophrenia.

Enzymatic activity of lysosomal carboxypeptidase (cathepsin) a is required for proper elastic fiber formation and inactivation of endothelin-1	CIRCULATION			English	Article						blood pressure; endothelin; enzymes; genes	A-LIKE ACTIVITY; PROTECTIVE PROTEIN; BETA-GALACTOSIDASE; INFANTILE GALACTOSIALIDOSIS; TRANSGENIC MICE; BINDING PROTEIN; ANGIOTENSIN-II; HUMAN TISSUES; HUMAN HEART; NEURAMINIDASE	Background - Lysosomal carboxypeptidase, cathepsin A ( protective protein, CathA), is a component of the lysosomal multienzyme complex along with beta- galactosidase ( GAL) and sialidase Neu1, where it activates Neu1 and protects GAL and Neu1 against the rapid proteolytic degradation. On the cell surface, CathA, Neu1, and the enzymatically inactive splice variant of GAL form the elastin- binding protein complex. In humans, genetic defects of CathA cause galactosialidosis, a metabolic disease characterized by combined deficiency of CathA, GAL, and Neu1 and a lysosomal storage of sialylated glycoconjugates. However, several phenotypic features of galactosialidosis patients, including hypertension and cardiomyopathies, cannot be explained by the lysosomal storage. These observations suggest that CathA may be involved in hemodynamic functions that go beyond its protective activity in the lysosome. Methods and Results - We generated a gene- targeted mouse in which the active CathA was replaced with a mutant enzyme carrying a Ser190Ala substitution in the active site. These animals expressed physiological amounts of catalytically inactive CathA protein, capable of forming lysosomal multienzyme complex, and did not develop secondary deficiency of Neu1 and GAL. Conversely, the mice showed a reduced degradation rate of the vasoconstrictor peptide, endothelin- 1, and significantly increased arterial blood pressure. CathA- deficient mice also displayed scarcity of elastic fibers in lungs, aortic adventitia, and skin. Conclusions - Our results provide the first evidence that CathA acts in vivo as an endothelin- 1 - inactivating enzyme and strongly confirm a crucial role of this enzyme in effective elastic fiber formation.

Dendritic morphology in these regions was studied on postnatal days (P) 2, 7, 14, 21, 35, and 70 in male Sprague-Dawley rats born either vaginally (VAG) or by Cesarean section either with (C + anoxia) or without (C-only) anoxia. The most striking birth group differences seen were at the level of dendritic spine densities on P35. During this postnatal period the dendritic spine density of PFC neurons was significantly lower in C + anoxia and C-only animals than in VAG controls; however, by P70 PFC spine densities in all birth groups were comparable. In contrast, hippocampal spine densities on P35 were comparably greater in C + anoxia animals than in VAG controls, whereas in C-only animals spine densities were lower than controls; here again, by P70 all groups had comparable hippocampal spine densities. In NAcc greater spine densities were seen on medium spiny neurons of C + anoxia animals on P35. These findings provide evidence that perinatal insult in the form of Cesarean birth with or without anoxia alters the dendritic development of PFC and hippocampal pyramidal neurons and to some extent also of NAcc medium spiny neurons. They also suggest that perinatal anoxia can alter the neuronal development of key structures thought to be affected in such late-onset dopamine-related disorders as schizophrenia and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).

Soluble adenylyl cyclase is not required for axon guidance to netrin-1	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						spinal commissural neurons; dorsal root ganglion; DRG; nerve growth factor; NGF; protein kinase A; PKA; pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide; PACAP	PROTEIN-KINASE-A; GROWTH-CONE ATTRACTION; SPINAL-CORD; CAMP; CELLS; MICE; SYSTEM; FAMILY; GENE; DCC	During development, axons are directed to their targets by extracellular guidance cues. The axonal response to the guidance cue netrin-1 is profoundly influenced by the concentration of cAMP within the growth cone. In some cases, cAMP affects the sensitivity of the growth cone to netrin-1, whereas in others it changes the response to netrin-1 from attraction to repulsion. The effects of cAMP on netrin-1 action are well accepted, but the critical issue of whether cAMP production is activated by a netrin-1 induced signaling cascade remains uncertain. A previous report has suggested that axon guidance in response to netrin-1 requires cAMP production mediated by soluble adenyl cyclase (sAC). We have used genetic, molecular and biochemical strategies to assess this issue. Surprisingly, we found only extremely weak expression of sAC in embryonic neurons and determined that, under conditions where netrin-1 directs axonal pathfinding, exposure to netrin-1 does not alter cAMP levels. Furthermore, although netrin-1-deficient mice exhibit major axon guidance defects, we show that pathfinding is normal in sAC-null mice. Therefore, although cAMP can alter the response of axons to netrin-1, we conclude that netrin-1 does not alter cAMP levels in axons attracted by this cue, and that sAC is not required for axon attraction to netrin-1.

Executive dysfunction and memory impairment in idiopathic REM sleep behavior disorder	NEUROLOGY			English	Article							PERIODIC LEG MOVEMENTS; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; LEWY BODIES; COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; NORMATIVE DATA; DEMENTIA; TRAIL; HALLUCINATIONS; PATHOLOGY; EEG	Background: Idiopathic REM sleep behavior disorder (iRBD) might be a stage in the development of neurodegenerative disorders, especially Parkinson disease and dementia with Lewy bodies. Recent studies showing a slowing of waking EEG in iRBD suggest that iRBD is associated with cognitive impairment. Objective: To compare patients with iRBD on measures of cognitive function and quantitative waking EEG. Methods: Fourteen patients with iRBD and 14 healthy control subjects matched for age and educational level were studied. Subjects underwent an extensive neuropsychological evaluation and waking EEG recordings. Results: Compared to controls, patients with iRBD showed a lower performance on neuropsychological tests measuring attention, executive functions, and verbal memory. Moreover, patients with iRBD showed EEG slowing (higher delta and theta power) during wakefulness in all brain areas compared to controls. However, no correlation was found between performance on cognitive tests and quantitative waking EEG in patients with iRBD. Conclusion: This study shows a co-occurrence of impaired cognitive profile and waking EEG slowing in patients with idiopathic REM sleep behavior disorder similar to that observed in early stages of some synucleinopathies.

Intracellular conversion of cobalamin to its two coenzymes, adenosylcobalamin in mitochondria and methylcobalamin in the cytoplasm, is necessary for the homeostasis of methylmalonic acid and homocysteine. Nine defects of intracellular cobalamin metabolism have been defined by means of somatic complementation analysis. One of these defects, the cblD defect, can cause isolated methylmalonic aciduria, isolated homocystinuria, or both. Affected persons present with multisystem clinical abnormalities, including developmental, hematologic, neurologic, and metabolic findings. The gene responsible for the cblD defect has not been identified. Methods: We studied seven patients with the cblD defect, and skin fibroblasts from each were investigated in cell culture. Microcell-mediated chromosome transfer and refined genetic mapping were used to localize the responsible gene. This gene was transfected into cblD fibroblasts to test for the rescue of adenosylcobalamin and methylcobalamin synthesis. Results: The cblD gene was localized to human chromosome 2q23.2, and a candidate gene, designated MMADHC (methylmalonic aciduria, cblD type, and homocystinuria), was identified in this region. Transfection of wild-type MMADHC rescued the cellular phenotype, and the functional importance of mutant alleles was shown by means of transfection with mutant constructs. The predicted MMADHC protein has sequence homology with a bacterial ATP-binding cassette transporter and contains a putative cobalamin binding motif and a putative mitochondrial targeting sequence. Conclusions: Mutations in a gene we designated MMADHC are responsible for the cblD defect in vitamin B-12 metabolism. Various mutations are associated with each of the three biochemical phenotypes of the disorder.

Neurodevelopmental trajectories of the human cerebral cortex	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						brain development; cytoarchitecture; cognition; cerebral cortex; prefrontal cortex; primate	CORTICAL THICKNESS; HUMAN BRAIN; CRITICAL PERIOD; EXECUTIVE FUNCTION; SENSITIVE PERIODS; LONGITUDINAL MRI; CHILDREN; ADOLESCENTS; CHILDHOOD; EVOLUTION	Understanding the organization of the cerebral cortex remains a central focus of neuroscience. Cortical maps have relied almost exclusively on the examination of postmortem tissue to construct structural, architectonic maps. These maps have invariably distinguished between areas with fewer discernable layers, which have a less complex overall pattern of lamination and lack an internal granular layer, and those with more complex laminar architecture. The former includes several agranular limbic areas, and the latter includes the homotypical and granular areas of association and sensory cortex. Here, we relate these traditional maps to developmental data from noninvasive neuroimaging. Changes in cortical thickness were determined in vivo from 764 neuroanatomic magnetic resonance images acquired longitudinally from 375 typically developing children and young adults. We find differing levels of complexity of cortical growth across the cerebrum, which align closely with established architectonic maps. Cortical regions with simple laminar architecture, including most limbic areas, predominantly show simpler growth trajectories. These areas have clearly identified homologues in all mammalian brains and thus likely evolved in early mammals. In contrast, polysensory and high- order association areas of cortex, the most complex areas in terms of their laminar architecture, also have the most complex developmental trajectories. Some of these areas are unique to, or dramatically expanded in primates, lending an evolutionary significance to the findings. Furthermore, by mapping a key characteristic of these development trajectories ( the age of attaining peak cortical thickness) we document the dynamic, heterochronous maturation of the cerebral cortex through time lapse sequences ("movies").

MC-1 (pyridoxal 5'-phosphate) is a novel agent that has shown promise in reducing myocardial necrosis by reducing cellular calcium overload after percutaneous coronary intervention and CABG surgery in high-risk patients undergoing these procedures. Methods MEND-CABG II is a phase III study evaluating the efficacy and safety of MC-1 in reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality after CABG. High-risk patients undergoing CABG surgery will be randomly assigned to receive either MC-1 (250 mg/d) or matching placebo immediately before and continuing for 30 days after the procedure. The primary end point is the occurrence of cardiovascular death or nonfatal myocardial infarction through postoperative day 30. A total of 3023 patients were enrolled at 130 sites in Canada, the United States, and Germany between October 2006 and September 2007, with results anticipated shortly after completion of 90-day follow-up in March 2008. Conclusions The data from the MEND-CABG II trial will establish whether peri- and postoperative treatment with MC-1 can decrease the short- and intermediate-term morbidity and mortality of high-risk patients undergoing CABG surgery.

ANP and BNP bind to natriuretic peptide receptor-A (NPR-A) generating cGMP and to NPR-C, a clearance receptor that can decrease intracellular cAMP. To determine the role of NPR-A signaling in IR lung injury, we administered the NPR-A blocker anantin in an in vivo SWR mouse preparation of unilateral lung IR. With uninterrupted ventilation, the left pulmonary artery was occluded for 30 min and then reperfused for 60 or 150 min. Anantin administration decreased IR-induced Evans blue dye extravasation and wet weight in the reperfused left lung, suggesting an injurious role for NPR-A signaling in lung IR. In isolated mouse lungs, exogenous ANP (2.5 nM) added to the perfusate significantly increased the filtration coefficient sevenfold only if lungs were subjected to IR. This effect of ANP was also blocked by anantin. Unilateral in vivo IR increased endogenous plasma ANP, lung cGMP concentration, and lung protein kinase G (PKG(I)) activation. Anantin enhanced plasma ANP concentrations and attenuated the increase in cGMP and PKGI activation but had no effect on lung cAMP. These data suggest that lung IR triggered ANP release and altered endothelial signaling so that NPR-A activation caused increased pulmonary endothelial permeability.

Tasks included odor-delayed win-shift (nonspatial working and reference memory), win-stay (habit learning), and attentional set-shifting (attention and behavioral flexibility). In Experiment 1, the SHR strain was compared with Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) and Wistar-Kyoto Hypertensive (WKHT) strains on the first 2 tasks. In Experiment 2, oral methylphenidate (1.5 mg/kg) and vehicle (water) were evaluated on all 3 tasks in SHR and WKY strains. Results demonstrated that the SHR made significantly more errors in the odor-delayed win-shift, win-stay, and attentional set-shifting tasks compared with the WKY. Similar performances in the WKY and WKHT indicated that deficits observed in the SHR were not related solely to hypertension. Treating the SHR with methylphenidate eliminated strain differences in all 3 tasks. These findings provide evidence that the SHR is a valid model for studying ADHD-associated neurocognitive deficits. Moreover, the current behavioral approach is appropriate to assess novel medications developed to target ADHD-associated neurocognitive deficits.	[Kantak, K. M.; Singh, T.; Kerstetter, K.

In Experiment 1, ovariectomized, hormone-primed rats were conditioned to associate scented and unscented male rats with paced and nonpaced copulation, respectively. Female rats in Experiment 2 associated albino or pigmented male rats with paced or nonpaced copulation. Naloxone or saline was administered before each conditioning trial. During a final drug-free preference test, female rats could choose to copulate with either a pacing related or unrelated male. Saline-trained female rats in the paired group copulated preferentially with the pacing-related male rat, whereas naloxone-trained female rats did not show a preference. The authors concluded that opioids mediated the conditioned partner preference induced by paced copulation.

Many previous neuroimaging studies have provided consistent evidence of dysfunctional connectivity among the brain regions in schizophrenia; however, little is known about whether or not this dysfunctional connectivity causes disruption of the topological properties of brain functional networks. To this end, we investigated the topological properties of human brain functional networks derived from resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Data was obtained from 31 schizophrenia patients and 31 healthy subjects; then functional connectivity between 90 cortical and sub-cortical regions was estimated by partial correlation analysis and thresholded to construct a set of undirected graphs. Our findings demonstrated that the brain functional networks had efficient small-world properties in the healthy subjects; whereas these properties were disrupted in the patients with schizophrenia. Brain functional networks have efficient small-world properties which support efficient parallel information transfer at a relatively low cost. More importantly, in patients with schizophrenia the small-world topological properties are significantly altered in many brain regions in the prefrontal, parietal and temporal lobes. These findings are consistent with a hypothesis of dysfunctional integration of the brain in this illness. Specifically, we found that these altered topological measurements correlate with illness duration in schizophrenia. Detection and estimation of these alterations could prove helpful for understanding the pathophysiological mechanism as well as for evaluation of the severity of schizophrenia.

We report a study examining the relationship between the anatomy of Heschl's Gyrus (HG), which includes predominately primary auditory areas and is often found to be associated with nonlinguistic pitch processing and language learning. Unlike English, most languages of the world use pitch patterns to signal word meaning. In the present study, native English-speaking adult subjects learned to incorporate foreign pitch patterns in word identification. Subjects who were less successful in learning showed a smaller HG volume on the left (especially gray matter volume), but not on the right, relative to learners who were successful. These results suggest that HG, typically shown to be associated with the processing of acoustic cues in nonspeech processing, is also involved in speech learning. These results also suggest that primary auditory regions may be important for encoding basic acoustic cues during the course of spoken language learning.	[Wong, Patrick C.

Although aetilogy is often unknown, it is established that multiple factors such as defects in genetics and/or epigenetics, the environment as well as imbalance in neurotransmitter receptor systems are all at play in determining an individual's susceptibility to disease. Gene therapy is currently not available and therefore, most conditions are treated with pharmacological agents that modify neurotransmitter receptor signaling. Here, I provide a review of ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs) and the roles they fulfill in numerous CNS disorders. Specifically, I argue that our understanding of iGluRs has reached a critical turning point to permit, for the first time, a comprehensive re-evaluation of their role in the cause of disease. I illustrate this by highlighting how defects in AMPA receptor (AMPAR) trafficking are important to fragile X mental retardation and ectopic expression of kainate receptor (KAR) synapses contributes to the pathology of temporal lobe epilepsy. Finally, I discuss how parallel advances in studies of other neurotransmitter systems may allow pharmacologists to work towards a cure for many CNS disorders rather than developing drugs to treat their symptoms.

Here, we describe another mode of neurogenesis where neural stem cells generate secondary precursors that undergo multiple rounds of self-renewing transit-amplifying divisions. We identify the Posterior Asense-Negative (PAN neuroblasts, which do not express the transcription factors Asense or Prospero. PAN neuroblasts rely on the segregating determinants Numb and Brat to generate smaller, secondary neuroblasts that in turn give rise to ganglion mother cells (GMCs) and neurons throughout larval development. In brat or numb mutants, misspecified secondary neuroblasts are unable to produce differentiated progeny and initiate tumor-like overgrowth. In prospero mutants, however, tumors arise from GMCs while secondary neuroblasts are correctly specified. Our data describe a transit-amplifying lineage in the Drosophila nervous system and suggest that different vulnerabilities in intermediate cell types can affect the outcome of tumor suppressor loss in stem cell lineages.

Novel pre- and post-gastrulation expression of gata4 within cells of the inner cell mass and migratory neural crest cells	DEVELOPMENTAL DYNAMICS			English	Article						Gata4; gene expression; embryonic stem cells; inner cell mass; neural crest cells; reporter mouse models	EMBRYONIC STEM-CELLS; TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR GATA-4; HEART TUBE FORMATION; GENE-EXPRESSION; MOUSE EMBRYO; VENTRAL MORPHOGENESIS; PRIMITIVE ENDODERM; VISCERAL ENDODERM; SEX DETERMINATION; NERVOUS-SYSTEM	GATA4 is a transcription factor known to be important for the development of many organs such as the heart, intestine, and gonads. However, information regarding the control of its expression is only now beginning to emerge. To further understand the regulation of Gata4 expression during mouse embryonic development, we have generated a novel knockin allele allowing expression of the Cre recombinase under the control of Gata4 regulatory sequences. When these Gata4(Cre/+) mice were crossed with the Cre reporter mouse R26R-YFP, we surprisingly found widespread mosaic YFP expression in e10.0 embryos. This particular expression pattern was traced back to the e5.5 stage via a cell lineage study, suggesting activation of transcription at the Gata4 locus around the blastocyst stage. In accordance with this hypothesis, we found that Gata4 is expressed in cultured embryonic stem (ES) cells and within the inner cell mass (ICM) of e4.5 blastocysts. Interestingly, such early Gata4 transcription can be recapitulated in transgenic reporter studies using 5 kb of the proximal rat Gata4 promoter. During mouse development, these 5-kb regulatory sequences were previously reported to direct reporter gene expression to Sertoli cells of the testes [Mazaud Guittot et al. (2007) Biol Reprod 76:85-951. We now show that these regulatory sequences can also drive robust fluorescent reporter gene expression in migratory neural crest cells. Comparisons to WntlCre-mediated YFP labelling of neural crest cells suggest that most of the migratory neural crest cells are labelled in e9.5 to e11.5 Gata4p[5kb]-RFP or -GFP embryos. Analysis of GFP transcription via whole-mount in situ hybridization in e10.5 and e11.5 embryos demonstrated that the 5-kb Gata4 promoter is preferentially active in cells of the boundary caps at the dorsal root entry zone and motor exit points flanking the neural tube. RT-PCR gene expression analysis of FACS-purifled GFP-positive cells from e9.5 Gata4p[5kb]-GFP embryos revealed co-expression of Gata4 with many neural crest stem cell markers. Together with sphere-forming and differentiation cell culture assays, our results indicate that the Gata4 promoter is active within at least a subset of the neural crest stem cells. Taken altogether, our studies have revealed new Gata4 expression patterns during mouse embryonic development, which are controlled by its 5-kb proximal 5' flanking sequences.

We show here that they also upregulate the expression of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, laminin, and chondroitin sulfated proteoglycan, that are deposited in astrocytic scars in vivo. We have previously shown that the major functional ECM receptors on astrocytes are dystroglycan (DG) plus integrins alpha 1 beta 1, alpha 5 beta 1, alpha 6 beta 1, and alpha v beta 3. Consistent with this, laminin fragments that activate alpha 1 beta 1 integrin, alpha 6 beta 1 integrin, and DG all contribute to attachment. During astrocyte attachment, or process extension, integrins and DG are found at the leading edge of the lammelipodium, though they change in distribution with the extent of attachment and the a and P subunits of DG can be spatially uncoupled. Functionally, inhibitory antibodies to DG and integrin alpha 1 beta 1 or the RGD peptide all inhibit process extension, showing that ligand engagement of integrins and DG contribute to process extension. Astrocytes differentiated from DG or beta 1 null ES cells respond very differently to wounding. The former fail to extend process and cell polarization is disrupted partially. However, beta 1 null astrocytes not only fail to extend processes perpendicular to the wound, but cell polarization is completely disrupted and cells migrate randomly into the wound. We conclude that integrins are essential for astrocyte polarity. (C) 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Alpha synuclein protein levels are increased in serum from recently abstinent-cocaine abusers	DRUG AND ALCOHOL DEPENDENCE			English	Article						cocaine; serum; dopamine; craving; synuclein	MESSENGER-RNA LEVELS; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; DOPAMINE TRANSPORTER; ASSOCIATION; ALCOHOL; SNCA; GENE; ASSIGNMENT; DEPENDENCE; DISORDERS	Alpha synuclein is increased in dopamine neurons of cocaine abusers and in rats whose alcohol preference is inbred. Recent studies have shown increased alpha synuclein protein expression in serum of alcoholic patients that is linked with severity of alcohol craving. The aim of this study was to analyze the serum levels of alpha synuclein in healthy subjects and in recently abstinent cocaine abusers. Alpha synuclein protein expression was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in serum specimens obtained from 38 recently abstinent cocaine dependent patients and 14 control subjects. The presence of cocaine dependence disorder was based on the Structured Clinical Interview (DSM-IV). Drug severity was assessed by the Addiction Severity Index ratings and composite measures. Scores of the intensity and frequency of cocaine craving episodes were obtained from the Minnesota Cocaine Craving Questionnaire. The serum concentrations of alpha synuclein in cocaine dependent patients were significantly higher as compared with age-matched drug-free controls (p < 0.001). Alpha synuclein levels in blood were significantly correlated with the intensity (r = 0.60 p < 0.001) and frequency (r = 0.64, p < 0.001) of cocaine craving and with 30 days of cocaine use in the prior month before entry to treatment (r = 0.56, p < 0.005). However, there was no correlation between the serum protein levels of alpha synuclein and age in either group. This report is the first demonstration of altered alpha synuclein levels in peripheral blood from cocaine abusers. These data agree with previous reports in postmortem brain of cocaine abusers and provide support for an association between alpha synuclein and cocaine dependence. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Mental fatigue alters the pattern and increases the volume of cerebral activation required for a motor task in multiple sclerosis patients with fatigue	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROLOGY			English	Article						fatigue; functional imaging; multiple sclerosis; PASAT	ADAPTIVE FUNCTIONAL-CHANGES; BRAIN REORGANIZATION; CORTEX; FMRI; INJURY; MRI; DISABILITY; MOVEMENT; IMPACT; EXTENT	Fatigue is one of the most disabling symptoms in multiple sclerosis (MS) and there is increasing evidence it has a central origin. Our aim was to assess the impact of mental fatigue on motor task-related cerebral activation. Ten relapsing-remitting MS patients with fatigue were recruited and compared with seven controls. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data were acquired while subjects performed a finger-thumb apposition task. The Paced-Auditory-Serial Addition Task (PASAT) was administered to induce fatigue and the fMRI motor paradigm was then repeated. Our results revealed that the PASAT altered the MS patients' activation patterns on the motor task. After the mentally fatiguing PASAT task, repeating the motor task was associated with patients recruiting significantly more of their brain including bilateral cingulate gyri and left primary sensory cortex, while activating less of the left premotor and supplementary motor area. The control subjects decreased their level of activation after the PASAT. Our current results reveal that a challenging mental task can alter the pattern and increase the volume of cerebral activation on an unrelated motor task in fatigued MS patients. These data support the hypothesis that a substrate for MS fatigue could be a generally elevated demand placed on functioning neural circuits.	[Tartaglia, M. C.; Narayanan, S.; Arnold, D.

Evidence for a novel functional role of cannabinoid CB2 receptors in the thalamus of neuropathic rats	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						electrophysiology; JWH-133; neuropathic pain; spinal nerve ligation; VPL	CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; ACID AMIDE HYDROLASE; DORSAL-HORN NEURONS; MICROGLIAL CELLS; INDUCED ANTINOCICEPTION; PROTEIN EXPRESSION; SAPHENOUS NERVE; CHRONIC PAIN; SPINAL-CORD; NAIVE RATS	Cannabinoid CB1 receptors have analgesic effects in models of neuropathic pain, but can also produce psychoactive side-effects. A supraspinal location of CB2 receptors has recently been described. CB2 agonists are also antinociceptive, although the functional role of supraspinal CB2 receptors in the control of nociception is unknown. Herein, we provide evidence that CB2 receptors in the thalamus play a functional role in the modulation of responses of neurons in the ventral posterior nucleus (VPL) of the thalamus in neuropathic, but not sham-operated, rats. Spontaneous and mechanically evoked activity of VPL neurons was recorded with a multichannel electrode array in anaesthetized spinal nerve-ligated (SNL) rats and compared to sham-operated rats. Intra-VPL administration of the CB2 agonist JWH-133 (30 ng in 500 nL) significantly reduced spontaneous (P < 0.05), non-noxious (P < 0.001) and noxious (P < 0.01) mechanically evoked responses of VPL neurons in SNL rats, but not in sham-operated rats. Inhibitory effects of JWH-133 on spontaneous (P < 0.01) and noxious-evoked (P < 0.001) responses of neurons were blocked by the CB2 antagonist SR144528. Local administration of SR144528 alone did not alter spontaneous or evoked responses of VPL neurons, but increased burst activity of VPL neurons in SNL rats. There were, however, no differences in levels of the endocannabinoids anandamide and 2AG in the thalamus of SNL and sham-operated rats.

Methods: We critically reviewed the literature to assess the clinical value of nomograms in clinical decision making. Results: The nomogram methodology offers a valid approach for the most accurate individual risk stratification. In the presence of sparse prospective evidence, most accurate and reliable retrospective risk stratification is helpful in clinical decision making. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that clinical decision making represents a challenging and complex procedure. Unbiased risk stratification improves clinical decision making. However, careful selection and acknowledgement of limitations prior to choosing a decision aid are mandatory. (c) 2008 European Association of Urology. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The method provides an intuitively simple approach to clustering and makes no assumptions of the number of clusters in the data or their underlying distribution. The performance of the method and its dependence on the intrinsic parameters (size of the neighborhood, form of the interaction term, etc.) is investigated on the simulated data and real fMRI data acquired during a conventional periodic finger tapping task. The merits of incorporating Euclidean information into the connectivity analysis are discussed. The ability of the Potts model clustering to uncover the hidden structure in the complex data is demonstrated through its application to the resting-state data to determine functional connectivity networks of the anterior and posterior cingulate cortices for the group of nine healthy male subjects.

We provide an example of ACC using computational techniques within the context of cross-sectional analysis of magnetic resonance images (MRI) in neurodegenerative diseases, namely Alzheimer's dementia (AD). In this paper, the accuracy of our ACC methodology is assessed when presented with real life, imperfect data, i.e., cohorts of MRI with varying acquisition parameters and imaging quality. The comparative methodology uses the Jacobian determinants derived from dense deformation fields and scaled grey-level intensity from a selected volume of interest centered on the medial temporal lobe. The ACC performance is assessed in a series of leave-one-out experiments aimed at separating 75 probable AD and 75 age-matched normal controls. The resulting accuracy is 92% using a support vector machine classifier based on least squares optimization. Finally, it is shown in the Appendix that determinants and scaled grey-level intensity are appreciably more robust to varying parameters in validation studies using simulated data, when compared to raw intensities or grey/white matter volumes. The ability of cross-sectional MRI at detecting probable AD with high accuracy could have profound implications in the management of suspected AD candidates.

However, training the neural network model with the maximum-likelihood criterion requires computations proportional to the number of words in the vocabulary. In this paper, we introduce adaptive importance sampling as a way to accelerate training of the model. The idea is to use in adaptive,n-gram model to track the conditional distributions produced by the neural network. We show that a very significant speedup call be obtained on standard problems.

Seventy-nine typically developed individual served as the control group. In a subset of 17 persons with ASD and 11 controls matched for verbal IQ, dream narratives were obtained following REM sleep awakenings in a sleep laboratory. Questionnaires revealed that participants with ASD, compared to controls, had fewer recollections of dreaming, fewer bad dreams and fewer emotions. In the sleep laboratory, dream content narratives following REM sleep awakenings were shorter in ASD participants than in controls. ASD participants also reported fewer settings, objects, characters, social interactions, activities, and emotions. It is concluded that these characteristics of dreaming in ASD may reflect neurocognitive dimensions specific to this condition.

Consequences are multifaceted and include activity limitations in daily-living skills, academic challenges, diminished socialization skills, and motor difficulties. Poor handwriting performance is an example of an affected life skill that has been anecdotally observed by educators and clinicians for this population and can negatively impact academic performance and self-esteem. To guide health and educational service delivery needs, the authors reviewed the evidence in the literature on handwriting difficulties in children with ADHD. Existing evidence would suggest that children with ADHD have impaired handwriting performance, characterized by illegible written material and/or inappropriate speed of execution compared to children without ADHD. Studies with larger sample sizes using standardized measures of handwriting performance are needed to evaluate the prevalence of the problem and to better understand the nature of handwriting difficulties and their impact in this population.

However, findings regarding the role of this region specifically in emotion recognition have been mixed. We used a sensitive facial emotion recognition task to compare the emotion recognition performance of 7 subjects with lesions confined to ventromedial prefrontal regions, 8 subjects with lesions elsewhere in prefrontal cortex, and 16 healthy control subjects. We found that emotion recognition was impaired following ventromedial, but not dorsal or lateral, prefrontal damage. This impairment appeared to be quite general, with lower overall ratings or more confusion between all six emotions examined. We also explored the relationship between emotion recognition performance and the ability of the same patients to experience transient happiness and sadness during a laboratory mood induction. We found some support for a relationship between sadness recognition and experience. Taken together, our results indicate that the ventromedial frontal lobe plays a crucial role in facial emotion recognition, and suggest that this deficit may be related to the subjective experience of emotion.

Such correlated activity could be a critical feature in the encoding and decoding of information in central circuits. Here we characterize correlated activity in response to two biologically relevant classes of sensory stimuli in the primary electrosensory nuclei, the electrosensory lateral line lobe, of the weakly electric fish Apteronotus leptorhynchus. Our results show that these neurons can display significant correlations in their baseline activities that depend on the amount of receptive field overlap. A detailed analysis of spike trains revealed that correlated activity resulted predominantly from a tendency to fire synchronous or anti-synchronous bursts of spikes. We also explored how different stimulation protocols affected correlated activity: while prey-like stimuli increased correlated activity, conspecific-like stimuli decreased correlated activity. We also computed the correlations between the variabilities of each neuron to repeated presentations of the same stimulus (noise correlations) and found lower amounts of noise correlation for communication stimuli. Therefore the decrease in correlated activity seen with communication stimuli is caused at least in part by reduced noise correlations. This differential modulation in correlated activity occurred because of changes in burst firing at the individual neuron level. Our results show that different categories of behaviorally relevant input will differentially affect correlated activity. In particular, we show that the number of correlated bursts within a given time window could be used by postsynaptic neurons to distinguish between both stimulus categories.

Ionic basis of ON and OFF persistent activity in layer III lateral entorhinal cortical principal neurons	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article							MUSCARINIC RECEPTOR ACTIVATION; CHOLINERGIC DEAFFERENTATION; POTASSIUM CHANNELS; FAMILIAR STIMULI; FLUFENAMIC ACID; WORKING-MEMORY; CORTEX NEURONS; CATION CURRENT; K+ CHANNELS; RAT-BRAIN	Principal neurons in layer III of the rat lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) generate a self-sustained plateau potential and persistent spiking following the application of a brief suprathreshold excitatory stimulus delivered in the presence of the muscarinic receptor agonist carbachol. This persistent activity can be terminated by application of a second excitatory stimulus, and these cells can be repeatedly toggled between ON and OFF states by consecutive excitatory stimuli. However, the ionic mechanisms that underlie the production of ON and OFF states in layer III LEC neurons are unknown but seem to involve activity-dependent conductances, since they can be initiated by trains of action potentials evoked by either depolarizing current pulses applied to the cell or by repetitive spiking induced by activation of excitatory synaptic inputs. In this study, we obtained intracellular recordings from rat layer III LEC neurons in vitro, and a series of pharmacological and ionic substitution experiments were performed to identify mechanisms involved in the induction and termination of persistent spiking. Our data indicate that initiation of the ON state depends on spike-evoked calcium influx and subsequent activation of calcium-activated nonselective cationic current. Moreover, we show that termination of persistent firing in response to an excitatory stimulus can be blocked by tetraethylammonium or iberiotoxin, suggesting that the activation of calcium-activated potassium current mediated by large conductance calcium-activated K+ (i.e., BK) channels is required to induce the OFF state.

Dietary and genetic compromise in folate availability reduces acetylcholine, cognitive performance and increases aggression: Critical role of S-adenosyl methionine	JOURNAL OF NUTRITION HEALTH & AGING			English	Article							ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; APOLIPOPROTEIN-E; METHYLENETETRAHYDROFOLATE-REDUCTASE; BEHAVIORAL SYMPTOMS; OXIDATIVE STRESS; MOUSE MODEL; RISK-FACTOR; PSYCHOLOGICAL SYMPTOMS; BETA METABOLISM; DEFICIENT MICE	Folate deficiency has been associated with age-related neurodegeneration. One direct consequence of folate deficiency is a decline in the major methyl donor, S-adenosyl methionine (SAM). We demonstrate herein that pro-oxidant stress and dietary folate deficiency decreased levels of acetylcholine and impaired cognitive performance to various degrees in normal adult mice (9-12months of age, adult mice heterozygously lacking 5',10'-methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase, homozygously lacking apolipoprotein E, or expressing human ApoE2, E3 or E4, and aged (2-2.5 year old) normal mice. Dietary supplementation with SAM in the absence of folate restored acetylcholine levels and cognitive performance to respective levels observed in the presence of folate. Increased aggressive behavior was observed among some but not all genotypes when maintained on the deficient diet, and was eliminated in all cases supplementation with SAM. Folate deficiency decreased levels of choline and N-methyl nicotinamine, while dietary supplementation with SAM increased methylation of nicotinamide to generate N-methyl nicotinamide and restored choline levels within brain tissue. Since N-methyl nicotinamide inhibits choline transport out of the central nervous system, and choline is utilized as an alternative methyl donor, these latter findings suggest that SAM may maintain acetylcholine levels in part by maintaining availability of choline. These findings suggest that dietary supplementation with SAM represents a useful therapeutic approach for age-related neurodegeneration which may augment pharmacological approaches to maintain acetylcholine levels, in particular during dietary or genetic compromise in folate usage.

This study evaluates the analgesic activity of tetrodotoxin, a highly selective sodium channel blocker. This randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel design study of subcutaneous tetrodotoxin, in patients with moderate or severe unrelieved cancer pain persisting despite best available treatment, involved 22 centers across Canada. The design called for tetrodotoxin administered subcutaneously over Days 1-4 with a period of observation to Day 15 or longer. All patients could enroll into an open-label extension efficacy and safety trial. The primary endpoint was the proportion of analgesic responders in each treatment arm. Eighty-two patients were randomized, and results on 77 were available for analysis. There was a nonstatistically significant trend toward more responders in the active treatment arm based on the primary endpoint (pain intensity difference). However, analysis of secondary endpoints, and an exploratory post hoc analysis, suggested there may be a robust analgesic. effect if a composite endpoint is used, including either fall in pain level, or fall in opioid dose, plus improvement in quality of life. Most patients described transient perioral tingling or other mild sensory phenomena within about an hour of each treatment. Nausea and other toxicities were generally mild, but one patient experienced a serious, adverse event, truncal and gait ataxia. This trial suggests tetrodotoxin may potentially relieve moderate to severe, treatment-resistant cancer pain in a large proportion of patients, and often for prolonged periods following treatment, but further study is warranted using a composite primary endpoint.

Systemic glucocorticoid therapy reduces pain and the number of endoneurial tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF alpha)-positive mast cells in rats with a painful peripheral neuropathy	JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	80th Annual Meeting of the Japanese-Pharmacological-Society	MAR 14-16, 2007	Nagoya, JAPAN	Japanese Pharmacol Soc		glucocorticoid; hyperalgesia; mast cell; neuropathic pain; tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF alpha)	NERVE INJURY; SCIATIC-NERVE; WALLERIAN DEGENERATION; HYPERALGESIA; MODEL; METHYLPREDNISOLONE; INFLAMMATION; EXPRESSION; ALLODYNIA; CYTOKINES	Clinical and experimental evidence suggests that glucocorticoids may be effective in the treatment of neuropathic pain, but their mechanism of action is unknown. We gave triamcinolone (3 mg/kg) to rats with an experimental post-traumatic painful peripheral neuropathy, chronic constriction injury (CCI), five days after nerve injury, when the abnormal pain syndrome is known to be present; and pain sensitivity was measured on postoperative days 7 - 14, a period during which symptoms are known to be at approximately peak severity. Additional CCI rats were treated similarly; and then they were sacrificed five days after the injection for an immunocytochemical analysis of endoneurial tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF alpha), macrophages, and mast cells in the sciatic nerve proximal to the site of injury. Vehicle-injected CCI rats demonstrated the expected neuropathic pain symptoms. Triamcinolone-treated CCI rats had a statistically significant reduction in the magnitude of heat-hyperalgesia and mechano-allodynia, but there was no effect on cold-allodynia or mechano-hyperalgesia. On the nerve-injured side of vehicle-injected rats, TNFa was present in Schwann cells and mast cells. On the nerve-injured side of triamcinolone-treated rats, there was a significant (71.5%) reduction in the number of TNF alpha-positive mast cells. Our results suggest that glucocorticoid therapy for neuropathic pain may work via the reduced expression of TNF alpha in endoneurial mast cells.

These network-driven epileptiform events consist of field oscillatory sequences at frequencies greater than 200 Hz that most often initiate in the lateral EC and propagate to the medial EC with 4-63 ms delays. The NMDA receptor antagonist CPP depresses the rate of occurrence (P < 0.01) of these spontaneous epileptiform discharges but fails in blocking them. Paradoxically, stimulus-induced epileptiform responses are enhanced in duration during CPP application. However, concomitant application of NMDA and non-NMDA glutamatergic antagonists abolishes spontaneous and stimulus-induced epileptiform events. Intracellular recordings from lateral EC layer V cells indicate a lower frequency of spontaneous hyperpolarizing postsynaptic potentials in pilocarpine-treated tissue than in NEC (P < 0.002) both under control conditions and with glutamatergic receptor blockade; the reversal potential of pharmacologically isolated GABA(A) receptor-mediated inhibitory postsynaptic potentials has similar values in the two types of tissue. Finally, immunohistochemical analysis shows that parvalbumin-positive interneurons are selectively reduced in number in EC deep layers. Collectively, these results indicate that reduced inhibition within the pilocarpine-treated EC layer V may promote network epileptic hyperexcitability.

Serum albumin level as a predictor of outcome in traumatic brain injury: Potential for treatment	JOURNAL OF TRAUMA-INJURY INFECTION AND CRITICAL CARE			English	Article						traumatic brain injury; albumin; oedema; neurological outcome; therapy	FOCAL CEREBRAL-ISCHEMIA; MARKED NEUROPROTECTIVE EFFICACY; COLLOID ONCOTIC THERAPY; PLASMA-PROTEINS; RATS; EDEMA; MORTALITY; ANTIOXIDANT; INFARCTION; OCCLUSION	Background: Serum albumin level is correlated with outcome in various clinical situations. Albumin has multiple physiologic properties that could be beneficial in brain injury. The Lund therapy for elevated intracranial pressure uses albumin as part of its protocol and demonstrates favorable outcome. We sought to find out if albumin is associated with outcome after traumatic brain injury to justify conducting a randomized trial. Methods: A retrospective study of traumatic brain injury patients was conducted. Characteristics known to influence outcome were included in a multiple logistic regression model to analyze predictors of poor outcome at 6 months. Results: Data were available for 138 patients. The majority of patients (65%) had a severe injury (Glasgow Coma Scale score <9). Seventy percent of patients had a favorable outcome. Albumin levels decrease considerably from normal values in the first few days after injury irrespective of outcome. Albumin remained <25 g/L for a longer period of time in patient with an unfavorable outcome (6 days vs. 3 days, p = 0.012). Multiple logistic regression analysis identified albumin levels, age, Glasgow Coma Scale score at admission, and Injury Severity Score as predictors of poor outcome. Conclusion: Serum albumin level seems to be an independent predictor of poor outcome. The model also identified classic predictors of poor outcome that tends to strengthen its adequacy. Because albumin level is the only modifiable factor influencing outcome, it seems justified to carry out a randomized trial of the use of albumin in the treatment of brain injury.

Contribution of TRPV channels to osmosensory transduction, thirst, and vasopressin release	KIDNEY INTERNATIONAL			English	Review						TRPV; vasopressin; thirst; osmoreceptors; osmoregulation	VASCULOSUM LAMINAE TERMINALIS; SUPRAOPTIC NEURONS; RAT HYPOTHALAMUS; WATER-INTAKE; RESPONSES; OSMORECEPTION; SECRETION; NUCLEUS; MICE	Systemic osmoregulation is an integrated physiological process through which water intake and excretion are continuously balanced against salt intake and excretion to maintain the osmolality of the extracellular fluid near an optimal 'set-point' value. The behaviors (that is, thirst and sodium appetite) and renal responses (diuresis and natriuresis) that are modulated to mediate osmoregulatory homeostasis are mainly controlled by the nervous system. Appropriate regulation of these parameters depends in large part on specialized osmosensitive neurons, termed osmoreceptors, which convert changes in plasma osmolality into electrical signals that ultimately modulate effector functions to achieve homeostasis. Previous work has shown that mechanosensitive cation channels expressed in osmoreceptor neurons play a key role in the process of osmosensory transduction. Although the molecular identity of these channels remains unknown, a growing body of evidence, reviewed here, indicates that members of the transient receptor potential vanilloid family of ion channels may contribute to osmosensory transduction and to homeostatic responses implicated in the control of water balance.

The guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) linking netrin-1/ DCC to Rac1 activation has not yet been identified. Here, we show that the RhoGEF Trio mediates Rac1 activation in netrin-1 signaling. We found that Trio interacts with the netrin-1 receptor DCC in mouse embryonic brains and that netrin-1-induced Rac1 activation in brain is impaired in the absence of Trio. Trio(-/-) cortical neurons fail to extend neurites in response to netrin-1, while they are able to respond to glutamate. Accordingly, netrin-1-induced commissural axon outgrowth is reduced in Trio-/- spinal cord explants, and the guidance of commissural axons toward the floor plate is affected by the absence of Trio. The anterior commissure is absent in Trio-null embryos, and netrin-1/DCC-dependent axonal projections that form the internal capsule and the corpus callosum are defective in the mutants. Taken together, these findings establish Trio as a GEF that mediates netrin-1 signaling in axon outgrowth and guidance through its ability to activate Rac1.

Such a musical disorder is now termed "congenital amusia," an umbrella term for lifelong musical disabilities that cannot be attributed to mental retardation, deafness, or lack of exposure. Congenital amusia is a condition that is estimated to affect 4% of the general population. Despite this relatively high prevalence, cases of congenital amusia have been difficult to identify. We present here a novel on-line test that can be used to identify such cases in 15 minutes, provided that the cohort of the participant is taken into account. The results also confirm that congenital amusia is typically expressed by a deficit in perceiving musical pitch but not musical time.

Musical tone-deafness (amusia) provides important evidence on this question. Amusics have problems with musical melody perception, yet early work suggested that they had no problems with the perception of speech intonation (Ayotte, Peretz, & Hyde, 2002). However, here we show that about 30% of amusics from independent studies (British and French-Canadian) have difficulty discriminating a statement from a question on the basis of a final pitch fall or rise. This suggests that pitch direction perception deficits in amusia (known from previous psychophysical work) can extend to speech. For British amusics, the direction deficit is related to the rate of change of the final pitch glide in statements/questions, with increased discrimination difficulty when rates are relatively slow. These findings suggest that amusia provides a useful window on the neural relations between melodic processing in language and music.

The battery was inspired by the brain damage literature on music-reading deficits and comprised visual and auditory tasks. Second, we report the battery data of IG, a university musician who was referred to us as potentially dyslexic for music, and also her data on text reading and neuropsychological tests. We compare IG's data with those of normal readers. We suggest that IG might represent a case of associated music and text developmental dyslexia. Her results also indicate a dissociation between her pitch and rhythm reading abilities not quite the same as normal readers, as well as an interesting dissociation between reading and repetition, opposite to normal readers.

Reversible hypogeusia during bilateral thalamic stimulation for essential tremor	NERVENARZT			German	Article						deep brain stimulation; essential tremor; hypogeusia; parageusia; thalamus	TASTE	Deep brain stimulation of ventral intermediate nucleus (VIM-DBS) has become an established therapy for severe essential tremor (ET). The technique is however limited in some ET patients by relevant side effects such as paresthesia, dysarthria, and gait disturbances. To our knowledge, this is the first report of VIM-DBS-induced reversible hypogeusia along with retroinsular cortical deactivation under effective VIM stimulation measured with 18-fluorodexoglucose positron emission tomography. This case demonstrates that gustatory dysfunction should be considered in the pre- and postsurgical management of patients with VIM-DBS. Moreover it provides direct evidence that the thalamus acts as an important relay station in the human cerebral gustatory pathway.

Abundant evidence suggests that sAPP alpha, the product of the non-amyloidogenic alpha-secretase pathway, is neurotrophic both in vitro and when exogenously applied in vivo. The disintegrin metalloprotease ADAM-10 has been shown to have a-secretase activity in vivo. To determine whether sAPPa. has an endogenous biological influence on cortical presynaptic boutons in vivo, we quantified cortical cholinergic, glutamatergic and GABAergic presynaptic bouton densities in either ADAM-10 moderate expressing (ADAM-10 mo) transgenic mice, which moderately overexpress ADAM-10, or age-matched non-transgenic controls. Both early and late ontogenic time points were investigated. ADAM-10 mo transgenic mice display significantly elevated cortical cholinergic, glutamatergic and GABAergic presynaptic bouton densities at the early time point (8 months). Only the cholinergic presynaptic bouton density remains significantly elevated in late-staged ADAM-10 mo transgenic animals (18 months). To confirm that the observed elevations were due to increased levels of endogenous murine sAPP(X, exogenous human sAPPa was infused into the cortex of non-transgenic control animals for 1 week. Exogenous infusion of sAPP alpha led to significant elevations in the cholinergic, glutamatergic and GABAergic cortical presynaptic bouton populations. These results are the first to demonstrate an in vivo influence of ADAM-10 on neurotransmitter-specific cortical synaptic plasticity and further confirm the neurotrophic influence of sAPPa on cortical synaptogenesis.

Here we report findings obtained in a case-control study that investigated possible effects of teratogens contained in cigarette smoke on the size and structural properties of this structure. We recruited and scanned with magnetic resonance imaging a total of 408 adolescents (12 to 18 years of age); a subsample of 300 adolescents is considered in this report. Cases (n=146) were exposed to maternal cigarette smoking during pregnancy; non-exposed controls (n=154) were matched to cases by maternal education. We measured the size of corpus callosum (CC) and its sections (corrected for brain size), as well as mean values of magnetization-transfer ratio (MTR) in each CC section. Corpus callosum, and especially its posterior part, was smaller in the exposed vs. non-exposed female adolescents; no significant effects were found in males. Exposed and non-exposed subjects did not differ in the MTR-based index of myelination in either gender in any CC section. Given the lack of exposure effect on the myelination index, this finding might reflect a lower number of inter-hemispheric connections in female offspring of mothers who smoked during pregnancy.

However, existing stereotaxic atlases lack comprehensive coordinate information about white matter structures. In this paper, white matter-specific atlases in stereotaxic coordinates are introduced. As a reference template, the widely used ICBM-152 was used. The atlas contains fiber orientation maps and hand-segmented white matter parcellation maps based on diffusion tensor imaging (DT1). Registration accuracy by linear and non-linear transformation was measured, and automated template-based white matter parcellation was tested. The results showed a high correlation between the manual ROI-based and the automated approaches for normal adult populations. The atlases are freely available and believed to be a useful resource as a target template and for automated parcellation methods. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Different patterns of BOLD responses have been observed in children as compared to adults. A high intra- and intersubject variability of the hemodynamic response function (HRF) to epileptic discharges has been observed in adults. The actual HRF to epileptic discharges in children and its dependence on age are unknown. We analyzed 64 EEG-fMRI event types in 37 children (3 months to 18 years), 92% showing a significant BOLD response. HRFs were calculated for each BOLD cluster using a Fourier basis set. After excluding HRFs with a low signal-to-noise ratio, 126 positive and 98 negative HRFs were analyzed. We evaluated age-dependent changes as well as the effect of increasing numbers of spikes. Peak time, amplitude and signal-to-noise ratio of the HRF and the t-statistic score of the cluster were used as dependent variables. We observed significantly longer peak times of the HRF in the youngest children (0 to 2 years), suggesting that the use of multiple HRFs might be important in this group. A different coupling between neuronal activity and metabolism or blood flow in young children may cause this phenomenon. Even if the t-value increased with frequent spikes, the amplitude of the HRF decreased significantly with spike frequency. This reflects a violation of the assumptions of the General Linear Model and therefore the use of alternative analysis techniques may be more appropriate with high spiking rates, a common situation in children.

In vivo DTI of the healthy and injured cat spinal cord at high spatial and angular resolution	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						spinal cord; thoracic; lumbar; injury; MRI; DTI; tractography	DIFFUSION-WEIGHTED MR; WHITE-MATTER; FIBER-TRACKING; WATER DIFFUSION; PULSE SEQUENCE; TENSOR; BRAIN; ECHO; TRACTOGRAPHY; COEFFICIENTS	Spinal cord diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is challenging in many ways: the small size of the cord, physiological motion and susceptibility artifacts pose daunting obstacles to the acquisition of high-quality data. Here, we present DTI results computed from in vivo studies of the healthy and injured spinal cord of five cats. Both high spatial (1.1 mm(3)) and angular (55 directions) resolutions were used to optimise modelling of the diffusion process. Also, particular effort was directed towards a strategy that limits susceptibility artifacts. For validation purposes, acquisitions were repeated in two cats before and after making a spinal lesion. As a result, various axonal trajectories were identified by tractography including dorsal and ventral columns as well as lateral tracts. Also, fibre bundles showed robust disruption at the site of spinal cord injuries (partial and complete) via tractography, accompanied with significantly lower fractional anisotropy values at the site of lesions. Important outcomes of this work are (i) tractography-based localisation of anatomical tracts in the thoracolumbar spinal cord and (ii) in vivo assessment of axonal integrity following experimental spinal cord injury.

However, to interact effectively with their environment, they have to rely on non-visual cues (in particular auditory) to a greater extent. Often benefiting from cerebral reorganization, they not only learn to rely more on such cues but also may process them better and, as a result, demonstrate exceptional abilities in auditory spatial tasks. Here we examine the effects of blindness on brain activity, using positron emission tomography (PET), during a sound-source discrimination task (SSDT) in both early- and late-onset blind individuals. This should not only provide an answer to the question of whether the blind manifest changes in brain activity but also allow a direct comparison of the two subgroups performing an auditory spatial task. The task was presented under two listening conditions: one binaural and one monaural. The binaural task did not show any significant behavioural differences between groups, but it demonstrated striate and extrastriate activation in the early-blind groups. A subgroup of early-blind individuals, on the other hand, performed significantly better than all the other groups during the monaural task, and these enhanced skills were correlated with elevated activity within the left dorsal extrastriate cortex. Surprisingly, activation of the right ventral visual pathway, which was significantly activated in the late-blind individuals during the monaural task, was negatively correlated with performance. This suggests the possibility that not all cross-modal plasticity is beneficial. Overall, our results not only support previous findings showing that occipital cortex of early-blind individuals is functionally engaged in spatial auditory processing but also shed light on the impact the age of onset of blindness can have on the ensuing cross-modal plasticity.

We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) to investigate the neurophysiological interactions between depressive symptoms and disease-relevant pain in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients. RA is associated with chronic joint pain and swelling, but peripheral joint pathology often does not fully explain the amount of pain a patient experiences. We investigated the neural circuitry that relates joint pain and depressive symptoms and contrasted this with experimental heat pain. We hypothesized that (1) depressive symptoms influence the cerebral processing of provoked joint pain in RA, and (2) the interaction of depressive symptoms with pain processing contributes to the pain RA patients experience on a daily basis. Twenty patients underwent whole brain FMRI during which disease-relevant joint pain was provoked. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). The tender-to-swollen joint ratio (T/S) was assessed as one component of the patients' clinical pain. BDI scores correlated significantly with T/S and medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) activation during provoked joint pain. The association between BDI scores and T/S was partly mediated by the MPFC activation. Furthermore, the MPFC activation co-varied significantly with the FMRI signal in limbic areas and in areas that process self-relevant information. These results suggest that the MPFC may play an important role in mediating the relationship between depressive symptoms and clinical pain severity in RA, possibly by engaging brain areas important for affective and self-relevant processing.

We measured thickness of the cerebral cortex using magnetic resonance images obtained in 155 adolescents exposed in utero to maternal smoking and compared them with 159 non-exposed subjects matched by maternal education. Orbitofrontal, middle frontal, and parahippocampal cortices were thinner in exposed, as compared with non-exposed, individuals; these differences were more pronounced in female adolescents. In exposed females, the thickness of the orbitofrontal cortex correlated negatively with a self-rated assessment of caring, one of the components of a model of positive youth development. These findings provide evidence of the long-term impact of prenatal environment on a neural substrate of cognition and social behavior.

In animal models of painful peripheral neuropathy due to nerve trauma or diabetes there is obvious axonal degeneration accompanied by an abnormal incidence of spontaneous discharge in A-fiber and C-fiber nociceptors. But animals with paclitaxel- and vincristine-evoked neuropathic pain do not have axonal degeneration at the level of the peripheral nerve. However, recent data show that they do have a partial degeneration of the primary afferent neurons' terminal arbors in the epidermis. It is not clear as to whether this relatively minor degeneration is accompanied by abnormal spontaneous discharge. We surveyed primary afferent axonal activity in the sural nerve of rats with the paclitaxel- and vincristine-evoked pain syndromes at the time of peak pain severity. Compared to vehicle-injected controls, we find a significant increase in spontaneously discharging A-fibers and C-fibers. Moreover, we show that prophylactic treatment with acetyl-L-carnitine (ALC), which blocks the development of the paclitaxel-evoked pain, causes a significant decrease (ca. 50%) in the incidence of A-fibers and C-fibers with spontaneous discharge. These results suggest that abnormal spontaneous afferent discharge is likely to be a factor in the pathogenesis of chemotherapy-evoked painful peripheral neuropathy, and that the therapeutic effects of ALC may be due to the suppression of this discharge.

Pen based interface combined with automatic handwriting recognition offers a very easy and natural input method. The handwritten signal is on-line collected via a digitizing device, and it is classified as one pre-specified set of characters. The main techniques applied in our work include two fields of research. The first one consists of the modeling system of handwriting. In this area, we developed a novel method of the handwritten trajectory modeling based on elliptic and Beta representation. The second part of our work shows the implementation of a classifier consisting of the Multi-Layers Perception of Neural Networks (MLPNN) developed in a fuzzy concept. The training process of the recognition system is based on an association of the Self Organization Maps (SOM) with Fuzzy K-Nearest Neighbor Algorithms (FKNNA). To test the performance of our system we build 30,000 Arabic digits. The global recognition rate obtained by our recognition system is about 95.08%. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Only a few cases have been reported in the literature. In the last 25 years, we have seen seven patients affected by congenital axonal neuropathy with encephalopathy. Biopsies of their sural nerves revealed axonal atrophy and loss of large-diameter nerve fibers. All of these patients presented at birth or soon thereafter with hypotonia associated with distal weakness and diffuse areflexia. Central nervous system manifestations included microcephaly, seizures, and developmental delay. Outcomes were poor. Four children died before age 3 years from respiratory insufficiency or aspiration pneumonia. The three surviving patients manifested severe developmental delay. In our most recent patient, Western-blot analysis of snap-frozen specimens of the temporal and cerebellar cortex demonstrated an absence or marked decrease of microtubule-associated protein types 1A and 2, compared with age-matched control subjects. Calloso-splenial hypogenesis and neurofilament swellings were also documented in the deep white matter and adjacent cortex. The absence or hypo-expression of central nervous system microtubule-associated proteins has never been reported in congenital neuropathies, and may represent a new clinicopathologic entity.

The survival of very low birth weight infants has increased markedly in recent years. Unfortunately, the prevalence of significant and lifelong motor, cognitive, and behavioral dysfunction has remained a major problem confronting these children. The objective of this study was to perform screening tests for early autistic features in children with a history of very low birth weight and to identify risk factors associated with a positive screening result. METHODS. We studied 91 ex-preterm infants <= 1500 g at birth. Infants underwent conventional MRI studies at preterm and/or term-adjusted age. We collected pertinent demographic, prenatal, intrapartum, acute postnatal, and short-term outcome data for all infants. Follow-up assessments were performed at a mean age of 21.9 +/- 4.7 months, using the Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers, the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale, and the Child Behavior Checklist. RESULTS. Twenty-six percent of ex-preterm infants had a positive result on the autism screening tool. Abnormal scores correlated highly with internalizing behavioral problems on the Child Behavior Checklist and socialization and communication deficits on the Vineland Scales. Lower birth weight, gestational age, male gender, chorioamnionitis, acute intrapartum hemorrhage, illness severity on admission, and abnormal MRI studies were significantly associated with an abnormal autism screening score. CONCLUSIONS. Early autistic behaviors seem to be an underrecognized feature of very low birth weight infants. The results from this study suggest that early screening for signs of autism may be warranted in this high-risk population followed by definitive autism testing in those with positive screening results.

DAS SC perfectionism measures, along with personal standards (i.e., self-oriented perfectionism) and other SC (i.e., socially prescribed perfectionism, self-criticism) measures of perfectionism, were related to the five domains and 30 facets of the revised NEO Personality Inventory (NEO-PlR; Costa et al., 1992) and current depressive symptoms. Results indicated that DAS SC perfectionism was similar to socially prescribed perfectionism and self-criticism primarily in terms of moderate to large correlations with depressive symptoms and the neuroticism domain and facets, and negative correlations with the warmth, positive emotions, and trust facets. DAS SC/defensive separation perfectionism (i.e., DAS SC perfectionism with shared variance related to DAS need for approval removed) exhibited negative correlations with warmth and trust but was not related to neuroticism. In contrast to self-oriented perfectionism, the DAS SC perfectionism measures were unrelated or negatively related to the conscientiousness facets. These results suggest that DAS SC perfectionism more closely reflects self-critical than personal standards dimensions of perfectionism. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Influence of comorbid obsessive-compulsive symptoms on brain event-related potentials in Gilles de la Tourette syndrome	PROGRESS IN NEURO-PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY & BIOLOGICAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Review						comorbidity; obsessive-compulsive disorder; oddball effect; P200; P300; Tourette syndrome	HUNTINGTONS-DISEASE; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; ODDBALL PARADIGM; P300 AMPLITUDE; TELL US; DISORDER; DEPRESSION; ATTENTION; DYSFUNCTION; TASK	Approximately 30 to 50% of people suffering from Gilles de la Tourette Syndrome (GTS) also fulfill diagnostic criteria for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Despite this high degree of comorbidity, very few studies have addressed the question of obsessive-compulsive symptoms (OCS) in GTS patients using specific brain event-related potentials (ERP) responses. The aim of the current study was to quantify neurocognitive aspects of comorbidity, using ERPs. Fourteen adults with GTS (without OCD) were compared to a group of 12 participants with GTS and comorbid obsessive-compulsive symptoms (GTS+OCS), to a group of 15 participants with OCD and to a group of 14 control participants without neurological or psychiatric problems. The P200 and P300 components were recorded during a visual counting oddball task. Results showed intact P200 amplitude in all groups, whilst the P300 amplitude was affected differentially across groups. The P300 oddball effect was reduced in participants in both OCD and GTS + OCS groups in the anterior region. However, the P300 oddball effect was significantly larger in participants of the GTS group compared to all other groups, mostly in the parietal region. These findings suggest that adults with GTS are characterized by enhanced working memory updating processes and that the superimposition of OCS can lead to a reduction of these processes. The discrepancy between our findings and results obtained in previous studies on GTS could reflect the modulating effect of OCS on late ERP components. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Autosomal dominant mutations in the progranulin gene cause frontotemporal dementia, while overexpression of progranulin promotes the invasive progression of a range of tumors, including those of the breast and the brain. Structurally, progranulin consists of seven-and-a-half tandem repeats of the granulin/epithelin module ( GEM), several of which have been isolated as discrete 6-kDa GEM peptides. We have expressed all seven human GEMs using recombinant DNA in Escherichia coli. High-resolution NMR showed that only the three GEMs, hGrnA, hGrnC, and hGrnF, contain relatively well-defined three-dimensional structures in solution, while others are mainly mixtures of poorly structured disulfide isomers. The three-dimensional structures of hGrnA, hGrnC, and hGrnF contain a stable stack of two beta-hairpins in their N-terminal subdomains, but showed a more flexible C-terminal subdomain. Interestingly, of the well-structured GEMs, hGrnA demonstrated potent growth inhibition of a breast cancer cell line, while hGrnF was stimulatory. Poorly folded peptides were either weakly inhibitory or without activity. The functionally active and structurally well-characterized human hGrnA offers a unique opportunity for detailed structure-function studies of these important GEM proteins as novel members of mammalian growth factors.

Our study sought to determine whether head injury causes an immediate impairment of the splanchnic circulation which may contribute to later GI sequelae. Methods: Three groups of eight rats each received either no closed head trauma (CHT) (group 1) or CHT (groups 2 and 3) immediately following baseline measurements at time 0. The primary measures of interest - individual organ blood flows and cardiac output (radioactive microspheres), and individual organ and systemic vascular resistances - were determined in the control group, at 5 min after CHT in group 2, and at 15 min after CHT in group 3. Results: CHT caused no significant change in portal venous inflow (flows were 2.40 +/- 0.36, 2.38 +/- 0.54, and 2.33 +/- 0.62 ml min(-1) 100 g(-1) bw, mean +/- S. D., in groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively). Individual organ and total hepatic blood flow, cardiac index, splanchnic, portal, and total peripheral resistance, and mean arterial or portal venous pressure also did not differ significantly among groups. Conclusion: We found no significant changes in splanchnic circulation immediately after CHT in this rat model. Our results do not support the hypothesis that the splanchnic circulation is impaired immediately after head injury and that splanchnic blood flow impairment immediately after head injury may contribute to post-head injury GI dysfunction.

Recent NMR studies of SLV demonstrated that magnesium ions stabilize a U-turn loop structure and trigger a conformational change for the extruded loop residue U700, suggesting a role for U700 in SLI recognition. Here, we kinetically characterized VS ribozyme mutants to evaluate the contribution of U700 and other SLV loop residues to SLI recognition. To help interpret the kinetic data, we structurally characterized the SLV mutants by NMR spectroscopy and generated a three-dimensional model of the SLI/SLV complex by homology modeling with MC-Sym. We demonstrated that the mutation of U700 by A, C, or G does not significantly affect ribozyme activity, whereas deletion of U700 dramatically impairs this activity. The U700 backbone is likely important for SLI recognition, but does not appear to be required for either the structural integrity of the SLV loop or for direct interactions with SLI. Thus, deletion of U700 may affect other aspects of SLI recognition, such as magnesium ion binding and SLV loop dynamics. As part of our NMR studies, we developed a convenient assay based on detection of unusual P-31 and N-15 N7 chemical shifts to probe the formation of U-turn structures in RNAs. Our model of the SLI/SLV complex, which is compatible with biochemical data, leads us to propose novel interactions at the loop I/loop V interface.

Comparative analysis of the frequency and distribution of stem and progenitor cells in the adult mouse brain	STEM CELLS			English	Article						neural stem cell; precursor; bromodeoxyuridine; label-retaining cell; neurosphere	CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; NEURAL STEM; SUBVENTRICULAR ZONE; MAMMALIAN FOREBRAIN; SUBEPENDYMAL CELLS; SIDE-POPULATION; OLFACTORY-BULB; HAIR-FOLLICLES; PROLIFERATION; NEURONS	The neurosphere assay can detect and expand neural stem cells (NSCs) and progenitor cells, but it cannot discriminate between these two populations. Given two assays have purported to overcome this shortfall, we performed a comparative analysis of the distribution and frequency of NSCs and progenitor cells detected in 400 mu m coronal segments along the ventricular neuraxis of the adult mouse brain using the neurosphere assay, the neural colony forming cell assay (N-CFCA), and label-retaining cell (LRC) approach. We observed a large variation in the number of progenitor/stem cells detected in serial sections along the neuraxis, with the number of neurosphere-forming cells detected in individual 400 mu m sections varying from a minimum of eight to a maximum of 891 depending upon the rostral-caudal coordinate assayed. Moreover, the greatest variability occurred in the rostral portion of the lateral ventricles, thereby explaining the large variation in neurosphere frequency previously reported. Whereas the overall number of neurospheres (3730 +/- 276) or colonies (4275 +/- 124) we detected along the neuraxis did not differ significantly, LRC numbers were significantly reduced (1186 +/- 188, 7 month chase) in comparison to both total colonies and neurospheres. Moreover, approximately two orders of magnitude fewer NSC-derived colonies (50 +/- 10) were detected using the N-CFCA as compared to LRCs. Given only 5% of the LRCs are cycling (BrdU(+)/Ki-67(+)) or competent to divide (BrdU(+)/Mcm-2(+)), and proliferate upon transfer to culture, it is unclear whether this technique selectively detects endogenous NSCs. Overall, caution should be taken with the interpretation and employment of all these techniques.

These data challenge current rehabilitative assumptions and emphasize the need for neuroplasticity-principled exercise-based approaches to challenge the impaired system. We suggest one novel solution-the intensive practice of amplitude-a global motor control parameter. Training a single focus (amplitude) across (1) disciplines (physical, occupational, speech therapy), (2) tasks (transfers, activities of daily living, recreation), and (3) motor systems (speech, locomotion, reaching) may provide the complexity, difficulty, and repetition necessary for disease-modification in human Parkinson disease.

Alternatively, memories might consist of distinct molecular traces that last for different periods of time. These traces can be graded by their 'volatility'; traces encoded by activation of protein kinases are more volatile than traces encoded by morphological changes at preexisting synapses. The least volatile ('static') traces are due to the generation and stabilization of new synapses. Importantly, whereas at the cellular level these traces are generated independently of each other, they might be linked at the network level where volatile memory traces are required to set up a cellular network that is in turn required to induce the static memory trace.

Spatial properties of curvature-encoding mechanisms revealed through the shape-frequency and shape-amplitude after-effects	VISION RESEARCH			English	Article						contour-shape; curvature; adaptation; after-effect; opponent; polarity	INFERIOR TEMPORAL CORTEX; PRIMARY VISUAL-CORTEX; CONTOUR CURVATURE; AREA V4; RECEPTIVE-FIELD; MACAQUE MONKEY; INFEROTEMPORAL CORTEX; CARTESIAN GRATINGS; EARLY COMPUTATION; PART STRUCTURE	The shape-frequency and shape-amplitude after-effects, or SFAE and SAAE, are phenomena in which adaptation to a sinusoidal-shaped contour results in a shift in, respectively, the perceived shape-frequency and perceived shape-amplitude of a test contour in a direction away from that of the adapting stimulus. Recent evidence shows that the SFAE and SAAE are mediated by mechanisms sensitive to curvature [Gheorghiu, E., & Kingdom, F. A. A. (2007a). The spatial feature underlying the shape-frequency and shape-amplitude after-effects. Vision Research, 47(6), 834-844]. Therefore we have used the SFAE and SAAE as a tool to study curvature processing. We examined whether curvature-encoding mechanisms are selective for (i) shape-phase, (ii) curvature polarity (or sign) and (iii) local orientation. We also investigated whether (iv) the two orthogonal dimensions of a curve, the sag and the cord, are encoded independently, and (v) whether curvature encoders are organized in an opponent manner. SFAEs/SAAEs were measured for adapting and test contours that differed or not in a given spatial property, the rationale being that if the after-effects were smaller when adaptor and test differed in a particular spatial property then curvature-encoding mechanisms must be selective for that spatial property. Our results reveal that SFAEs and SAAEs show (i) a degree of selectivity to curves that are mirror symmetric (in our stimuli half-cycle sine-wave contours in cosine (0/180 deg) shape-phase); (ii) a degree of selectivity to the sign or polarity of curvature; (iii) a degree of selectivity to local orientation; (iv) independent coding of the sag and the cord of the curve, and (v) no evidence for opponent-curvature coding. The results agree with neurophysiological studies showing that simple shape dimensions are encoded independently. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Gheorghiu, Elena; Kingdom, Frederick A.

The effectiveness of standard analgesic drugs to attenuate mechanical allodynia was assessed 2 and 7 days after ischemia/reperfusion. Only high doses of morphine, dexamethasone and pregabalin partially reduced mechanical allodynia 2 days post-ischemia/reperfusion, while other treatments (ibuprofen, acetaminophen, amitriptyline) were not effective. Furthermore, only the highest dose of pregabalin reduced mechanical allodynia 7 days post-ischemia/reperfusion. These results are consistent with findings that complex region pain syndrome-I pain is refractory to most standard analgesic treatments. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Feldman, AG				Feldman, Anatol G.			Threshold position control signifies a common spatial frame of reference for motor action and kinesthesia	BRAIN RESEARCH BULLETIN			English	Editorial Material						position sence; action-perception coupling; muscle spindles; gamma-innervation; motor control; efference copy; spatial frames of reference	STRETCH REFLEX; AFFERENT; HYPOTHESIS; CAT	Abundance of muscle spindles is most likely related to gradual recruitment and functional specialization of motor units, as well as to their fundamental role in reflex intermuscular interaction and cooperation with other sensory systems. Spindle afferents per se usually convey ambiguous kinesthetic information to the brain. Experimental data indicate that the nervous system cannot use efferent copies, i.e., pre-programmed imitations of motor commands to muscles to overcome this ambiguity and form adequate position sense. Instead, position sense becomes adequate when proprioceptive signals are interpreted in reference to the threshold limb position set by the brain. By resetting the threshold position, the nervous system not only appropriately adjusts kinesthetic sense but also causes motor action. This brief analysis illustrates not only that action and perception are coupled [J.J. Gibson, The Senses Considered as Perceptual Systems. George Allen and Unwin Ltd., London, 1968; W.H. Warren, The dynamics of perception and action. Psychol. Rev. 113 (2006) 358-89] but also that they are accomplished in the same spatial frame of reference selected and manipulated by the brain.

The objective of the present investigation was to assess open field (OF) activity and the brain regional 5-HT1A receptor densities of the sham operated (SHX) and OBX rats treated with saline (SHX-SAL, OBX-SAL), and either 10mg/(kg day) (SHX-B10, OBX-B10) or 20 mg/(kg day) (SHX-B20, OBX-B20) of buspirone for 14 days, delivered by a subcutaneous osmotic minipump. Adult Sprague-Dawley rats were used for this experiment. The surgery was performed on the first day of the experiment and the rats were randomly assigned to either the SHX or OBX groups. The results of the OF tests were organized in eight groups. Following 14 days of treatment and the final OF tests, the rats were sacrificed and the brains were used for 5-HT1A receptor autoradiography using [H-3]8-OH-DPAT. The data showed that the OF activities, 14 days following surgery, in the OBX rats were significantly elevated when compared to the SHX rats. In the OBX rats, only the 14-day treatment with 20 mg/(kg day) of buspirone normalized the elevated OF activity, the same dose shown previously to be needed for the normalization of the regional 5-HT synthesis. A significant reduction in the number of 5-HT1A receptor sites was found in most brain regions in the OBX rats when compared to the SHX rats. Data also show that the regional density of the 5-HT1A receptors in OBX-SAL treated rats is lower than that of the SHX-SAL rats. The 14-day treatment with either 10 or 20 mg/(kg day) of buspirone reduced the 5-HT1A receptors in most brain regions of the SHX rats, without an obvious dose-dependent effect of the buspirone. The comparison between the OBX-B20 and control (SHX-B20) rats suggests that the buspirone treatment resulted in a regional balance in the 5-HT1A sites. A dose dependent reduction in the density of 5-HT1A sites was observed in the sham rats, but the buspirone treatment had very little effect on the density of the 5-HT1A receptors in the OBX rats. From these observations, we conclude that the antidepressant effects of buspirone in the OBX rat model of depression are likely mediated through the fine tuning of the regional imbalance of 5-HT1A receptors with even increases of about 20% in some limbic regions. The data suggest that the neurochemical effects of antidepressants should be studied in animal models of depression rather than in normal rats. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Acupuncture analgesia is a very useful clinical skill for pain relief, which has over 2500-year history in China. The present study investigated the effect of SON on acupuncture analgesia in the rat. Electrical stimulation of the SON or microinjection of a small dose L-glutamate sodium into the SON enhanced acupuncture analgesia in a dose-dependent manner, while cauterization of the SON weakened acupuncture analgesia. Pituitary removal did not influence the effect Of L-glutamate sodium that enhanced acupuncture analgesia in the SON. The data suggested that the neurons and not the nerve fibers in the SON played an important role in acupuncture analgesia, which effect might be through the central nervous system rather than the hypothalamo-neurohypophyseal system.

Role of the dorsal paragigantocellular reticular nucleus in paradoxical (rapid eye movement) sleep generation: A combined electrophysiological and anatomical study in the rat	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						unanesthetized head-restrained rat; electrophysiology; tract-tracing; locus coeruleus; rapid eye movements; monoamines	LOCUS-COERULEUS; REM-SLEEP; WAKING CYCLE; NORADRENERGIC NEURONS; PREPOSITUS-HYPOGLOSSI; AFFERENT-PROJECTIONS; GABAERGIC NEURONS; BRAIN; GABA; DISCHARGE	It is well known that noradrenergic locus coeruleus neurons decrease their activity during slow wave sleep and are quiescent during paradoxical sleep. It was recently proposed that their inactivation during paradoxical sleep is due to a tonic GABAergic inhibition arising from neurons located into the dorsal paragigantocellular reticular nucleus (DPGi). However, the discharge profile of DPGi neurons across the sleep-waking cycle as well as their connections with brain areas involved in paradoxical sleep regulation remain to be described. Here we show, for the first time in the unanesthetized rat that the DPGi contained a subtype of neurons with a tonic and sustained firing activation specifically during paradoxical sleep (PS-on neurons). Noteworthy, their firing rate increase anticipated for few seconds the beginning of the paradoxical sleep bout. By using anterograde tract-tracing, we further showed that the DPGi, in addition to locus coeruleus, directly projected to other areas containing wake-promoting neurons such as the serotonergic neurons of the dorsal raphe nucleus and hypocretinergic neurons of the posterior hypothalamus. Finally, the DPGi sent efferents to the ventrolateral part of the periaqueductal gray matter known to contain paradoxical sleep-suppressing neurons. Taken together, our original results suggest that the PS-on neurons of the DPGi may have their major role in simultaneous inhibitory control over the wake-promoting neurons and the permissive ventrolateral part of the periaqueductal gray matter as a means of influencing vigilance states and especially PS generation.

Diagnosis	CANADIAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION JOURNAL			English	Review							MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; MINI-MENTAL-STATE; CANADIAN-CONSENSUS-CONFERENCE; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; VASCULAR DEMENTIA; SCREENING-TEST; DIFFERENTIAL-DIAGNOSIS; REVERSIBLE DEMENTIAS; CEREBROSPINAL-FLUID; OLDER-PEOPLE	Background: Dementia can now be accurately diagnosed through clinical evaluation, cognitive screening, basic laboratory evaluation and structural imaging. A large number of ancillary techniques are also available to aid in diagnosis, but their role in the armamentarium of family physicians remains controversial. In this article, we provide physicians with practical guidance on the diagnosis of dementia based on recommendations from the Third Canadian Consensus Conference on the Diagnosis and Treatment of Dementia, held in March 2006. Methods: We developed evidence-based guidelines using systematic literature searches, with specific criteria for study selection and quality assessment, and a clear and transparent decision-making process. We selected studies published from January 1996 to December 2005 that pertained to key diagnostic issues in dementia. We graded the strength of evidence using the criteria of the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care. Results: Of the 1591 articles we identified on all aspects of dementia diagnosis, 1095 met our inclusion criteria; 620 were deemed to be of good or fair quality. From a synthesis of the evidence in these studies, we made 32 recommendations related to the diagnosis of dementia. There are clinical criteria for diagnosing most forms of dementia. A standard diagnostic evaluation can be performd by family physicians over multiple visits. It involves a clinical history ( from patient and caregiver), a physical examination and brief cognitive testing. A list of core laboratory tests is recommended. Structural imaging with computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging is recommended in selected cases to rule out treatable causes of dementia or to rule in cerebrovascular disease. There is insufficient evidence to recommend routine functional imaging, measurement of biomarkers or neuro-psychologic testing. Interpretation: The diagnosis of dementia remains clinically integrative based on history, physical examination and brief cognitive testing. A number of core laboratory tests are also recommended. Structural neuroimaging is advised in selected cases. Other diagnostic approaches, including functional neuroimaging, neuropsychological testing and measurement of biomarkers, have shown promise but are not yet recommended for routine use by family physicians.

Reversal of cardiac dysfunction after long-term expression of SERCA2a by gene transfer in a pre-clinical model of heart failure	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF CARDIOLOGY			English	Article							SARCOPLASMIC-RETICULUM CA2+-ATPASE; ADENOASSOCIATED VIRUS VECTORS; IN-VIVO; DILATED CARDIOMYOPATHY; REPLICATION-DEFICIENT; MYOCARDIAL-INFARCTION; MITRAL REGURGITATION; ADENOVIRUS VECTORS; PORCINE MYOCARDIUM; CALCIUM-ATPASE	Objectives The aim of this study was to examine the effects of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA2a) gene transfer in a swine heart failure (HF) model. Background Reduced expression and activity of SERCA2a have been documented in HF. Prior studies have reported the beneficial effects of short-term SERCA2a overexpression in rodent models. However, the effects of long-term expression of SERCA2a in pre-clinical large animal models are not known. Methods Yorkshire-Landrace pigs were used (n = 16) to create volume overload by percutaneously severing chordae tendinae of the mitral apparatus with a bioptome to induce mitral regurgitation. At 2 months, pigs underwent intracoronary delivery of either recombinant adeno-associated virus type 1 (rAAV1) carrying SERCA2a under a cytomegalovirus promoter (rAAV1.SERCA2a) (n = 10; group 1) or saline (n = 6; group 2). Results At 2 months, study animals were found to be in a compensated state of volume-overload HF (increased left ventricular internal diastolic and systolic diameters [LVIDd and LVIDs]). At 4 months, gene transfer resulted in: 1) positive left ventricular (LV) inotropic effects (adjusted peak left ventricular pressure rate of rise (dP/dt)max/P, 21.2 +/- 3.2 s(-1) group 1 vs. 15.5 +/- 3.0 s(-1) group 2; p < 0.01); 2) improvement in LV remodeling (% change in LVIDs -3.0 +/- 10% vs. +15 +/- 11%, respectively; p < 0.01). At follow-up, brain natriuretic peptide levels remained stable in group I after gene transfer, in contrast to rising levels in group 2. Further, cardiac SERCA2a expression was significantly decreased in group 2 whereas in group 1 it was restored to normal levels. There was no histopathological evidence of acute myocardial inflammation or necrosis. Conclusions Using a large-animal, volume-overload model of HF, we report that long-term overexpression of SERCA2a by in vivo rAAV1-mediated intracoronary gene transfer preserved systolic function, potentially prevented diastolic dysfunction, and improved ventricular remodeling.

In this study, we investigated the ability of S. suis mutant strain (SRT Delta A) lacking the sortase A gene (srtA) to interact with host cells and extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, as well as its virulence in a mouse infection model. We demonstrated that mutant SRT Delta A had reduced capacity to adhere to and invade porcine brain microvascular endothelial cells compared to the wild-type strain. In addition, mutant SRT Delta A also showed significantly less adherence to plasma fibronectin, cellular fibronectin and collagen type I. However, disruption of srtA had little effect on the virulence of S. suis in a mouse intraperitoneal model of infection. These results indicate that surface proteins anchored by sortase A are required for a normal level of bacterial binding. However, other factors may also be important for S. suis virulence and interaction with host tissues. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Vanier, G.; Dominguez-Punaro, M.

In contrast, neurochemical measurements of DA tone have failed to reveal an influence of reward predictability. However, the subjects of the neurochemical experiments were asked to predict reward onset over longer intervals (12 s, on average) than the subjects of the electrophysiological studies (typically, 2 s). Thus, the contrasting effects of reward predictability could reflect the difference in the duration of the interval separating the predictor from the reward rather than a difference in the influence of reward predictability on phasic and tonic DA signaling. This hypothesis was tested in rats receiving trains of rewarding electrical brain stimulation with either a predictable or unpredictable onset. The mean inter-train interval was 1.5 s, a value close to the 2-s CS-US interval that has been used in electrophysiological studies demonstrating the dependence of phasic DA responses on reward predictability. Despite the shortened inter-train interval, the time courses of the observed stimulation-induced elevations in DA levels were very similar, regardless of whether train onset was predictable. This finding is consistent with the idea that tonic DA signaling is insensitive to the predictability of rewards. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A major advancement would be to link therapeutic drugs to SPIONs in order to achieve targeted drug delivery combined with detection. In the present work, we studied the possibility of developing a versatile synthesis protocol to hierarchically construct drug-functionalized-SPIONs as potential anti-cancer agents. Our model biocompatible SPIONs consisted of an iron oxide core (9-10 nm diameter) coated with polyvinylalcohols (PVA/aminoPVA), which can be internalized by cancer cells, depending on the positive charges at their surface. To develop drug-functionalized-aminoPVA-SPIONs as vectors for drug delivery, we first designed and synthesized bifunctional linkers of varied length and chemical composition to which the anti-cancer drugs 5-fluorouridine or doxorubicin were attached as biologically labile esters or peptides, respectively. These functionalized linkers were in turn coupled to aminoPVA by amide linkages before preparing the drug-functionalized-SPIONs that were characterized and evaluated as anti-cancer agents using human melanoma cells in culture. The 5-fluorouridine-SPIONs with an optimized ester linker were taken up by cells and proved to be efficient anti-tumor agents. While the doxorubicin-SPIONs linked with a Gly-Phe-Leu-Gly tetrapeptide were cleaved by lysosomal enzymes, they exhibited poor uptake by human melanoma cells in culture. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Recently, axons of motoneurons and mechanosensory neurons in adult C. elegans were found to regrow after being snipped by femtosecond laser ablation. Here, we explore the molecular determinants of adult-stage axon regeneration using the AVM mechanosensory neurons. The first step in AVM axon development is a pioneer axonal projection from the cell body to the ventral nerve cord. We show that regeneration of the AVM axon to the ventral nerve cord lacks the deterministic precision of initial axon development, requiring competition and pruning of unwanted axon branches. Nevertheless, axons of injured AVM neurons regrow to the ventral nerve cord with over 60% reliability in adult animals. In addition, in contrast to initial development, axon guidance during regeneration becomes heavily dependent on cytoplasmic protein MIG-10/Lamellipodin but independent of UNC-129/TGF-beta repellent and UNC-40/DCC receptor, and axon growth during regeneration becomes heavily dependent on UNC-34/Ena and CED-10/Rac actin regulators. Thus, C. elegans may be used as a genetic system to characterize novel cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying adult-stage nervous system regeneration.

Age-related differences in brain activity during verbal recency memory	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						fMRI; aging; prefrontal cortex; episodic memory; recency memory	EVENT-RELATED FMRI; PARTIAL LEAST-SQUARES; RIGHT PREFRONTAL CORTEX; EPISODIC MEMORY; WORKING-MEMORY; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; RECOGNITION MEMORY; TEMPORAL-LOBE; COGNITIVE CONTROL; CORTICAL ACTIVITY	In the current event-related fMRI study young and older adults underwent fMRI scanning while performing recognition, recency and reverse alphabetizing tasks. The reverse alphabetizing task served as a control for executive processes, such as working memory manipulation and monitoring (Henson, R.N., Shallice, T., et al., 1999. Right prefrontal cortex and episodic memory retrieval: a functional MRI test of the monitoring hypothesis. Brain 122 (Pt 7), 1367-1381; Dobbins, I.G., Schnyer, D.M., et al., 2004a. Cortical activity reductions during repetition priming can result from rapid response learning. Nature 428 (6980), 316-319; Rajah, M.N., McIntosh, A.R., 2006. Dissociating prefrontal contributions during a recency memory task. Neuropsychologia 44 (3), 350-364). Multivariate spatio-temporal partial least squares (ST-PLS) analysis was used to identify task-related similarities and differences in regional activity in young versus older adults. The behavioural results indicated that older adults performed disproportionately worse on recency, but not recognition memory, compared to young adults. The fMRI results show the older adults activated right parahippocampal, right parietal, left precuneus and right prefrontal regions to a greater degree during both recognition and recency retrieval, compared to young adults. Brain-behaviour correlation analysis showed that increased activity in right parahippocampal and parietal cortex was related to poorer retrieval performance in older adults, but was related to improved recency accuracy and reverse alphabetizing accuracy in young adults, respectively. In contrast, the age-related increase in right prefrontal. and left precuneus activity was related to improved recognition, but not recency, performance in older adults. In young adults, activity in these regions was not strongly related to retrieval performance. These results suggest that older adults exhibited deficits in medial temporal and parietal function during retrieval, which was functionally compensated for by increased recruitment of prefrontal and precuneus regions. This functional compensation was sufficient for maintaining recognition but not recency retrieval in older adults.	[Rajah, M.

Neural specializations for speech and pitch: moving beyond the dichotomies	PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Review						hemispheric specialization; functional neuroimaging; tone languages	HUMAN AUDITORY-CORTEX; CROSS-LINGUISTIC PET; LANGUAGE EXPERIENCE; TEMPORAL-LOBE; HUMAN BRAIN; TONE PERCEPTION; SIGN-LANGUAGE; HEMISPHERIC-SPECIALIZATION; FUNCTIONAL NEUROANATOMY; CATEGORICAL PERCEPTION	The idea that speech processing relies on unique, encapsulated, domain-specific mechanisms has been around for some time. Another well-known idea, often espoused as being in opposition to the first proposal, is that processing of speech sounds entails general-purpose neural mechanisms sensitive to the acoustic features that are present in speech. Here, we suggest that these dichotomous views need not be mutually exclusive. Specifically, there is now extensive evidence that spectral and temporal acoustical properties predict the relative specialization of right and left auditory cortices, and that this is a parsimonious way to account not only for the processing of speech sounds, but also for non-speech sounds such as musical tones. We also point out that there is equally compelling evidence that neural responses elicited by speech sounds can differ depending on more abstract, linguistically relevant properties of a stimulus (such as whether it forms part of one's language or not). Tonal languages provide a particularly valuable window to understand the interplay between these processes. The key to reconciling these phenomena probably lies in understanding the interactions between afferent pathways that carry stimulus information, with top-down processing mechanisms that modulate these processes. Although we are still far from the point of having a complete picture, we argue that moving forward will require us to abandon the dichotomy argument in favour of a more integrated approach.

Human cerebral response to animal affective vocalizations	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						emotion; voice; conspecific vocalizations; functional magnetic resonance imaging; limbic system; auditory cortex	NEURAL REPRESENTATIONS; ORBITOFRONTAL CORTEX; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; EMOTION; VALENCE; MOTIVATION; INTENSITY; ATTENTION; AMYGDALA; AROUSAL	It is presently unknown whether our response to affective vocalizations is specific to those generated by humans or more universal, triggered by emotionally matched vocalizations generated by other species. Here, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging in normal participants to measure cerebral activity during auditory stimulation with affectively valenced animal vocalizations, some familiar ( cats) and others not ( rhesus monkeys). Positively versus negatively valenced vocalizations from cats and monkeys elicited different cerebral responses despite the participants' inability to differentiate the valence of these animal vocalizations by overt behavioural responses. Moreover, the comparison with human non-speech affective vocalizations revealed a common response to the valence in orbitofrontal cortex, a key component on the limbic system. These findings suggest that the neural mechanisms involved in processing human affective vocalizations may be recruited by heterospecific affective vocalizations at an unconscious level, supporting claims of shared emotional systems across species.

It is commonly seen in elderly affecting the head, neck, and extremities. Macroscopically may be difficult to distinguish MCC from other small cells neoplasms especially oat cell carcinoma of the lung. Case presentation: It is presented a case report concerning a 72 years old male with a MMC on the dorsal aspect of the right wrist. The patient underwent a diagnostic excisional biopsy and after the histological confirmation of the diagnosis a second excision was performed to achieve free margins. No postoperative radiation or adjuvant chemotherapy was given and within 9 years follow up no recurrence was reported. Conclusion: Although most cases present as localized disease treatment should be definitive due to high rates of local or systemic recurrence. Treatment includes excision of the lesion, lymphadenectomy, postoperative radiotherapy and chemotherapy depending on the stage of the disease. Even when locoregional control is achieved close surveillance is required due to high rates of relapse.

We show that gene silencing of MT1-MMP or G6PT decreased the extent of SIP-induced Ca(2+) mobilization, chemotaxis, and extracellular signal-related kinase phosphorylation. Chlorogenic acid and (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate, two diet-derived inhibitors of G6PT and of MT1-MMP, respectively, reduced SIP-mediated Ca(2+) mobilization. An intact MT1-MMP/G6PT signaling axis is thus required for efficient Ca(2+) mobilization in response to bioactive lipids such as SIP. Targeted inhibition of either MT1-MMP or G6PT may lead to reduced infiltrative and invasive properties of brain tumor cells. (c) 2008 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.

Speech movements offer an unusual opportunity to test this proposal by means of an examination of transfer of learning between utterances that are to varying degrees matched on kinematics. If speech learning results in a generalizable dynamics representation, then, at the least, learning should transfer when similar movements are embedded in phonetically distinct utterances. We tested this idea using three different pairs of training and transfer utterances that substantially overlap kinematically. We find that, with these stimuli, speech learning is highly contextually sensitive and fails to transfer even to utterances that involve very similar movements. Speech learning appears to be extremely local, and the specificity of learning is incompatible with the idea that speech control involves a generalized dynamics representation.

Recently, we have documented independent association of Vangl1 and Vangl2 gene mutations with NTDs. In the Looptail mouse, homozygosity (but not heterozygosity) for loss-of-function alleles at Vangl2 causes the severe NTD craniorachischisis, whereas heterozygosity for mutant variants of VANGL1 is associated with NTDs in a human cohort of sporadic and familial cases. To understand the role of Vangl1 in normal development, we created a mouse mutant with an inactivating mutation at Vangl1 (Vangl1(gt)). Vangl1 shows a dynamic pattern of expression in the developing neural tube and notochord at the time of neural tube closure. Vangl1(gt/+) heterozygotes and Vangl1(gt/gt) homozygotes are viable and fertile, although Vangl1(gt/gt) display subtle alterations in polarity of inner hair cells of the cochlea. Remarkably, and as opposed to healthy Vangl1(gt/+) and Vangl2(lp/+) heterozygotes, Vangl1(gt/+);Vangl2(lp/+) double heterozygotes show profound developmental defects that include severe craniorachischisis, inner ear defects (disorganization of the stereociliary bundles of hair cells of the organ of Corti), and cardiac abnormality (aberrant right subclavian artery). These results show that genetic interaction between Vangl1(gt/+) and Vangl2(lp/+) genes causes neural tube defects and raise the possibility that interaction between individual Vangl genes and other genetic loci and/or environmental factors may additionally contribute to the etiology of NTDs.

For this purpose, healthy right-handed subjects were asked to compare pairs of complex 2D geometrical tactile shapes presented in a sequential two-alternative forced-choice task. Shape encoding involved a large sensorimotor network including the primary (SI) and secondary (Sill somatosensory cortex, the anterior part of the intraparietal sulcus (IPA) and of the supramarginal gyrus (SMG), regions previously associated with somatosensory shape perception. Activations were also observed in posterior parietal regions (aSPL), motor and premotor regions (primary motor cortex (MI), ventral premotor cortex, dorsal premotor cortex, supplementary motor area), as well as prefrontal areas (aPFC, VLPFC), parietal-occipital cortex (POC) and cerebellum. We propose that this distributed network reflects construction and maintenance of sensorimotor traces of exploration hand movements during complex shape encoding, and subsequent transformation of these traces into a more abstract shape representation using kinesthetic imagery. Moreover, haptic shape encoding was found to activate the left lateral occipital complex (LOC), thus corroborating the implication of this extrastriate visual area in multisensory shape representation, besides its contribution to visual imagery. Furthermore, left hemisphere predominance was shown during encoding, whereas right hemisphere predominance was associated with the matching process. Activations of SI, MI, PMd and aSPL, which were predominant in the left hemisphere during the encoding, were shifted to the right hemisphere during the matching. In addition, new activations emerged (right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, bilateral inferior parietal lobe, right SII) suggesting their specific involvement during 2D geometrical shape matching.

It receives a substantial proportion of its afferents from cortical (e.g. lateral suprasylvian cortex) and subcortical (e.g. lateral posterior-pulvinar complex) areas known to participate in complex motion analysis. It has been established that a subset of AEV neurons can code the vericlical motion of a moving plaid pattern (pattern-motion selectivity). In our study, we have further investigated the possibility that AEV neurons may play a role in higher-order motion processing by studying their responses to complex stimuli which necessitate higher order spatial and temporal integration. Experiments were performed in anesthetized adult cats. Classical receptive fields were stimulated with (1) complex random-dot kinematograms (RDKs), where the individual elements of the pattern do not provide coherent motion cues; (2) optic flow fields which require global spatial integration. We report that a large proportion of AEV neurons were selective to the direction and speed of RDKs. Close to two-thirds of the cells were selective to the direction of optic flow fields with about equal proportions being selective to contraction and expansion. The complex RDK and optic flow responsive units could not be systematically characterized based on their responses to plaid patterns; they were either pattern- or com_ ponent-motion selective. These findings support the proposal that AEV is involved in higher-order motion processing. Our data suggest that the AEV may be more involved in the analysis of motion of visual patterns in relation to the animal's behavior rather than the analysis of the constituents of the patterns.

Here, we employed a novel combination of molecular strategies to find the responsible gene and show its effects in an animal model. Utilizing only three unrelated affected individuals and their relatives, we used homozygosity mapping with single-nucleotide polymorphism chips to localize AMRF. We then used microarray-expression analysis to prioritize candidates prior to sequencing. The disorder was mapped to 4q1-21, and microarray-expression analysis identified SCARB2/Limp2, which encodes a lysosomal-membrane protein, as the likely candidate. Mutations in SCARB2/Limp2 were found in all three families used for mapping and subsequently confirmed in two other unrelated AMRF families. The mutations were associated with lack of SCARB2 protein. Reanalysis of an existing Limp2 knockout mouse showed intracellular inclusions in cerebral and cerebellar cortex, and the kidneys showed subtle glomerular changes. This study highlights that recessive genes can be identified with a very small number of subjects. The ancestral lysosomal-membrane protein SCARB2/LIMP-2 is responsible for AMRF. The heterogeneous pathology in the kidney and brain suggests that SCARB2/Limp2 has pleiotropic effects that may be relevant to understanding the pathogenesis of other forms of glomerulosclerosis or collapse and myoclonic epilepsies.

We conducted genomewide linkage analysis for genes responsible for familial IGE in French-Canadian pedigrees. Twenty families segregating autosomal dominant epilepsy were collected. Four larger IGE families Sufficiently powerful for independent linkage analysis were genome-scanned and follow-up fine mapping was performed over regions with LOD scores >3.0. The genotyping of 16 smaller families was carried out at significantly linked loci for supportive linkage analysis and haplotype comparisons. one of the four families provided a significant linkage result at marker D10S1426 on chromosome 10 (two-point LOD score = 3.05, theta = 0, multipoint LOD score = 3.18). Fine mapping revealed a segregating haplotype and key recombination breakpoints, suggesting a candidate gene interval of 6.5 Mb. Multipoint linkage analyses using the additional 16 families yielded a maximum LOD score under heterogeneity of 4.23 (alpha = 0.34) at this locus. Evaluation of recombination breakpoints in these families narrowed the candidate region to 1.7 Mb. Sequencing of the two known genes in this region, NRP1 and PARD3, was negative for Mutation. Replication of linkage to this locus in other cohorts of IGE families is essential to characterize the underlying genetic mechanism for the disease. (C) 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Using continuous cinefluoroscopy, we conducted a prospective study comparing C-spine movement during intubation using direct laryngoscopy (DL) or GlideScope (R) videolayngoscopy (GVL), with uninterrupted manual in-line stabilization of the head by an assistant. METHODS: Twenty patients without C-spine pathology were studied. After induction of general anesthesia with neuromuscular blockade, both DL and GVL were performed on every patient in random order. Cinefluoroscopic images of C-spine movement during GVL and DL were acquired and divided into four stages: a baseline image before airway manipulation, glottic visualization, insertion of the endotracheal tube into the glottis, and tracheal intubation. Peak segmental motion from the occiput to C5 was measured offline for each patient and each stage, averages were calculated, and movements induced by each instrument were compared using a two-way ANOVA. Also studied were the proportion of patients with occiput-C1 rotation exceeding 10, 15, or 20 degrees, and the quality of glottic visualization. RESULTS: No significant difference was found between DL and GVL regarding average segmental spine movement at any level (P values between 0.22 and 0.70). During both techniques, motion was mainly an extension concentrated in the rostral C-spine and occurred predominantly during glottic visualization. The proportion of patients with occiput-Cl extension of more than 10, 15, or 20 degrees was not significantly different. Glottic visualization was significantly better with GVL compared with DL. CONCLUSION: During intubation under general anesthesia with neuromuscular blockade and manual in-line stabilization, the use of GVL produced better glottic visualization, but did not significantly decrease movement of the nonpathologic C-spine when compared with DL.

Pediatric patients with clinically isolated syndromes who had brain lesions had supratentorial lesion volumes similar to adult multiple sclerosis patients, but greater infratentorial lesion volumes (p < 0.009), particularly in the pons of male patients. The predilection for infratentorial lesions the pediatric patients with clinically isolated syndromes may reflect immunological differences or differences in myelin, possibly related to the caudorostral temporal gradient in myelin maturation.

The current status of traumatic Diaphragmatic injury: Lessons learned from 105 patients over 13 years	ANNALS OF THORACIC SURGERY			English	Article							THORACOABDOMINAL TRAUMA; PENETRATING INJURIES; BLUNT TRAUMA; RUPTURE; HERNIA	Background. Our understanding of traumatic diaphragmatic injury (TDI) is based primarily on outdated retrospective series. We sought to reexamine present day patterns of diagnosis, associated injuries, predictors of mortality, and long-term outcomes of this condition. Methods. A prospectively entered trauma database from the Montreal General Hospital was reviewed for patients admitted with a TDI from 1993 to 2006. Hospital charts were reviewed, and patient characteristics, mechanism of injury, associated injuries, operative management, and postoperative outcomes were recorded. Logistic regression was used to identify predictors for mortality. Results. Identified were 105 patients with TDI consisting of blunt in 37% and penetrating in 63%. Only 23% of TDI were diagnosed on initial chest roentgenogram. External wounds in penetrating TDI cases were found in the abdomen alone in 19%, in the chest alone in 46%, and in both in 35%, which was associated with intraabdominal organ injury in 83%, 55%, and 87%, respectively. Less than half of patients had a diaphragmatic hernia. Lung, chest wall, and thoracic organ injuries were more common in blunt trauma, but there was no significant difference between abdominal injuries in both mechanisms. Overall mortality from TDI was 18%, and there was no difference between blunt and penetrating injury. In blunt trauma, brain injury and an Injury Severity Score (ISS) exceeding 15 were independently associated with increased death. In penetrating trauma, only an ISS exceeding 15 predicted death. Conclusions. Traumatic diaphragmatic injury remains a challenge to diagnose and treat, primarily due to the presence of associated injuries. The high incidence of intraabdominal organ injury, irrespective of the site of penetrating wound, dictates a transabdominal approach for exploration and repair. Severity of associated injuries (ISS) predicts death.

A locus for primary lateral sclerosis on chromosome 4ptel-4p16.1	ARCHIVES OF NEUROLOGY			English	Article							HEREDITARY SPASTIC PARAPLEGIA	Background: Primary lateral sclerosis (PLS) is an adult-onset upper motor neuron disease resulting in spinal and bulbar spasticity. A family with 8 individuals diagnosed with PLS was previously reported. Objective: To identify a locus for a large family with PLS. Methods: A 550-marker whole-genome scan was performed on this family followed by fine mapping with sequence-tagged site markers to identify a candidate region. Results: A locus was identified for this family between the telomere of chromosome 4 and marker D4S2928 (4ptel-4p16.1). A maximum lod score of 3.01 was obtained for marker D4S2936. The region spans 23.17 cM (10.2 megabase pairs) and encompasses 130 genes. Conclusions: PLS1 does not map near any other identified loci for upper or lower motor neuron diseases and thus represents a novel locus for PLS.

To examine, in an inception cohort of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients, the association between neuropsychiatric (NP) events and anti-ribosomal P (anti-P), antiphospholipid (lupus anticoagulant [LAC], anticardiolipin), anti-beta 2-glycoprotein I, and anti-NR2 glutamate receptor antibodies. Methods. NP events were identified using the American College of Rheumatology case definitions and clustered into central/peripheral and diffuse/focal events. Attribution of NP events to SLE was determined using decision rules of differing stringency. Autoantibodies were measured without knowledge of NP events or their attribution. Results. Four hundred twelve patients were studied (87.4% female; mean +/- SD age 34.9 +/- 13.5 years, mean +/- SD disease duration 5.0 +/- 4.2 months). There were 214 NP events in 133 patients (32.3%). The proportion of NP events attributed to SLE varied from 15% to 36%. There was no association between autoantibodies and NP events overall. However, the frequency of anti-P antibodies in patients with central NP events attributed to SLE was 4 of 20 (20%), versus 3 of 107 (2.8%) in patients with other NP events and 24 of 279 (8.6%) in those with no NP events (P = 0.04). Among patients with diffuse NP events, 3 of 11 had anti-P antibodies (27%), compared with 4 of 111 patients with other NP events (3.6%) and 24 of 279 of those with no NP events (8.6%) (P 0.02). Specific clinical-serologic associations were found between anti-P and psychosis attributed to SLE (P = 0.02) and between LAC and cerebrovascular disease attributed to SLE (P = 0.038). There was no significant association between other autoantibodies and NP events. Conclusion. Clinically distinct NP events attributed to SLE and occurring around the time of diagnosis were found to be associated with anti-P antibodies and LAC. This Suggests that there are different autoimmune pathogenetic mechanisms, although low sensitivity limits the clinical application of testing for these antibodies.	[Hanly, J.

Patients with acute GIB, an unpredictable event, are most commonly evaluated and managed by non-gastroenterologists. Rapid and consistently reliable risk stratification of patients with acute GIB for urgent endoscopy may potentially improve outcomes amongst such patients by targeting scarce health-care resources to those who need it the most. Design and methods: Using ICD-9 codes for acute GIB, 189 patients with acute GIB and all. available data variables required to develop and test models were identified from a hospital medical records database. Data on 122 patients was utilized for development of the model and on 67 patients utilized to perform comparative analysis of the models. Clinical data such as presenting signs and symptoms, demographic data, presence of co-morbidities, laboratory data and corresponding endoscopic diagnosis and outcomes were collected. Clinical data and endoscopic diagnosis collected for each patient was utilized to retrospectively ascertain optimal management for each patient. Clinical presentations and corresponding treatment was utilized as training examples. Eight mathematical models including artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbor, linear discriminant analysis (LDA), shrunken centroid (SC), random forest (RF), logistic regression, and boosting were trained and tested. The performance of these models was compared using standard statistical analysis and ROC curves. Results: Overall the random forest model best predicted the source, need for resuscitation, and disposition with accuracies of approximately 80% or higher (accuracy for endoscopy was greater than 75%). The area under ROC curve for RF was greater than 0.85, indicating excellent performance by the random forest model Conclusion: While most mathematical models are effective as a decision support system for evaluation and management of patients with acute GIB, in our testing, the RF model consistently demonstrated the best performance. Amongst patients presenting with acute GIB, mathematical models may facilitate the identification of the source of GIB, need for intervention and allow optimization of care and healthcare resource allocation; these however require further validation.

Although perivascular dendritic cells found in inflammatory lesions are reported to polarize naive CD4(+) T lymphocytes into interleukin-17-secreting-cells, the origin of those antigen-presenting cells remains controversial. We demonstrate that a subset of CD14(+) monocytes migrate across the inflamed human bloodbrain barrier (BBB) and differentiate into CD83(+)CD209(+) dendritic cells under the influence of BBB-secreted transforming growth factor-beta and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. We also demonstrate that these dendritic cells secrete interleukin-12p70, transforming growth factor-beta and interleukin-6 and promote the proliferation and expansion of distinct populations of interferon-gamma-secreting Th1 and interleukin-17-secreting Th17 CD4(+) T lymphocytes. We further confirmed the abundance of such dendritic cells in situ, closely associated with microvascular BBB-endothelial cells within acute multiple sclerosis lesions, as well as a significant number of CD4(+) interleukin-17(+) T lymphocytes in the perivascular infiltrate. Our data support the notion that functional perivascular myeloid CNS dendritic cells arise as a consequence of migration of CD14(+) monocytes across the human BBB, through the concerted actions of BBB-secreted transforming growth factor-beta and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor.

In humans, music listening activates a wide-spread bilateral network of brain regions related to attention, semantic processing, memory, motor functions, and emotional processing. Music exposure also enhances emotional and cognitive functioning in healthy subjects and in various clinical patient groups. The potential role of music in neurological rehabilitation, however, has not been systematically investigated. This single-blind, randomized, and controlled trial was designed to determine whether everyday music listening can facilitate the recovery of cognitive functions and mood after stroke. In the acute recovery phase, 60 patients with a left or right hemisphere middle cerebral artery (MCA) stroke were randomly assigned to a music group, a language group, or a control group. During the following two months, the music and language groups listened daily to self-selected music or audio books, respectively, while the control group received no listening material. In addition, all patients received standard medical care and rehabilitation. All patients underwent an extensive neuropsychological assessment, which included a wide range of cognitive tests as well as mood and quality of life questionnaires, one week (baseline), 3 months, and 6 months after the stroke. Fifty-four patients completed the study. Results showed that recovery in the domains of verbal memory and focused attention improved significantly more in the music group than in the language and control groups. The music group also experienced less depressed and confused mood than the control group. These findings demonstrate for the first time that music listening during the early post-stroke stage can enhance cognitive recovery and prevent negative mood. The neural mechanisms potentially underlying these effects are discussed.

Two decades of cardiac transplantation at the Montreal Heart Institute	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF CARDIOLOGY			English	Article						congestive heart failure; follow-up study; surgery; survival; transplantation	FAILURE; SURVIVAL; CARVEDILOL; GENDER; TRIAL; AGE	BACKGROUND: The first heart transplantation in Canada was performed in 1968 at the Montreal Heart Institute (Montreal, Quebec). After nine patients transplanted in the precyclosporine era, the program was stopped. With the advent of cyclosporine, the program was reactivated in 1983. OBJECTIVE: To review the experience of the Montreal Heart Institute with heart transplantation between 1983 and 2005. METHODS: Three hundred patients underwent heart transplantation and were followed at the transplant clinic. Patients were divided into two groups: group 1 - first decade (1983 to 1993, n= 145) and group 2 - second decade (1994 to 2005, n= 155). RESULTS: There were 125 men (86%) and 20 women (14%) with a mean age of 45 10 years in group 1 compared with 118 men (76%) and 37 women (24%) with a mean age of 48 +/- 12 years in group 2 (P=0.03 and P=0.02, respectively). Indications for transplantation included congestive heart failure and/or ischemic heart disease in the majority of patients Of both groups, with 83% in group 1 and 73% in group 2, respectively. In group 1, 30 patients (21%) required preoperative pharmacological Support and 13 patients (9%) were on mechanical support compared with 16 (10%) and 34 (22%) patients in group 2 (P<0.01). The mean age of donors was 27 +/- 10 years and 34 +/- 13 years in groups I and 2, respectively (P<0.01). Major causes of mortality for donors included a motor vehicle accident in 65 cases (45%) and brain hemorrhage in 43 cases (30%) in group 1 compared with 34 cases (22%) and 68 cases (44%) in group 2 donors (P<0.01). The one-, five- and 10-year actuarial Survival rates were 86%, 77% and 71%, respectively, in group 1 compared with 84%, 80% and 68%, respectively, in group 2 (P=0.95). The one-, five- and 10-year freedom from rejection rates were 35%, 28% and 25%, respectively, in group 1 compared with 41%, 36% and 33%, respectively, in group 2 (P=0.13). The one-, five- and 10-year freedom from infection rates were 38%, 24% and 17%, respectively, in group 1 compared with 37%, 23% and 19%, respectively, in group 2 (P=0.72). The one- and five-year freedom from graft coronary artery disease rates were 93% and 67%, respectively, in group 1 compared with 88% and 81%, respectively, in group 2 (P<0.01). The one-, five- and 10-year cancer-free Survival rates were 98%, 91% and 73%, respectively, in group 1 compared with 98%, 90% and 77%, respectively, in group 2 (P=0.76). CONCLUSIONS: Patients who underwent heart transplantation in the second decade of the investigators' experience were older and in worse preoperative clinical condition; the donors were also older. However, Survival and event-free survival rates remained similar throughout both periods.

METHODS This descriptive study is based on data from the Cree Diabetes Information System, a unique diabetes management and surveillance system in the region that provides demographic and clinical data on physician-diagnosed cases of type 1 and 2 diabetes among the Cree of Eastern James Bay. RESULTS In July 2005, 1363 Cree were living with physician-diagnosed diabetes in Eeyou Istchee (17.3% crude prevalence age >= 20 years). The age-adjusted prevalence of diabetes among the Cree population (age >= 20 years) was 22.4%, 3.5 times higher than the Quebec age-adjusted diabetes prevalence of 6.4% (2003-2004). The crude prevalence of diabetes in Eeyou Istchee has increased by 330% in the past 16 years, from 5.2% of Cree adults (age >= 20 years) in 1989 to 17.3%. Those age <40 years account for 27.4% of all cases of diabetes in Eeyou Istchee, and 34.3% of Cree with diabetes have been diagnosed in the past 5 years. Target glycosylated hemoglobin levels (<= 7%) were achieved by 44.5% of patients; 42.9 and 51.3% achieved target low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (<= 2.50 mmol/L) and blood pressure (<= 130/80 mm Hg) levels, respectively. Nonetheless, 53.3% already have documented diabetic nephropathy, 12.5% have retinopathy, 9.5% have neuropathy and 12.6% have macrovascular disease. CONCLUSION The increasing numbers of young adults with newly diagnosed diabetes in the Cree region of Eeyou Istchee and the high rates of existing diabetic nephropathy are alarming health concerns from clinical and public health perspectives.

The objective of the present study was to evaluate the impact of past Ontario Neurotrauma Foundation (ONF) studentships and fellowships in terms of capacity building in the neurotrauma field in Ontario. Method: An online, cross sectional survey amongst past recipients of studentships and fellowships that terminated prior to July 2005. Explicit data were collected on various aspects of career development including current activity, awards and publications. Results: Thirty-six out of 42 (86%) eligible past trainees responded; 12 (33%) were Masters students, 12 (33%) were PhD students and 12 (33%) were Post-Doctoral students. A majority of the recipients (61%) are currently involved in neurotrauma-related activities (clinical, research and teaching) in more than 20% of their time, with no substantial differences between the degree groups. Half the recipients are currently involved in neurotrauma-related research in more than 20% of their time. The awardees published 1.5 peer-review manuscripts/person-year and received multiple awards. A high majority of our recipients (86%) feel that the ONF award had a substantial impact on their career. Conclusions: A high proportion of past award recipients remain involved in neurotrauma activities, especially in research. These results may lead to a cautious conclusion of the positive impact of the ONF studentships and fellowships on neurotrauma capacity building. These results should be considered in strategic planning of funding agencies similar to ONF.

However, there is no consensus as to which oxaliplatin/5-FU-containing regimen is superior in the first-line setting.This randomized, multicenter phase II trial was designed to evaluate and compare the efficacy of 4 different oxaliplatin/5-FU regimens. Patients and Methods: Patients with previously untreated metastatic CRC (mCRC; n = 129) were randomized to 1 of 4 treatment regimens: (1) continuous 5-FU infusion plus oxaliplatin (n = 23); (2) weekly 5-FU bolus with IV plus oxaliplatin (n = 40); (3) oxaliplatin with 2-day infusion 5-FU/LV (FOLFOX4, n = 4 1); and (4) chronomodulated 5-FU plus oxaliplatin (n = 25). Results: Overall response rates, after expert assessment, ranged from 24% to 34%, and median progression-free survival (PFS) ranged from 6 months to 8 months. Although no significant differences in efficacy were detected in pair-wise comparisons of the 4 different regimens, patients randomized to FOLFOX4 had the highest response rate and longest PFS.The FOLFOX4 regimen was also associated with the lowest incidence of severe (grade 3/4) toxicity, with the exception of cumulative peripheral neurotoxicity. Conclusion: This randomized phase II trial provides evidence that oxaliplatin/5-FU regimens are effective and well tolerated for first-line therapy of previously untreated mCRC.The FOLFOX regimens are now an established standard for CRC.

Within psychology and psychiatry, understanding of dissociative disorders has been hindered by polemical "either/or" arguments: either dissociative disorders are real, spontaneous alterations in brain states that reflect basic neurobiological phenomena, or they are imaginary, socially constructed role performances dictated by interpersonal expectations, power dynamics and cultural scripts. In this paper, we outline an approach to dissociative phenomena, including trance, possession and spiritual and healing practices, that integrates the neuropsychological notions of underlying mechanism with sociocultural processes of the narrative construction and social presentation of the self. This integrative model, grounded in a cultural neuroscience, can advance ethnographic studies of dissociation and inform clinical approaches to dissociation through careful consideration of the impact of social context.

Comorbidities and clinical determinants of outcome in children with spastic quadriplegic cerebral palsy	DEVELOPMENTAL MEDICINE AND CHILD NEUROLOGY			English	Article							GROSS MOTOR FUNCTION; FUNCTION CLASSIFICATION-SYSTEM; EPILEPSY; RELIABILITY; GROWTH	The objective of this study was to determine the major comorbidities in patients with spastic quadriplegic (SQ) cerebral palsy (CP) and their possible clinical associations. Medical records of patients with SQ CP from a pediatric neurology practice over a 14-year period were retrospectively and systematically reviewed. Variables examined included demographics, prenatal, perinatal, and postnatal risk factors. Comorbidities documented included those involving hearing, vision, feeding status, and epilepsy. Binomial logistic regression analyses were applied to identify clinical associations of the comorbidities. Ninety-two children were included in this study of whom 39 were born preterm. Mean age of presentation was 2 months (SD 3.5) and males comprised 60% of the group. A total of 57% had a Gross Motor Function Classification Score (GMFCS) of Level IV or V. The four documented comorbidities occurred at a high frequency: 66 out of 83 children (80%) had a visual impairment with 13 (21%) having a substantial impairment; 37 out of 86 children (40%) had a hearing deficit; 43 out of 92 children (47%) had epilepsy; and 29 (33%) required assisted feeding. A GMFCS Level of IV or V and documented microcephaly was associated with the need for assisted feeding (odds ratio [OR] 8.1; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.1-29.8, p=0.002 and OR 4.9, 95% CI 1.7-14.8, p=0.004 respectively). Epilepsy was associated with the occurrence of neonatal encephalopathy (OR 2.3, 95% CI 1.0-55; p=0.05), microcephaly (OR 4.9, 95% CI 1.6-14.8; p=0.004), periventricular leukomalacia (OR 7.4, 95% CI 1.6-35.0; p=0.012), and perinatal asphyxia (OR 3.6, 95% CI 1.5-8.9; p=0.005). There is a high frequency of comorbidity in the setting of SQ CP which can impact on quality of life and burdens of care. Few clinical associations of this burden appear, thus necessitating systematic programmatic follow-up of these children to facilitate early identification and intervention.

Prevention of paclitaxel-evoked painful peripheral neuropathy by acetyl-L-carnitine: Effects on axonal mitochondria, sensory nerve fiber terminal arbors, and cutaneous Langerhans cells	EXPERIMENTAL NEUROLOGY			English	Article						allodynia; chemotherapy; hyperalgesia; Langerhans cell; neuroprotection; neurotoxicity	CHOLINE-ACETYLTRANSFERASE ACTIVITY; ANTIRETROVIRAL TOXIC NEUROPATHY; PERMEABILITY TRANSITION PORE; DIABETIC-NEUROPATHY; INDUCED NEUROTOXICITY; LEVOCARNITINE ACETYL; OXIDATIVE STRESS; SUPPORTING CELLS; NEURONAL RESCUE; PROTECTIVE ROLE	Prophylactic treatment with acetyl-L-carnitine (ALCAR) prevents the neuropathic pain syndrome that is evoked by the chemotherapeutic agent, paclitaxel. The paclitaxel-evoked pain syndrome is associated with degeneration of the intraepidermal terminal arbors of primary afferent neurons, with the activation of cutaneous Langerhans cells, and with an increased incidence of swollen and vacuolated axonal mitochondria in A-fibers and C-fibers. Previous work suggests that ALCAR is neuroprotective in other nerve injury models and that it improves mitochondrial dysfunction. Thus, we examined whether the prophylactic efficacy of ALCAR was associated with the prevention of intraepidermal terminal arbor degeneration, the inhibition of Langerhans cell activation, or the inhibition of swelling and vacuolation of axonal mitochondria. In animals with a confirmed ALCAR effect, we found no evidence of a neuroprotective effect on the paclitaxel-evoked degeneration of sensory terminal arbors or an inhibition of the paclitaxel-evoked activation of Langerhans cells. However, ALCAR treatment completely prevented the paclitaxel-evoked increase in the incidence of swollen and vacuolated C-fiber mitochondria, while having no effect on the paclitaxel-evoked changes in A-fiber mitochondria. Our results suggest that the efficacy of prophylactic ALCAR treatment against the paclitaxel-evoked pain may be related to a protective effect on C-fiber mitochondria. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

We have recently described that trans-arachidonic acids (TAA) are major products of NO2-mediated isomerization of arachidonic acid in cell membranes and that nitrative stress increases TAA levels leading to neural microvascular degeneration. In the present study, we explored whether TAA exert acute effects on neuromicrovascular tone and investigated potential mechanisms thereof. TAA induced an endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation of rat brain pial microvasculature. This vasorelaxation was independent of nitric oxide, prostanoids, lipoxygenase products, and CYP450 metabolite trans-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids. However, inhibition of heme oxygenase (using zinc protoporphyrin IX) and of dependent soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC; using ODQ) significantly diminished (by similar to 70%) the TAA-induced vasorelaxation. Consistent with these findings, TAA stimulated heme oxygenase (HO)-2-dependent bilirubin (using siRNA HO-2) and cGMP formation, and the HO product carbon monoxide (using CO-releasing CORM-2) reproduced the sGC-dependent cGMP formation and vasorelaxation. Further exploration revealed that TAA-induced vasorelaxation and bilirubin formation (HO activation) were nearly abrogated by large-conductance calcium-dependent potassium channels (BKCa) (using TEA and iberiotoxin). Opening of BKCa with the selective activator NS1619 induced a concentration-dependent vasorelaxation, which was inhibited by HO and sGC inhibitors. Coimmunoprecipitation suggested a molecular complex interaction between BKCa and HO-2 (but not HO-1). Collectively, these findings identify new properties of TAA, specifically cerebral vasorelaxation through interactive activation of BKCa with HO-2 and, in turn, sGC. Our findings provide new insights into the characterization of nitrative stress-derived TAA products, by showing they can act as acute mediators of nitrative stress on neurovascular tone.

The acute inflammatory response is thought to contribute largely to this secondary damage. We show here that 15deoxy-Delta-(12,14)-prostaglandin J(2) (15d-PGJ(2)), a metabolite of prostaglandin D-2 (PGD(2)) that has anti-inflammatory actions, given daily for the first 2 weeks after spinal cord contusion injury in mice, results in significant improvement of sensory and locomotor function. 15d-PGJ(2)-treated mice also show diminished signs of microglia/macrophage activation, increased neuronal survival, greater serotonergic innervation, and reduced demyelination in the injured spinal cord. These changes are accompanied by a reduction in chemokine and pro-inflammatory cytokine expression. Our results also indicate that 15d-PGJ2 is likely to reduce inflammation in the injured spinal cord by attenuating multiple signaling pathways: reducing activation of NF-kappa B; enhancing expression of suppressor of cytokine signaling1 and reducing the activation of Janus activated Kinase 2.

GRF features are first extracted from the force vector variations as a function of time and then classified by the nearest neighbor rule. We investigated two different features: the coefficients of a polynomial expansion and the coefficients of a wavelet decomposition. We also analyzed the impact of each GRIT component (vertical, anteroposterior, and medial lateral) on classification. The best discrimination rate (91 %) was achieved with the wavelet decomposition using the anteroposterior and the medial lateral components. These results demonstrate the validity of the representation and the classifier for automatic classification of AS and OA knee gait patterns. They also highlight the relevance of the anteroposterior and medial lateral force components in gait pattern classification.

Design: Retrospective, observational, case-control study. Setting: Neurosciences Critical Care Unit of a university hospital. Patients: Forty-one patients with moderate or severe TBI who underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) during the acute phase (less than seven days) of TBI. MRI scans of 43 normal healthy volunteers were used as controls. Interventions: None. Measurements and main results: Patient demographics, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) score, Injury Severity Score (ISS), post-resuscitation Glasgow Coma Score (GCS), Glasgow Outcome Score (GOS), mean intracranial pressure (ICP), mean cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), computed tomography (CT) data, pituitary gland volumes and structural lesions in the pituitary on MRI scans. The pituitary glands were significantly enlarged in the TBI group (the median and interquartile range were as follows: cases 672mm(3) (range 601-783mm3) and controls 552mm(3) (range 445-620mm(3)); p value<0.0001). APACHE II, GCS, GOS and ICP were not significantly correlated with the pituitary volume. Twelve of the 41 cases (30%) demonstrated focal changes in the pituitary gland (haemorrhage/haemorrhagic infarction (n=5), swollen gland with bulging superior margin (n=5), heterogeneous signal intensities in the anterior lobe (n=2) and partial transection of the infundibular stalk (n=1). Conclusions: Acute TBI is associated with pituitary gland enlargement with specific lesions, which are seen in approximately 30% of patients. MRI of the pituitary may provide useful information about the mechanisms involved in post-traumatic hypopituitarism.

According to previous in vitro studies, BTG2 overexpression leads to delayed cell cycling. We investigated BTG2 expression during mouse ontogeny and its immune and circadian functions in this study. In situ hybridization showed that BTG2 was expressed at high levels in the central nervous system, liver, stomach, thymus, spleen, skin, adrenal gland, pituitary gland and salivary glands during embryonic days (E10-E17), postnatal days (P1 and P10) and adult stages. Expression was observed in organs and tissues from adult mice with and without a robust proliferation program. Thus, the gene might have important functions that are both related and unrelated to proliferation. BTG2 expression was induced after in vitro T-cell receptor stimulation in T cells using anti-CD3 antibodies. However, transgenic (Tg) mice with actin promoter-driven expression of BTG2 showed normal in vitro and in vivo T-cell responses, such as thymus development, T-cell activation marker expression, T-cell proliferation and migration, as well as in vivo delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions. Although BTG2 was expressed in the suprachiasmatic nucleus and pineal gland in the brain, BTG2 Tg mice had no abnormal circadian behavior. Our data on BTG2 expression during ontogeny provide useful clues for the further investigation of BTG2 function. Additional studies are warranted to examine its role in immune and other systems.

J	Campbell-Yeo, M; Latimer, M; Johnston, C				Campbell-Yeo, Marsha; Latimer, Margot; Johnston, Celeste			The empathetic response in nurses who treat pain: concept analysis	JOURNAL OF ADVANCED NURSING			English	Article						concept analysis; empathy; healthcare professionals; nursing; pain; Rodgers	NURSING KNOWLEDGE; NEURAL MECHANISMS; OTHERS PAIN; MODULATION; ATTENTION; HUMANS; CORTEX; IMPACT; AREAS	Aim. This paper is a report of a concept analysis of empathy. Background. It is widely accepted that an empathetic response is necessary for nurses to deliver adequate pain relief and therapeutic care. Previous work suggests that empathy is a learned behaviour, and thus can be blocked if necessary to diminish personal distress. Methods. A computerized search of the CINAHL, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and Web of Science databases from 1980 to 2007 was conducted, using the keywords pain and empathy, both alone and in combination. Similar concepts such as sympathy, caring and compathy were included if the database distinguished between these concepts. Twenty-five relevant articles were reviewed and Rodgers evolutionary concept analysis process was used to clarify the concept. Findings. The recent observation that a mirror-like neural response occurs in the brain of a person witnessing another in pain provides compelling evidence that empathetic arousal may occur independent of the previously described attributes of prior experience or learned cognitive appraisal. Conclusion. While the empathetic response of care providers plays a central role in the recognition and treatment of pain, nurses are taught that regulation of this response is important to protect themselves against the traumatic effects of seeing patients in pain. However, there is emerging evidence that some elements of empathetic arousal are autonomic and therefore unable to be fully controlled; this may have important implications for nurses' vulnerability.

The diagnostic technique is either computed tomography cisternography or MR cisternography. For evaluating the safety of diagnostic modalities and efficacy of treatment especially in terms of surgery, animal studies demonstrating traumatic cerebrospinal fistula model are indispensable not only for neurosurgeons but also for neuroradiologists. The authors in this paper describe a traumatic cerebrospinal fistula in an animal model using rabbits. The cerebrospinal fluid leakage was demonstrated successfully in all eight rabbits and was verified by computed tomography cisternography. The results led us to conclude that rabbit model of traumatic cerebrospinal fluid fistula is safe and has low mortality and morbidity rates. Further studies including larger number of animals should be considered in order to verify safety more accurately.

The combination of subdural hematoma, retinal hemorrhage, brain swelling, and diffuse axonal injury is highly typical of this syndrome and faced with these autopsy findings, induced traumatic lesions are strongly considered. However, it is known that motor-vehicle accidents and falls from great height can also produce this pattern of injury. Nevertheless, stories of arms fall, couch fall, or bumped head while the baby is being carried are generally considered incompatible with SBS. We here report a case of a 2-year-old boy presenting with all the classic autopsy findings of SBS from a playground rocking toy shaken by an older child.

In this study, we use an objective measure of facial expression to compare affect in CdLS with that seen in Cri du Chat syndrome (CDC) and a group of individuals with a mixed aetiology of intellectual disabilities (ID). Method Observations of three groups Of 14 children with CdLS, CDC and mixed aetiology of ID were undertaken when a one-to-one interaction was ongoing. Results There was no significant difference between the groups in the duration of positive, negative or flat affect. However, the CdLS group displayed a significantly lower ratio of positive to negative affect than children in the other groups. Discussion This difference partially confirms anecdotal observations and could be due to the expression of pain caused by health problems associated with CdLS or neurological expression of the CdLS gene in facial muscles related to expression of positive affect. However, further research is needed to directly test these possible associations.

Features were first extracted from the GRF vectors to be used for classification. We investigated a two-level hierarchical classification and analysis method using the nearest neighbor rule. At the first level, the GRF data were classified into two classes: AS and OA. At the second level, the GRF data of OA patients were classified according to the pathology severity. The OA patients were grouped into two OA severity categories according to the Kellgren and Lawrence (KL) scale: KL 1 and KL 2 for one category, and KL 3 and KL 4 for the other. Experiments were conducted using data of 42 cases, 16 AS and 26 pathological. The method discriminated between AS and OA subjects with an accuracy of 38 of 42 cases, and assessed the severity correctly with an accuracy of 20 of 26 cases. These results demonstrated the validity of both, the feature and the classifier, for automatic classification of AS and knee OA gait patterns and for analysis of OA severity.

In this study, seizure activity associated with the four-vessel occlusion model of cerebral ischemia was monitored using chronically implanted electrodes in the CA1/subicular region, the perirhinal cortex, and the prefrontal cortex of the rat. Background EEG amplitude was reduced in all recording sites during occlusion, but spiking and bursting activity was also observed. Seizure activity occurred in most animals during the first several hours of reperfusion, but was not observed on subsequent days. Epileptiform spikes and bursts were often synchronous between two or three recording sites, and spikes in the CA1 region also often occurred just prior to spikes in other sites. These results demonstrate that the four-vessel occlusion model can lead to patterns of seizure activity in the hippocampus, prefrontal and perirhinal cortices.	[Caruana, D. A.; Nesbitt, C.; Mumby, D.

Widespread immunoreactivity for neuronal nuclei in cultured human and rodent astrocytes	JOURNAL OF NEUROCHEMISTRY			English	Article						astrocyte; glial fibrillary acidic protein; neuronal nucleus; neuron; postnatal day 10 rat; specificity	RADIAL GLIA; NEUN; CELLS; DIFFERENTIATION; ANTIGEN; PROTEIN; MARKER	The monoclonal antibody (mAb) neuronal nuclei (NeuN) labels the nuclei of mature neurons in vivo in vertebrates. NeuN has also been used to define post-mitotic neurons or differentiating neuronal precursors in vitro. In this study, we demonstrate that the NeuN mAb labels the nuclei of astrocytes cultured from fetal and adult human, newborn rat, and embryonic mouse brain tissue. A non-neuronal fibroblast cell line (3T3) also displayed NeuN immunoreactivity. We confirmed that NeuN labels neurons but not astrocytes in sections of P10 rat brain. Western blot analysis of NeuN immunoreactive species revealed a distribution of bands in nucleus-enriched fractions derived from the different cell lines that was similar, but not identical to adult rat brain homogenates. We then examined the hypothesis that the glial fibrillary acidic protein/NeuN-double positive population of cells might correspond to neuronal precursors. Although the NeuN-positive astrocytes were proliferating, no evidence of neurogenesis was detected. Furthermore, expression of additional neuronal precursor markers was not detected. Our results indicate that primary astrocytes derived from mouse, rat, and human brain express NeuN. Our findings are consistent with NeuN being a selective marker of neurons in vivo, but indicate that studies utilizing NeuN-immunoreactivity as a definitive marker of post-mitotic neurons in vitro should be interpreted with caution.

We determined the ability of humans to estimate the tangential speed of surfaces moved under the stationary fingertip and the extent to which the physical characteristics of the surfaces modify speed perception. Scanning speed ranged from 33 to 110 mm/s (duration of motion constant). Subjects could scale tactile scanning speed, but surface structure was essential because the subjects were poor at scaling the speed of a moving smooth surface. For textured surfaces, subjective magnitude estimates increased linearly across the range of speeds tested. The spatial characteristics of the surfaces influenced speed perception, with the roughest surface (8 mm spatial period, SP) being perceived as moving 15% slower than the smoother, textured surfaces (2-3 mm SP). Neither dot disposition (periodic, non periodic) nor dot density contributed to the results, suggesting that the critical factor was dot spacing in the direction of the scan. A single monotonic relation between subjective speed and temporal frequency (speed/SP) was obtained when the ratings were normalized for SP. This provides clear predictions for identifying those cortical neurons that play a critical role in tactile motion perception and the underlying neuronal code. Finally, the results were consistent with observations in the visual system (decreased subjective speed with a decrease in spatial frequency, 1/SP), suggesting that stimulus motion is processed similarly in both sensory systems.

Both IBS and FAP are associated with rectal hypersensitivity. We hypothesized that in children with IBS and FAP, the rectal sensory threshold for pain (RSTP) is associated with symptom severity. Paitents and Methods: A total of 47 patients (34 girls; median age, 14.2 years) with IBS (n = 29) and FAP (n = 18), according to the Rome 11 criteria, underwent a rectal barostat examination to determine their RSTR Gastrointestinal symptom severity was assessed by validated questionnaires. During the rectal barostat exam, symptoms were documented using a visual analog scale and by measuring the area coloured on a human body diagram corresponding to painful sensations. Results: The median RSTP was 16 mmHg and was similar in IBS and FAP patients. Eighty-three percent of the patients had rectal hypersensitivity (RSTP <= 30.8 mmHg, the 5th percentile of control children studied in our laboratory). Fifty-one percent and 36%, respectively, reported missing school and social activities at least once per week. Increased frequency of pain, missed days of school, missed social activities, and pain during the barostat examination were not associated with lower RSTP values in either the whole group or in the subset of children with rectal hypersensitivity. Conclusions: Rectal hypersensitivity is not proportional to the severity of symptoms in children with IBS and FAP, indicating that symptom severity is influenced by other factors in addition to visceral hypersensitivity.

We demonstrate here the transcytosis ability of aprotinin and peptides derived from Kunitz domains using an in vitro model of the BBB and in situ brain perfusion. Aprotinin transcytosis across bovine brain capillary endothelial cell (BBCEC) monolayers is at least 10-fold greater than that of holo-transferrin. Sucrose permeability was unaffected by high concentrations of aprotinin, indicating that transcytosis of aprotinin was unrelated to changes in the BBCEC monolayer integrity. Alignment of the amino acid sequence of aprotinin with the Kunitz domains of human proteins allowed the identification and design of a family of peptides, named Angiopeps. These peptides, and in particular Angiopep-2, exhibit higher transcytosis capacity and parenchyma accumulation than aprotinin. Overall, these results suggest that these Kunitz-derived peptides could be advantageously used as a new brain delivery system for pharmacological agents that do not readily enter the brain.

However, it is less clear how the descending cortical signal interacts with the interneuronal networks in the spinal cord to ensure that precise changes in limb trajectory are appropriately incorporated into the base locomotor rhythm. Here we suggest that subpopulations of motor cortical neurones, active sequentially during the step cycle, may regulate the activity of small groups of synergistic muscles, likewise active sequentially throughout the step cycle. These synergies, identified by a novel associative cluster analysis, are defined by periods of muscle activity that are coextensive with respect to the onset and offset of the EMG activity. Moreover, the synergies are sparse and are frequently composed of muscles acting around more than one joint. During gait modifications, we suggest that subpopulations of motor cortical neurones may modify the magnitude and phase of the EMG activity of all muscles contained within a given synergy.

Accumulating evidence suggests that the polyamine system also plays a role in the etiology and pathology of mental disorders. Alterations in the expression and activity of polyamine metabolic enzymes, as well as changes in the levels of the individual polyamines, have been observed in multiple conditions, including schizophrenia, mood disorders, anxiety and suicidal behaviour. Additionally, these components have been found to be altered by various psychiatric treatments. Further, the polyamines and their precursors have demonstrated both antidepressant and anxiolytic effects. Overall, findings to date suggest that the polyamine pathway represents an important frontier for the development of neuropharmacological treatments.

The Self-Evaluation Questionnaire (QAM) assessed memory complaints relative to 10 domains of concrete activities of daily life in 68 persons with MCI. 26 persons with Alzheimer's disease (AD). and 8 1 healthy older adults. In addition, a neuropsychological battery was administered to assess whether subjective complaints were linked to actual cognitive performance. The findings indicate that individuals with MCI report more memory complaints than controls for a range of specific materials/circumstances. MCI and AD individuals did not differ in their level of memory complaints. Correlational analyses indicated that a higher level of memory complaints relative to conversations and to movies and books were associated with a higher level of objective cognitive deficits in persons with MCI but not in AD. furthermore, complaints increased in parallel with global cognitive deficits in MCI. These results suggest that persons with MCI report more memory complaints than healthy older controls. but only in specific domains and Circumstances. and that anosognosia is more characteristic of the demented than of the MCI phase of Alzheimer's disease.

We tested younger and older adults, and we separated older adults into groups with high and low working memory (WM); that is, we separated them into old-high-WM and old-low-WM groups. On average, all participants responded more slowly in mixed-task than in single-task blocks (i.e., reaction time or RT mixing cost). Younger adults and old-high-WM participants had equivalent RT mixing costs and showed larger posterior negative slow-wave activity when preparing for mixed trials than for single-task trials, suggesting that mixed-task trials required trial-to-trial preparation. Old-high-WM participants also showed frontally distributed activity on mixed-task trials, suggesting their use of executive control to offset age-related differences in mixed-task preparation. In contrast, old-low-WM participants had large RT mixing costs and large posterior event-related brain potential negativities during single-task trials, suggesting that they prepare during single- and mixed-task blocks. High WM, therefore, may help older adults offset the age-related difficulties often observed when they are task switching.

Glucose loading precipitates focal lactic acidosis in the vulnerable medial thalamus of thiamine-deficient rats	METABOLIC BRAIN DISEASE			English	Article						thiamine deficiency; lactate; glucose loading; cerebral acidosis; Wernicke's Encephalopathy	WERNICKE-KORSAKOFF-SYNDROME; 2 EXPERIMENTAL-MODELS; DEPENDENT ENZYMES; OXYGEN RADICALS; BRAIN PH; ENCEPHALOPATHY; DAMAGE; DEHYDROGENASE; PYRITHIAMINE; METABOLISM	Glucose loading in thiamine-deficient patients is known to precipitate Wernicke's Encephalopathy; however, the mechanisms responsible have not been fully elucidated. Lactate accumulation occurs in brains of thiamine-deficient rats. In order to determine whether glucose loading in thiamine-deficient rats causes selective lactic acidosis in vulnerable brain structures, cerebral pH was measured autoradiographically using 14-labeled 5,5-dimethyloxazolidine-2, 4-dione ([C-14]DMO) in the medial thalamus, a vulnerable brain region, versus cerebral cortex, a brain region that is spared in thiamine deficiency. Following administration of a glucose load, regional lactate levels and de novo lactate synthesis measured by H-1-C-13-NMR spectroscopy, increased significantly to 21.86 +/- 3.04 mu mol/g (wet weight) in the medial thalamus (p < 0.001) and pH in this brain region was decreased significantly from 7.08 +/- 0.04 to 6.87 +/- 0.05 (p < 0.001). No such changes were observed in cerebral cortex following a glucose load. These results demonstrate that the increased production and accumulation of brain lactate result in acidosis following glucose loading in thiamine deficiency. Alterations of brain pH could contribute to the pathogenesis of thalamic neuronal damage and consequent cerebral dysfunction in Wernicke's Encephalopathy.

Reduced plasma dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate levels are significantly correlated with fatigue severity in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis	NEUROCHEMISTRY INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						primary biliary cirrhosis; fatigue; neuroactive steroids; DHEAS	CHRONIC HEPATITIS-C; DOUBLE-BLIND; LIVER-DISEASE; SEX-HORMONES; POSTMENOPAUSAL WOMEN; NEUROACTIVE STEROIDS; IMPACT SCALE; RAT MODEL; NEUROSTEROIDS; RECEPTOR	Fatigue is a common debilitating complication of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), the pathophysiologic mechanism of which is poorly understood. Recently, the neuroactive steroid dehydroepinadrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) was reported to be implicated in Chronic Fatigue Syndrome in the absence of liver disease. The present study was undertaken to analyse fatigue scores and their relationship with disease severity and circulating levels of DHEAS as well as its precursors DHEA and pregnenolone in PBC patients with (n = 15) or without fatigue (n = 10) compared to control subjects (n = 11). Fatigue was assessed using the fatigue impact scale (FIS) including cognitive, physical and psychosocial subclasses. Steroids were measured by radioimmunoassay or gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Plasma concentrations of DHEAS were significantly reduced in PBC patients with fatigue as compared to controls, while those of its precursors DHEA and pregnenolone remained within the control range. Plasma levels of DHEAS in PBC patients were significantly correlated with fatigue severity as reflected by total FIS scores including total (rp = -0.42; p = 0.018), as well as the cognitive (rp = -0.37; p = 0.03), physical (rp = -0.48; p = 0.006) and psychosocial (rp = -0.35; p = 0.04) subclasses of fatigue scores. No correlation of fatigue scores was observed with indices of liver function. These findings suggest that reduced levels of the neurosteroid DHEAS may contribute to fatigue in patients with PBC; substitutive therapy using DHEAS or its precursor DHEA could be beneficial in the management of fatigue in patients with low levels of DHEAS.

In acute liver failure, astrocytes undergo swelling which results in increased intracranial pressure and may lead to brain herniation and death. In chronic liver failure, Alzheimer-type II astrocytosis is the characteristic neuropathologic finding. Patients with liver failure manifest severe alterations of their quality of life including sleep disorders as well as memory, learning, and locomotor abnormalities. Neurosteroids (NS) are synthesized in the brain mainly by astrocytes independent of peripheral steroidal sources (adrenals and gonads) and are suggested to play a role in the pathogenesis of HE. NS bind and modulate different types of neural receptors; effects on the gamma amino butyric acid (GABA)-A receptor complex are the most extensively studied. For example, the NS tetrahydroprogesterone (allopregnanolone), and tetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone (THDOC) are potent positive allosteric modulators of the GABA-A receptor. As a consequence of modulation of these receptors, NS stimulate inhibitory neurotransmission in the CNS, and neuroinhibitory changes including "increased GABA-ergic tone" have been suggested as pathophysiological mechanisms in HE. Moreover, some NS bind to intracellular receptors through which they also regulate gene expression, and there is substantial evidence confirming that expression of genes coding for key astrocytic and neuronal proteins are altered in HE. This review summarizes findings consistent with the involvement of NS in human and experimental HE. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Indeed, the rapid increase of serotonin (5-HT) caused by SSRIs, stimulates the 5-HT1A autoreceptors, which exert a negative feedback on the 5-HT neurotransmission. Only when autoreceptors are desensitized, can SSRIs exert their therapeutic activity. The 5-HT1A receptor antagonist pindolol has been used to accelerate the clinical effects of antidepressant by preventing the negative feedback. Using the alpha-[C-11]methyl-L-tryptophan/positron emission tomography (PET), the goal of the present double-blind, randomized study was to compare the changes in alpha-[C-11]methyl-L-tryptophan trapping, an index of serotonin synthesis, in patients suffering from unipolar depression treated with the SSRI citalopram (20 mg/day) plus placebo versus patients treated with citalopram plus pindol (7.5 mg/day). PET and Hamilton depression rating scale (HDRS-17) were performed at baseline, and after 10 and 24 days of antidepressant treatment. Results show that the combination citalopram plus pindol, compared to citalopram alone shows a more rapid and greater increase of an index of 5-HT synthesis in prefrontal cortex (BA 9). This research is the first human PET study demonstrating that, after 24 days, the combination SSRIs plus pindolol produces a greater increase of the metabolism of serotonin in the prefrontal cortex, an area associated to depressive symptoms.

On the basis of regional homogeneity (ReHo), a mapping of brain function at resting state, PCA-based Fisher discriminative analysis (PC-FDA) was trained to build a linear classifier. Permutation test was then conducted to identify the brain areas with the most significant contribution to the final discrimination. Experimental results showed a correct classification rate of 85% using a leave-one-out cross-validation. Moreover, some highly discriminative brain regions, like the prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex, well confirmed the previous findings on ADHD. Interestingly, some important but less reported regions such as the thalamus were also identified. We conclude that the classifier, using resting-state brain function as classification feature, has potential ability to improve current diagnosis and treatment evaluation of ADHD.

Injection of modified adenovirus 5 (AdV5) and adeno-associated virus 2 (AAV2) vectors containing myophosphorylase expression cassettes, into semitendinosus muscle of sheep with McArdle's disease, produced expression of functional myophosphorylase and some re-expression of the non-muscle glycogen phosphorylase isoforms (both liver and brain) in regenerating fibres. Expression of both non-muscle isoforms was also seen after control injections of AdV5LacZ vectors. There was up to an order of magnitude greater expression of phosphorylase after myophosphorylase vector injection than after LacZ controls (62% of sections with over 1000 positive muscle fibres, versus 7%). The results presented here suggest that the use of viral vector-mediated phosphorylase gene transfer may be applicable to the treatment of McArdle's disease and that sustained re-expression of the brain and liver isoforms should also be investigated as a possible treatment.

Unfortunately, research on pain and emotion expression has been conducted largely in parallel with few bridges allowing for direct comparison of the expressive displays and their impact on observers. Moreover, although facial expressions are highly dynamic, previous research has relied mainly on static photographs. Here we directly compare the recognition and discrimination of dynamic facial expressions of pain and basic emotions by naive observers. One-second film clips were recorded in eight actors displaying neutral facial expressions and expressions of pain and the basic emotions of anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness and surprise. Results based on the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) confirmed the distinct (and prototypical) configuration of pain and basic emotion expressions reported in previous studies. Volunteers' evaluations of those dynamic expressions on intensity, arousal and valence demonstrate the high sensitivity and specificity of the observers' judgement. Additional rating data further suggest that, for comparable expression intensity, pain is perceived as more arousing and more unpleasant. This study strongly supports the claim that the facial expression of pain is distinct from the expression of basic emotions. This set of dynamic facial expressions provides unique material to explore the psychological and neurobiological processes underlying the perception of pain expression, its impact on the observer, and its role in the regulation of social behaviour.

A phase II trial of rebeccamycin analogue (NSC #655649) in children with solid tumors: A children's oncology group study	PEDIATRIC BLOOD & CANCER			English	Article						pediatric solid tumors; rebeccamycin analogue; phase II	TOPOISOMERASE-I; ANTIMICROBIAL PROPERTIES; NSC-655649; ANTITUMOR; CANCER; DERIVATIVES; INHIBITION; DNA	Background. Rebeccamycin Analogue (NSC #655649), a chemically synthesized glycosyl-dichloro-indolocarbazole derivative of rebeccamycin with topoisomerase inhibiting activity, has in vitro activity against pediatric tumor cell lines and tumor specimens including rhabdomyosarcoma, neuroblastoma, Ewing's sarcoma and medulloblastoma. Procedure. The primary objective of this trial was to determine the response rate to Rebeccamycin analogue NSC #655649 in children with refractory solid and CNS tumors. Secondary objectives included further evaluation of the toxicity and pharmacokinetic profile of Rebeccamycin analogue in children c with relapsed and refractory cancer. A two-stage design was used for this Phase II trial. Rebeccamycin analogue, 650 mg/m(2), was administered every 21 days, and Could be escalated to 780 mg/m(2) in subsequent cycles to achieve a maximum plasma drug concentration >5 mu g/ml. Results. From July 2000 to October 2004, 72 male and 61 female eligible patients were enrolled. Of 126 evaluable patients for response, only 4 patients had an objective response: 3 patients with rhabdomyosarcoma (1 CR and 2 PR) and 1 patient with neuroblastoma (1 PR). Grade 3 or 4 myelosuppression occurred in 81% (215/265) of patient Courses and hepatotoxicity in 14% (37/265) of patient courses. Transient pancreatitis and/or elevation of amylase and lipase occurred in 6 patients. Conclusions. The 15% response rate to Rebeccamycin analogue observed in patients with rhabdomyosarcoma, while of interest, is associated with significant myelosuppression. With a global response rate of 3% observed in children with relapsed CNS and non-CNS solid tumors, further development of Rebeccamycin analogue in pediatric solid tumors is not recommended.

Quantitative trait locus and computational mapping identifies Kcnj9 (GIRK3) as a candidate gene affecting analgesia from multiple drug classes	PHARMACOGENETICS AND GENOMICS			English	Article						antinociception; cannabinoid; clonidine; GIRK; morphine; quantitative trait locus mapping	POTASSIUM CHANNEL SUBUNIT; MORPHINE ANALGESIA; K+ CHANNELS; MICE; PAIN; ANTINOCICEPTION; HERITABILITY; NOCICEPTION; EXPRESSION; COMPLEX	Aims Interindividual differences in analgesic drug response complicate the clinical management of pain We aimed to identify genetic factors responsible for variable sensitivity to analgesic drugs of disparate neurochemical classes. Methods and results Quantitative trait locus mapping in 872 (C57BL/6 x 129P3)F-2 mice was used to identify genetic factors contributing to variability in the analgesic effect of opioid (morphine), alpha(2)-adrenergic (clonidine), and cannabinoid (WIN55,212-2)drugs against thermal nociception. A region on distal chromosome 1 showing significant linkage to analgesia from all three drugs was identified. Computational (in silico) genetic analysis of analgesic responses measured in a panel of inbred strains identified a haplotype block within this region containing the Kcnj9 and Kcnj10 genes, encoding the Kir3.3 (GIRK3) and Kir4.1 inwardly rectifying potassium channel subunits. The genes are differentially expressed in the midbrain periaqueductal gray of 129P3 versus C57BL/6 mice, owing to cis-acting genetic elements. The potential role of Kcnj9 was confirmed by the demonstration that knockout mice have attenuated analgesic responses. Conclusion A single locus is partially responsible for the genetic mediation of pain inhibition, and genetic variation associated with the potassium channel gene, Kcnj9, is a prime candidate for explaining the variable response to these analgesic drugs.

Serum concentrations of nerve growth factor and brain-derived neurotrophic factor in depressed patients before and after antidepressant treatment	PHARMACOPSYCHIATRY			English	Article							GLUCOCORTICOID-RECEPTOR EXPRESSION; TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; RAT-BRAIN; FACTOR BDNF; DIFFERENTIAL REGULATION; MESSENGER-RNA; ELECTROCONVULSIVE SEIZURES; TIME-COURSE; STRESS; HYPOTHESIS	Introduction: Stress, glucocorticoids and antidepressant treatment have been found to modulate the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and nerve growth factor (NGF). Recent research suggests that serum BDNF concentration is reduced in depression and that successful antidepressant treatment leads to an increase in serum BDNF concentration. Methods: We studied depressed patients receiving a standardized antidepressant treatment with either 150mg amitriptyline (n=20) or 40 mg paroxetine (n = 20) for 36 days in a prospective design. Changes in the concentrations of serum neurotrophins and salivary cortisol in response to antidepressant treatment were assessed. Results: Independent of clinical efficacy there was a significant 'treatment' by 'medication' interaction effect on BDNF serum concentrations that indicated a decline of BDNF by 12% in paroxetine-treated patients while there was an increase by 13% in amitriptyline-treated patients. Neither antidepressant altered NGF concentrations. The changes in cortisol and neurotrophin concentrations were not related. Discussion: Changes in BDNF serum concentrations as a result of antidepressant therapy depend on the antidepressant instead of being a general characteristic of response to antidepressant treatment.

One critical variable in the early environment is nutrition, and exposure to high fat (HF) in adulthood is known to change this DA system. Objectives We tested whether perinatal HF intake in rats could have long-term effects on DA function and behavior in adult offspring. Materials and methods Rat dams were fed either a control (5% fat, CD) or high fat (30% fat, HF) diet during the last week of gestation and lactation, and adult offspring were tested (PND 56-90) after weaning on CD. Locomotor responses to acute and repeated doses of D-amphetamine (AMP, 0.75 mg/kg bw) were determined as were indices of DA function in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), nucleus accumbens (NAc), and the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Results Adult HF offspring displayed increased tyrosine hydroxylase expression in the VTA and NAc and significant increases in DA and DOPAC content in the NAc, suggesting an elevated DA tone in this target field. In the NAc, there were no significant changes in D1, D2 receptors, or DA transporter (DAT) levels between diet groups. Perinatal HF feeding reduced AMP-induced locomotion and behavioral sensitization to AMP, suggesting that early diet might have caused long-lasting desensitization of postsynaptic receptor mechanisms in the NAc. Conclusions Our results demonstrate that both synthetic activity in VTA neurons and the responsiveness of accumbens DA neurons is altered by maternal nutrition. These effects subside long after termination of exposure to the HF diet.

Dream narratives of persons with ASD contained fewer emotional elements. In both groups, emotions correlated positively with slow Alpha (8.0-10.0 Hz) spectral power over parieto-occipital and left central regions, as well as with a right occipital EEG asymmetry. Slow Alpha activity in ASD individuals was lower over midline and parasagittal areas and higher over lateral areas compared to controls. Both groups displayed a right-biased slow Alpha activity for midparietal and occipital (significantly higher in control) sites. Results indicate that Alpha EEG activity may represent a neurophysiological substrate associated with emotional dream content. Distinctive Alpha EEG patterns and asymmetries suggest that dream generation implies different brain connectivity in ASD.

A closer look at the history and genetics of Tourette syndrome	SALUD MENTAL			English	Article						Tourette syndrome; Gilles de la Tourette syndrome; Georges Gilles de la Tourette; genetics of Tourette syndrome; tic disorder	DE-LA-TOURETTE; AUTOSOMAL-DOMINANT TRANSMISSION; OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE DISORDER; FAMILY-BASED ASSOCIATION; NEUROPSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS; LINKAGE DISEQUILIBRIUM; SEGREGATION ANALYSIS; MOVEMENT-DISORDERS; TIC DISORDERS; GILLES	Tourette syndrome (TS) was named after Georges Albert Edouard Brutus Gilles de la Tourette, who made its first formal description at the end of the 19(th) century. Nevertheless, some evidence indicates the disorder may have been recognised at least two thousand years ago. Tic like behaviours were recorded by Aretaeus of Cappadocia and several centuries later by Sprenger and Kraemer, followed by other descriptions. The English writer Samuel Johnson, author of the first English Language Dictionary, showed repetitive body twitches, facial grimaces, barks and grunts, among other tics. He was observed in situations such as going in or out at a door using a certain number of steps, from a certain point, which indicated he had also obsessive-compulsive behaviour. There was some evidence of features of TS as well as co-morbid conditions such as hyperactivity, obsessive-compulsive behaviour or rage attacks in other famous artists and world leaders. Some authors have even proposed that the creative, determined, competitive, and persistent nature of certain people may be related to the presence of TS. Clinicians have observed that some patients are particularly sensitive to the feelings and experiences of others, and more prone to outside stimuli. In this way, empathy could be a common quality in these patients. In 1825, Jean Marc Gaspard Itard made the first known medical description of TS based on two cases, one of which was later followed by Jean-Martin Charcot. In 1885 Gilles de la Tourette put together information from previous fragmented reports and wrote a complete and formal description, thus establishing a novel clinical entity. Behavioural abnormalities such as obsessions, compulsions, inattentiveness and hyperactivity, commonly observed in TS patients, were considered mental tics at the time. Current diagnostic criteria are very similar to Gilles de la Tourette's description. TS is characterized by the presence of multiple motor and one or more vocal tics. In this disorder, tics are not caused by the direct physiologic effects of a substance or a general medical condition. Tic symptomatology is persistent for over a year, and in this period, tics are not absent for more than three consecutive months. There is no exact consensus between the DSM-IV and the Tourette Syndrome Classification Study Group of whether the age of onset should be prior to 18 or 2 1 years of age, how cases of onset after 21 years should be diagnosed, and if marked distress or significant impairment caused by tics is necessary to define the condition as definite TS. However, the text revision of the DSM-IV (TR) no longer specifies that TS symptoms have to cause distress or impair the functioning of the patients. With respect to the age of onset, the ICD-10 Classification of Mental and Behavioural Disorders describes the onset almost always in childhood or adolescence, and in this way it would no longer exclude cases with later onset. Numerous studies confirmed in the 20(th) century that genetics plays an important role in the etiology of TS. Family studies proved that the disease runs in families. First-degree relatives of TS patients are indeed in greater risk for TS than the general population. Twin and adoption studies demonstrated that genes have an important role in the etiology of TS, and as much as 90% of the vulnerability to this syndrome could be affected by genes. In addition, environmental, epigenetic and even stochastic factors may affect the susceptibility to TS. At the molecular level, linkage in families and association in unrelated TS subjects hove been the main methods used to search for vulnerability genes. Sequencing of almost the entire human genome made it possible to assess the gene expression of thousands of genes on a single chip; recent studies reported a preliminary specific profile in the blood of TS patients. If confirmed, this finding could be useful in the identification of genetic factors related with TS. Given the multi-factorial nature of TS, a thorough clinical description in large samples should be considered; besides association, linkage and sequencing studies, possible gene-gene and gene-environment interactions would also need to be analysed, as well as epigenetic factors, and gene expression patterns.

Certain persons with Sz+SUD might in fact present better social and cognitive functioning than persons with Sz without SUD. This meta-analysis was conducted to verify this counterintuitive possibility and to determine whether factors such as substance type, severity or nature of psychotic symptoms and age of the patients help discriminate these subgroups. Twenty-three studies met the inclusion criteria and data from 1807 persons with schizophrenia, with or without comorbid SUD, were available for analyses. As a group, persons with Sz+ SUD did not obtain significantly higher scores at a Global Cognitive Index than persons with Sz without SUD, although they were better at the Trail Making Task and the speed processing domain. Secondary analyses showed the importance of considering intermediate factors, particularly the preferred substance used and the mean age. While consumption of alcohol was associated with a global cognitive scores similar to that of persons with Sz without an SUD and lower working memory capacities, preferential use of cannabis was instead associated with higher scores for problem solving and reasoning and visual memory. Age was inversely related to the size of the effects. It is concluded that previous mixed results obtained with cognitive evaluations of persons with Sz+SUD might reflect the heterogeneity of participants and that subgroups of patients might be defined on the basis of intermediate factors.

Genetic association studies of neurotensin gene and restless legs syndrome in French Canadians	SLEEP MEDICINE			English	Article						restless legs syndrome; neurotensin; genetic association study; mutational analysis; dopaminergic pathway; French Canadians	LIMB MOVEMENT-DISORDER; SUSCEPTIBILITY LOCUS; PRIMARY-CARE; RISK-FACTORS; POPULATION; PREVALENCE; EPIDEMIOLOGY; SLEEP; CONFIRMATION; SYMPTOMS	Background and purpose: The neurotensin gene (NTS), a known dopamine modulator, is located within the candidate region for the first genetic locus of restless legs syndrome (RLS1) on chromosome 12q. Though no causative mutation was found in selected patients in a previous mutation analysis, the involvement of NTS in RLS cannot be completely excluded as a potential positional and functional candidate gene. The purpose of the current study is to further explore the NTS gene for potential functional variant(s) in its entire genomic and potential regulatory regions and their possible association with RLS symptoms. Methods and subjects: We resequenced the coding regions and sequenced all the intronic and potential regulatory regions of the NTS gene in additional patients and controls. We carried out full scale gene-based case-control and family-based genetic association studies using the sequence variants detected during mutational analysis. Results: No coding or variants in regulatory and intronic regions compatible with a deleterious mutation were detected. Seven polymorphisms with elevated allele frequencies in the Caucasian Population did not show association with RLS in two independent case-control groups and 110 RLS families. Conclusion: The NTS gene on chromosome 12q is most unlikely to play a direct role in RLS etiology. Crown Copyright (C) 2007 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In addition to functional imaging studies, we believe that the identification of structural correlates of social cognitive processes may help to better understand the neural underpinnings of these specific skills. The main objective of this study was to investigate the relationship between gray matter density and social cognitive deficits in first episode of schizophrenia spectrum psychosis, using a comprehensive assessment that we previously demonstrated to be a highly sensitive measure of social cognitive deficits in this population. Thirty-eight patients with a first episode of psychosis participated in this study, and the Four Factor Test of Social Intelligence was used as a measure of social cognition. Social cognitive impairments in first episode psychosis were significantly correlated with reduced gray-matter density in the left middle frontal gyrus other regions within the mirror neuron system network (MSN), namely the right supplementary motor cortex, the left superior temporal gyrus and the left inferior parietal lobule. We concluded that structural abnormalities within the MSN may account for the social cognitive deficits present in some psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia.

Surgical management typically requires anterior decompression and reconstruction; however, these procedures can be associated with significant morbidity and mortality. PURPOSE: To evaluate the feasibility of anterior spinal column reconstruction using an expandable cage through a posterior approach. STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: Multicenter consecutive case series of 21 prospectively followed patients. PATIENT SAMPLE: Twenty-one patients with vertebral body tumors treated with anterior and posterior resection and reconstruction from a single posterior approach were followed prospectively. OUTCOME MEASURES: Pre- and postoperative neurologic status, number of levels instrumented and fused, length of surgery, length of stay after surgery, and complications related directly or indirectly to surgery were analyzed. In addition, pre- and postoperative radiographs, computed tomography (CT) scans, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were evaluated for involvement of the vertebral body and associated posterior elements. Particular attention was paid to the presence of either unilateral or bilateral pedicle and/or middle column involvement. METHODS: Patients were placed in a prone position on a rotating radiolucent table. Corpectomy was performed from an extracavitary approach, and anterior column reconstruction was completed with an expandable cage. The posterior tension band and spinal fusion was completed with segmental pedicle screw fixation and per-formed through the same posterior exposure. No patient required a separate anterior procedure. RESULTS: Patients' average age was 60.3 years (range, 17-78); there were 12 women and 9 men. Eighteen underwent single-level corpectomies (11 thoracic and 7 lumbar), and 3 underwent two-level corpectomies (T4-T5, T11-T12, and T12-L1). Average estimated blood loss (EBL) and length of surgery per level were 1,360 cc (range, 200-2,500) and 5.3 hours (range, 2.7-8.6), respectively. Average postoperative stay was 4.7 days. Nine patients had at least one partial motor grade improvement. One patient had postoperative left lower extremity weakness after surgical decompression and reconstruction secondary to iatrogenic nerve root traction but remained ambulatory. No chest tubes or postoperative bracing was required. At the most recent follow-up, six patients were alive at an average of 16.1 months (range, 3-33). For the 15 patients who died, the average life span after surgery was 6.8 months (range, 1-16). In addition to the iatrogenic nerve root injury, one cage required repositioning on postoperative Day 2 and one cage demonstrated radiographic evidence of settling but did not require surgical intervention; there were no deep venous thromboses (DVTs), pneumothoraces, pneumonias, ileus, or other complications, with a total complication rate of 14.3%. CONCLUSIONS: This is the largest study that specifically examines the use of an expandable cage through a posterior extracavitary approach for reconstruction after vertebral body tumor resection. The use of an expandable cage combined with an extracavitary approach is feasible and allows the surgeon to address both the anterior and posterior columns through a single incision. Although technically challenging, both one- and two-level corpectomies in the thoracic and/or lumbar spine can be performed with this technique. Furthermore, insertion of the expandable cage in the collapsed position and then expansion in situ after implantation allowed for all lumbar reconstructions to be completed without sacrificing any of the lumbar nerve roots. Our 14.3% complication rate is similar to those reported in anterior-alone and circumferential spinal procedures. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

For a first, well-known, series of instances, the average errors of the evolutionary and neural network heuristics are over 10% and more than 1000 times larger than that of VNS. For a second series, this error is about 3% while the errors of the parallel VNS and of a hybrid heuristic are about 0.01% and that of parallel scatter search even smaller.

To identify motifs implicated in Y-1 receptor desensitization and trafficking, mutants with varying C-terminal truncations or a substituted Y-2 C-terminus were constructed. Point mutations of key putative residues were made in a C-terminal conserved motif [phi-H-(S/T)-(E/D)-V-(S/T)-X-T] that we have identified and in the second intracellular i2 loop. Receptors were analyzed by functional assays, spectrofluorimetric measurements on living cells, flow cytometry, confocal imaging and bioluminescence resonance energy transfer assays for beta-arrestin activation and adaptor protein (AP-2) complex recruitment. Inhibitory GTP-binding protein-dependent signaling of Y-1 receptors to adenylyl cyclase and desensitization was unaffected by C-terminal truncations or mutations, while C-terminal deletion mutants of 42 and 61 amino acids no longer internalized. Substitutions of Thr357, Asp358, Ser360 and Thr362 by Ala in the C-terminus abolished both internalization and beta-arrestin activation but not desensitization. A Pro145 substitution by His in an i2 consensus motif reported to mediate phosphorylation-independent recruitment of beta-arrestins affected neither desensitization, internalization or recycling kinetics of activated Y-1 receptors nor beta-arrestin activation. Interestingly, combining Pro145 substitution by His and C-terminal substitutions significantly attenuates Y-1 desensitization. In the Y-2 receptor, replacement of His155 with Pro at this position in the i2 loop motif promotes agonist-mediated desensitization, beta-arrestin activation, internalization and recycling. Overall, our results indicate that beta-arrestin-mediated desensitization and internalization of Y-1 and Y-2 receptors are differentially regulated by the C-terminal motif and the i2 loop consensus motif.

Retroviral integration in the Gris1 locus causes an alternative splicing of the mouse cyclin D2 gene and expression of a truncated protein of 159 amino acids that is detected at high levels in the Gris1 tumors and also in normal mouse tissues mainly the brain and ovaries. A truncated form of the cyclin D2 was also found in human. We show here that both mouse- and human-truncated cyclin D2 are able to transform primary mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEF) when co-expressed with an activated Ras protein. The truncated cyclin D2 localizes only to the cytoplasm of transfected cells. It has retained the ability to interact with cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), although it is a poor catalyst of pRb phosphorylation. Interestingly, the presence of a similar, alternatively spliced cyclin D2 mRNA was also detected in some human brain tumors.

Lipid nanocapsules(LNC) inhibiting the P-gp pump efflux, were conjugated to OX26 monoclonal antibodies (OX26 MAb) and Fab' fragments. The OX26 MAb is directed against the transferrin receptor (TfR) highly expressed on the cerebral endothelium. The specific association of immunonanocapsules to rat brain capillary endothelial cells was demonstrated. Biodistribution of immunonanocapsules, labeled with a Re-188 lipophilic complex, was determined in healthy rats. At 24 h post-injection, the brain concentrations of Fab'-immunonanocapsules and OX26-immunonanocapsules were, respectively, 1.5 and 2-fold higher than non-targeted nanocapsules. In addition, Fab' fragments helped prolong the vascular residence time of the nanovectors but their affinity to TfR was lower than whole antibodies. The ability of immunonanocapsules to specifically target cerebral tissues in addition to the promising features of LNC is of importance to the field of nanomedicine. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Carboplatin-based regimens have demonstrated activity in pediatric patients with low-grade glioma (LGG). However, carboplatin hypersensitivity reaction (Cb HSR) represents a common and limiting factor for the continuation of therapy. METHODS. The objectives of this study were to describe the prevalence, characteristics, and management of Cb HSR and to detail their impact on outcome. The authors conducted a comprehensive, national, retrospective review of children who were diagnosed with LGG between 1985 and 2004 and received treatment with carboplatin. RESULTS. One hundred five patients from 10 Canadian centers were included. The median patient age at diagnosis was 3.5 years (range, 0.3-16.8 years), and 33 patients (31.4%) had neurofibromatosis type 1. Carboplatin was administered monthly in 46 children and weekly in 59 children. Forty-four patients (41.9%) developed Cb HSR after a median of 10.5 infusions (range, 3-39 infusions). Cb HSR occurred significantly earlier among children on the weekly schedule (4.4 months vs 9.1 months; P = .02). The first allergic reaction was grade I or 11 in 36 patients (82%). The cumulative incidence of Cb HSR increased with the number of infusions, and there was no evidence of a plateau. The only predictive factor was being a girl rather than a boy (P = .02). Thirty-four of 44 patients with Cb HSR were re-exposed to carboplatin, and 24 of 34 patients (70.5%) had recurrent Cb HSR. A desensitization approach did not provide any advantage compared with premedication alone for altering Cb HSR. The median number of additional Cb infusions delivered was 4 (range, 0.5-34 infusions). The effect of Cb HSR on the 5-year progression-free survival rate was not statistically significant (P = .1). CONCLUSIONS. Forty-two percent of children with LGG who received carboplatin regimens experienced Cb HSR. Most rechallenged children had recurrent Cb HSR despite Cb HSR-altering regimens. Cb HSR did not have an impact on progression-free survival.

Currently available MRI compatible dichoptic presentation systems are either highly expensive, require degradation of the projected stimulus such as the removal of all but one color or are difficult to deploy in a range of scanner environments. The system described here is relatively low in cost, requires no change in Stimulus properties and could be used in many types of scanner facilities. We provide a verification of the system demonstrating minimal cross-talk between the images presented to the two eyes. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

NeuriteTracer: A novel ImageJ plugin for automated quantification of neurite outgrowth	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Neurite outgrowth assay; automated tracing; ImageJ plugin	FLUORESCENCE MICROSCOPY IMAGES; AXONAL REGENERATION; RHO-GTPASES; CNS MYELIN; INHIBITION; RECEPTOR; PHOSPHATASE; NEURONS; KINASE; GROWTH	In vitro assays to measure neuronal growth are a fundamental tool used by many neurobiologists studying neuronal development and regeneration. The quantification of these assays requires accurate measurements of neurite length and neuronal cell numbers in neuronal cultures. Generally, these measurements are obtained through labor-intensive manual or semi-manual tracing of images. To automate these measurements, we have written NeuriteTracer, a neurite tracing plugin for the freely available image-processing program ImageJ. The plugin analyzes fluorescence microscopy images of neurites and nuclei of dissociated cultured neurons. Given user-defined thresholds, the plugin counts neuronal nuclei, and traces and measures neurite length. We find that NeuriteTracer accurately measures neurite outgrowth from cerebellar, DRG and hippocampal neurons. Values obtained by NeuriteTracer correlate strongly with those obtained by semi-manual tracing with NeuronJ and by using a sophisticated analysis package. MetaXpress. We reveal the utility of NeuriteTracer by demonstrating its ability to detect the neurite outgrowth promoting capacity of the rho kinase inhibitor Y-27632. Our plugin is an attractive alternative to existing tracing tools because it is fully automated and ready for use within a freely accessible imaging program. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Striatal dopamine transmission in healthy humans during a passive monetary reward task	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; NUCLEUS-ACCUMBENS DOPAMINE; SUBSTANTIA NIGRA; DORSAL STRIATUM; C-11 RACLOPRIDE; RELEASE; AMPHETAMINE; RESPONSES; NEURONS; STRESS	Research on dopamine (DA) transmission has emphasized the importance of increased phasic DA cell firing in the presence of unpredictable rewards. Using [C-11]raclopride PET, we previously reported that DA transmission was both suppressed and enhanced in different regions of the striatum during an unpredictable reward task [Zald, D.H., Boileau, I., El Dearedy, W., Gunn, R., McGlone, F., Dichter, G.S. et al. (2004). Dopamine transmission in the human striatum during monetary reward tasks. J. Neurosci. 24, 4105-4112]. However, it was unclear if reductions in DA release during this task reflected a response to the high proportion of nonrewarding trials, and whether the behavioral demands of the task influenced the observed response. To test these issues, we presented 10 healthy subjects with an automated (passive) roulette wheel game in which the amount of reward and its timing were unpredictable and the rewarding trials greatly outnumbered the nonrewarding ones. As in the previous study, DA transmission in the putamen was significantly suppressed relative to a predictable control condition. A similar suppression occurred when subjects were presented with temporally unpredictable novel pictures and sounds. At present, models of DA functioning during reward do not account for this suppression, but given that it has been observed in two different studies using different reward paradigms, this phenomenon warrants attention. Neither the unpredictable reward nor the novelty conditions produced consistent increases in striatal DA transmission. These data suggest that active behavioral engagement may be necessary to observe robust statewise increases in DA release in the striatum. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

HERMES Trial Grp	B-cell depletion with Rituximab in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis	NEW ENGLAND JOURNAL OF MEDICINE			English	Article							PLACEBO-CONTROLLED TRIAL; CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; DOUBLE-BLIND; RHEUMATOID-ARTHRITIS; MONOCLONAL-ANTIBODY; CEREBROSPINAL-FLUID; CLONAL EXPANSION; NATURAL-HISTORY; IN-VIVO; MULTICENTER	Background: There is increasing evidence that B lymphocytes are involved in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis, and they may be a therapeutic target. Rituximab, a monoclonal antibody, selectively targets and depletes CD20+ B lymphocytes. Methods: In a phase 2, double-blind, 48-week trial involving 104 patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, we assigned 69 patients to receive 1000 mg of intravenous rituximab and 35 patients to receive placebo on days 1 and 15. The primary end point was the total count of gadolinium-enhancing lesions detected on magnetic resonance imaging scans of the brain at weeks 12, 16, 20, and 24. Clinical outcomes included safety, the proportion of patients who had relapses, and the annualized rate of relapse. Results: As compared with patients who received placebo, patients who received rituximab had reduced counts of total gadolinium-enhancing lesions at weeks 12, 16, 20, and 24 (P<0.001) and of total new gadolinium-enhancing lesions over the same period (P<0.001); these results were sustained for 48 weeks (P<0.001). As compared with patients in the placebo group, the proportion of patients in the rituximab group with relapses was significantly reduced at week 24 (14.5% vs. 34.3%, P=0.02) and week 48 (20.3% vs. 40.0%, P=0.04). More patients in the rituximab group than in the placebo group had adverse events within 24 hours after the first infusion, most of which were mild-to-moderate events; after the second infusion, the numbers of events were similar in the two groups. Conclusions: A single course of rituximab reduced inflammatory brain lesions and clinical relapses for 48 weeks. This trial was not designed to assess long-term safety or to detect uncommon adverse events. The data provide evidence of B-cell involvement in the pathophysiology of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00097188.).

We therefore overexpressed globally the potassium-chloride cotransporter 2 (KCC2) in newly fertilized zebrafish embryos to reverse the chloride gradient. This rendered glycine hyperpolarizing in all neurons, tested at the time that motor behaviors (but not native KCC2) first appear. KCC2 overexpression resulted in fewer mature spontaneously active spinal neurons, more immature silent neurons, and disrupted motor activity. We observed fewer motoneurons and interneurons, a reduction in the elaboration of axonal tracts, and smaller brains and spinal cords. However, we observed no increased apoptosis and a normal complement of sensory neurons, glia, and progenitors. These results suggest that chloride-mediated excitation plays a crucial role in promoting neurogenesis from the earliest stages of embryonic development.

In addition, these receptors can become exposed to ROS during the progression of certain neurodegenerative diseases. Because ROS are known to modify several membrane proteins, including some types of ion channels, it raises the question of whether elevations in cytosolic ROS alter the function of nAChRs. To address this, we elevated ROS in cultured sympathetic neurons, directly by perfusing neurons intracellularly with ROS, indirectly by blocking the mitochondrial electron transport chain, or noninvasively by transient NGF removal; we then simultaneously measured changes in cytosolic ROS levels and whole-cell ACh-evoked currents. In addition, we elevated cytosolic ROS in postganglionic neurons in intact ganglia and measured changes in nerve-evoked EPSPs. Our experiments indicate that mild elevations in cytosolic ROS, including that produced by transient interruption of NGF signaling, induce a use-dependent, long-lasting rundown of ACh-evoked currents on cultured sympathetic neurons and a long-lasting depression of fast nerve-evoked EPSPs. We show that these effects of cytosolic ROS are specific to nAChRs on neurons and do not cause rundown of ACh-evoked currents on muscle. Our results demonstrate that elevations in cytosolic ROS inactivate neuronal nAChRs in a use-dependent manner and suggest that mild oxidative stress impairs mechanisms mediated by cholinergic nicotinic signaling at neuronal-neuronal synapses.

Electrolytic lesions of the habenula attenuate brain stimulation reward	BEHAVIOURAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						self-stimulation; reward; habenula; ventral tegmental area; lateral hypothalamus; dorsal raphe; median raphe	MEDIAL FOREBRAIN-BUNDLE; INTRACRANIAL SELF-STIMULATION; FOS-LIKE IMMUNOREACTIVITY; DOPAMINE TERMINAL FIELDS; VENTRAL TEGMENTAL AREA; BASAL FOREBRAIN; PARA-CHLOROPHENYLALANINE; MESENCEPHALIC SUBSTRATE; ANATOMICAL LINKAGE; REFRACTORY PERIODS	The present experiment used electrolytic lesions in combination with curve-shift scaling to study the functional relation between the habenula and four different brain sites that support operant responding for brain stimulation reward. Rats were implanted with a monopolar stimulation electrode aimed at the lateral hypothalamus, ventral tegmental area, dorsal raphe or median raphe nuclei, and a lesioning electrode in the ipsilateral habenula. Operant nose poking resulted in self-administration of trains of electrical pulses to one of the above stimulation sites. Reward thresholds were derived from response-number curves and defined as the pulse number necessary for half-maximal responding. Rats were tested daily at each of three current intensities that were chosen from individual number-current trade-off functions and that yielded baseline reward thresholds of approximately 10, 20 and 40 pulses/train. Testing resumed 24 h after lesioning the habenula (100 mu A anodal current, 20-25 s) and continued for 3-4 weeks. A total of 19 rats completed the experiment. In five of these, habenular lesions clearly reduced the rewarding effectiveness of the stimulation; reward thresholds increased by approximately 30-245% (0.12-0.54 log(10) units). Generally, lesion effects were observed at low and medium current intensities, developed gradually and did not recover. Histological analysis revealed that in two rats the stimulation electrode was located in the posterior lateral hypothalamus, two in the anterior ventral tegmental area and one in the area of the dorsal raphe. These results strongly suggest that the habenula constitutes an important component of the neural circuitry important for brain stimulation reward. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

There was a significant loss of pyramidal CA1 neurons in ischemic compared to sham-operated rats but no difference between the ad lib and food-restricted ischemic animals. Although the diet did not influence neuronal damage in ischemic animals, the performance of food-restricted ischemic rats in spatial task such as the radial arm maze was significantly better than that of ad lib fed ischemic rats. Food-restricted ischemic rats made equivalent numbers of working memory errors as sham-operated animals and took the same time to complete a standard 8-arm radial arm maze task. They also displayed higher activity level in the open field compared to ad libitum fed ischemic rats, and spent considerably more time in the open arms of the elevated plus maze compared to the other groups, suggesting decreased anxiety in these ischemic rats. The relative sparing of spatial memory performance in food-restricted ischemic animals suggests that food restriction facilitates functional recovery. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The final portion of aiming movements is particularly affected in HD and one hypothesis is that this deficit is linked to attention or terminal control requirements. Sixteen patients with early HD and 16 age-matched controls were examined in aiming movements. Four conditions manipulated movement termination requirements (discrete movements with a complete stop vs. cyclical back-and-forth movements) and the presence of flankers around the target. Reducing movement termination requirements significantly attenuated deficits in the final movement phase in patients. The presence of flankers around the target affected the initial portion of movements but did not affect the two groups differentially. These results indicate that terminal control requirements affect voluntary movements in HD. This suggests that frontostriatal systems are involved in movement termination. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Mild deficiency of MTHFR is common in many populations and modifies risk for several complex traits including vascular disease, birth defects, and cancer. We recently demonstrated that MTHFR can be up-regulated by NF-kappa B, an important mediator of cell survival that is activated by endoplasmic reticulum ( ER) stress. This observation, coupled with the reports that homocysteine can induce ER stress, prompted us to examine the possible regulation of MTHFR by ER stress. We found that several well characterized stress inducers ( tunicamycin, thapsigargin, and A23187) as well as homocysteine could increase Mthfr mRNA and protein in Neuro-2a cells. The induction of MTHFR was also observed after overexpression of inositol-requiring enzyme-1 (IRE1) and was inhibited by a dominant-negative mutant of IRE1. Because IRE1 triggers c-Jun signaling, we examined the possible involvement of c-Jun in up-regulation of MTHFR. Transfection of c-Jun and two activators of c-Jun (LiCl and sodium valproate) increased MTHFR expression, whereas a reported inhibitor of c-Jun (SP600125) and a dominant-negative derivative of c-Jun N-terminal kinase-1 reduced MTHFR activation. We conclude that ER stress increases MTHFR expression and that IRE1 and c-Jun mediate this activation. These findings provide a novel mechanism by which the ER can regulate homeostasis and allude to an important role for MTHFR in cell survival.

The effect of middle temporal spike phase on sensory encoding and correlates with behavior during a motion-detection task	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			Rumanian	Article						spike phase; behavior; oscillations; MT; motion; macaque monkey	PRIMARY VISUAL-CORTEX; PERCEPTUAL DECISION-MAKING; COINCIDENCE DETECTION; AREA MT; NEURONAL RESPONSES; INFORMATION-TRANSMISSION; ATTENTIONAL MODULATION; ODOR REPRESENTATIONS; MACAQUE MONKEYS; NEURAL ACTIVITY	Previous studies have shown that sensory neurons that are the most informative of the stimulus tend to be the best correlated with the subject's perceptual decision. We wanted to know whether this relationship might also apply to short time segments of a neuron's response. We asked whether spikes that conveyed more information about a motion stimulus were also more tightly linked to the perceptual behavior. We examined single-neuron activity in middle temporal (MT) area while monkeys performed a motion-detection task. Because of a slow stimulus update (every 27 ms), activity in many MT neurons was entrained and phase-locked to the stimulus. These stimulus-entrained neuronal oscillations allowed us to separate spikes based on phase. We observed a large amount of variability in how spikes at different phases of the oscillation encoded the stimulus, as revealed by the spike-triggered average of the motion. Spikes during certain phases of the cycle weremuchmore informative about the presence of coherent motion than others. Importantly, we found that the phases that were the most informative about the motion stimulus were also more correlated with the behavioral performance and reaction time of the animal. Our results suggest that the relationship between a neuron's spikes, the stimulus, and behavior can vary on a time scale of tens of milliseconds.

In addition to cholinergic and GABAergic neurons, glutamatergic neurons and neurons that can corelease acetylcholine and glutamate have recently been described in the basal forebrain. Although it is well known that nerve growth factor (NGF) promotes synaptic function of cholinergic basal forebrain neurons, how NGF affects the newly identified basal forebrain neurons remains undetermined. Here, we examined the effects of NGF on synaptic transmission of medial septum and diagonal band of Broca (MS-DBB) neurons expressing different neurotransmitter phenotypes. We used MS-DBB neurons from 10- to 13-d-old rats, cultured on astrocytic microislands to promote the development of autaptic connections. Evoked and spontaneous postsynaptic currents were recorded, and neurotransmitters released were characterized pharmacologically. We found that chronic exposure to NGF significantly increased acetylcholine and glutamate release from cholinergic MS-DBB neurons, whereas glutamate and GABA transmission from noncholinergic MS-DBB neurons were not affected by NGF. Interestingly, the NGF-induced increase in neurotransmission was mediated by p75(NTR). These results demonstrate a previously unidentified role of NGF and its receptor p75NTR; their interactions are crucial for cholinergic and glutamatergic transmission in the septohippocampal pathway.

Unchanged density of 5-HT1A autoreceptors on the plasma membrane of nucleus raphe dorsalis neurons in rats chronically treated with fluoxetine	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						fluoxetine; 5-HT1A autoreceptors; desensitization; internalization; immunogold; [F-18]MPPF	ANTIDEPRESSANT DRUG-TREATMENT; IN-VIVO MICRODIALYSIS; KNOCK-OUT MICE; MAJOR DEPRESSION; FRONTAL-CORTEX; EXTRACELLULAR SEROTONIN; MESSENGER-RNA; NEUROENDOCRINE RESPONSES; DIFFERENTIAL REGULATION; REGIONAL DIFFERENCES	5-HT1A autoreceptors regulate the firing of 5-HT neurons and their release of 5-HT. In previous immuno-electron microscopic studies, we have demonstrated an internalization of 5-HT, autoreceptors in the nucleus raphe dorsalis (NRD) of rats, after the acute administration of a single dose of the specific agonist 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamine)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) or of the selective 5-HT reuptake inhibitor, fluoxetine. Twenty-four hours after either treatment, the receptors were back in normal density on the plasma membrane of NRD neurons. Here, we examined the subcellular localization of these receptors and the in vivo binding of the 5-HT1A radioligand 4,2-(methoxyphenyl)-1-[2-(N-2-pyridinyl)-p-fluorobenzamido]ethylpiperazine labeled with [F-18]fluorine ([F-18]MPPF) after chronic fluoxetine treatment (10 mg/kg daily for 3 weeks, by minipump). Unexpectedly, after such a treatment, there were no more differences between treated and control rats in either the density of plasma membrane labeling of NRD dendrites, or in the in vivo binding of [F-18]MPPF, as measured with beta-microprobes. This was in keeping with earlier reports of an unchanged density of 5-HT1A receptor binding sites after chronic fluoxetine treatment, but quite unexpected from the strong electrophysiological and biochemical evidence for a desensitization of 5-HT1A autoreceptors under such conditions. Indeed, when the fluoxetine-treated rats were challenged with a single dose of 8-OH-DPAT, there was no internalization of the 5-HT1A autoreceptors, at variance with the controls. Interestingly, several laboratories have reported an uncoupling of 5-HT1A autoreceptors from their G protein in the NRD of rats chronically treated with fluoxetine. Therefore, the best explanation for our results is that, after repeated internalization and retargeting, functional 5-HT1A autoreceptors are replaced by receptors uncoupled from their G protein on the plasma membrane of NRD 5-HT neurons. Thus, the regulatory function of these autoreceptors may depend on a dynamic balance among their production, activation, internalization and recycling to the plasma membrane in inactivated (desensitized) form.

Sumatriptan normalizes the migraine attack-related increase in brain serotonin synthesis	NEUROLOGY			English	Article							POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; EVOKED CORTICAL POTENTIALS; GENE REGULATORY REGION; INTENSITY DEPENDENCE; 5-HT1B/(1D) RECEPTOR; MOTION SICKNESS; ZOLMITRIPTAN; POLYMORPHISM; HABITUATION; FREQUENCY	Background: Altered serotonin (5-HT) neurotransmission has been implicated in the pathophysiology of migraine headache. Objectives: To test this hypothesis in migraine patients in vivo using PET and alpha-[C-11] methyl-L-tryptophan as a surrogate marker of brain 5-HT synthetic rate during different phases of their migraine attack and after acute antimigraine therapy with sumatriptan, and to compare them with normal controls. Methods: Six patients were scanned 1) within 6 hours after the onset of a spontaneous migraine attack, 2) 2hours after subcutaneous sumatriptan, and 3) interictally when migraine free for at least 3 days. Head pain was rated before each scan, and before and every 15 minutes after sumatriptan. Results: Brain 5-HT synthesis was highest during attacks, lowest after sumatriptan, and intermediate when patients were migraine free. All states were statistically different from the others in virtually all brain regions examined. 5-HT synthetic rates in patients during migraine attacks did not differ from those of age-and sex-matched controls, whereas they were significantly lower after sumatriptan in a majority of regions. Interictally, global brain 5-HT synthetic rate was slightly, albeit not significantly, lower (-14%) in migraine patients than in controls, with specific cortical areas exhibiting proportionally more severe reductions (-28% to 31%). Conclusions: These findings point to a low cortical serotonergic tone in migraine patients interictally. Further, they demonstrate widespread increases in brain serotonin (5-HT) synthetic rate in migraine patients during attacks, and that triptans exert a negative feedback regulation of brain 5-HT synthesis concurrently with modulation of pain pathways.

Neuropsychiatric symptom clusters and functional disability in cognitively-impaired-not-demented individuals	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF GERIATRIC PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						neuropsychiatric symptoms; functional disability; cognitive impairment	ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; CIND INDIVIDUALS; CANADIAN COHORT; PREVALENCE; HEALTH	Objective: Previous research has shown that cognitively-impaired-not-demented (CIND) individuals with at least one neuropsychiatric symptom (NPS) have more functional disability than individuals without any NPSs. The objectives of the present study were to determine whether there are consistent clusters of NPS in CIND individuals and whether certain NPS clusters are more strongly associated with measures of functional disability than other NPS clusters in this population. Methods: This was a cross-sectional baseline study of NPS using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) in a national clinic-based observational cohort study (the Canadian Cohort Study of Cognitive Impairment and Related Dementias study). The present investigation focuses on a subset of CIND subjects (73%) whose informant endorsed the presence of at least one NPI item. Results: A hierarchical cluster analysis identified two NPS clusters. One consisted of mood factors (i. e., depression, anxiety, apathy, irritability, and problems with sleep) and the other cluster captured frontal symptoms (i. e., aberrant motor behavior, disinhibition, agitation, and problems with appetite). NPSs grouped within the mood cluster were more common than the frontal cluster (95% of subjects had at least one NPS within the mood cluster versus 53% in the frontal cluster). However, the frontal cluster was more strongly associated with functional disability measures even after controlling for cognitive status (i.e., the Mini-Mental State Exam) and the mood cluster score. Conclusion: The frontal cluster of NPSs was more strongly associated with functional disability than the mood cluster.

Attenuation of the 40-hertz auditory steady state response by propofol involves the cortical and subcortical generators	ANESTHESIOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	33rd Annual Meeting of the Society-for-Neuroscience	NOV 08-12, 2003	NEW ORLEANS, LA	Soc Neurosci			EVOKED-POTENTIALS; INFERIOR COLLICULUS; INTRACEREBRAL SOURCES; SUSTAINED POTENTIALS; BISPECTRAL INDEX; HUMAN VOLUNTEERS; TEMPORAL CORTEX; ANESTHESIA; INFORMATION; ISOFLURANE	Background: The 40-Hz auditory steady state response (40-Hz ASSR) provides a reliable marker of anesthetic-induced unconsciousness. Brain electric source analysis indicates that the 40-Hz ASSR arises from cortical and subcortical generators. The authors used source analysis to assess the effect of propofol anesthesia on the cerebral generators of the 40-Hz ASSR. They also examined the effect of propofol on two auditory evoked potentials of cortical origin: the NI and the sustained potential. Methods: Eleven healthy human volunteers were anesthetized with propofol given in target-concentration mode at the minimal concentration causing unconsciousness. The 40-Hz ASSR was recorded before, during, and after anesthesia. The source model consisted of five concurrently active generator dipoles: two in the contralateral auditory cortex (one tangentially oriented, one radially oriented), two in the ipsilateral auditory cortex (same orientations), and one in the midline brainstem. Results: During anesthesia, the strength of the cortical and brainstem dipoles was reduced to the same extent (to 54% of baseline for the four cortical dipoles pooled vs. 53% for the brainstem dipole). Dipole strength during anesthesia was significantly less (P < 0.01) than during baseline and recovery for both cortical and brainstem dipoles. The NI and sustained potential were no longer recordable during anesthesia. Conclusions: The attenuation of the 40-Hz ASSR during propofol anesthesia results from a reduction of similar magnitude of the activity of the cortical and brainstem generators. The N1 and sustained potential are so profoundly attenuated during propofol anesthesia that they are no longer recordable from the scalp.

Canadian MSBMT Study Grp	Magnetization transfer ratio evolution with demyelination and remyelination in multiple sclerosis lesions	ANNALS OF NEUROLOGY			English	Article							CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; EXPERIMENTAL ALLERGIC ENCEPHALOMYELITIS; RESONANCE-IMAGING FINDINGS; MYELIN BASIC-PROTEIN; MS LESIONS; CEREBELLAR PEDUNCLE; ENHANCING LESIONS; WHITE-MATTER; TRANSFER MR; BRAIN	Objective: To assess demyelination and remyelination in vivo in acute gadolinium (Gd)-enhancing lesions of multiple sclerosis (MS). Methods: We measured significant changes in magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) consistent with demyelination and remyelination of individual lesion voxels, as well as the mean normalized MTR over all lesion voxels during and after contrast enhancement, in MS patients participating in a 3-year Canadian trial assessing immunoablation and autologous stem cell transplantation for treatment of MS. Results: The average mean normalized lesion MTR over all lesions exhibited partial recovery over 2 to 4 months after Gd enhancement. Voxel-based analysis demonstrated that approximately 70% of the initially enhancing lesion volume (GdLV) was left with stably low MTR over 39 months of evaluation. The percentage of the GdLV undergoing significant increases in MTR consistent with remyelination increased for approximately 7 months after enhancement and then stabilized at 21 %GdLV. Significant decreases in MTR consistent with demyelination were ongoing for approximately 33 months after enhancement, stabilizing at 9 %GdLV. The estimated error of these measurements, based on scan/rescan analysis, was less than 0.4 %GdLV. Interpretation: We found significant changes in MTR consistent with demyelination and remyelination that followed different temporal evolutions and were ongoing in different lesion regions for at least 3 years after lesion formation.

Random fields of multivariate test statistics, with applications to shape analysis	ANNALS OF STATISTICS			English	Article						integral geometry; differential topology; Euler characteristic; Morse theory; Roy's maximum root; Hotelling's T-2; canonical correlation; scale space	EXCURSION SETS; TAIL PROBABILITIES; UNKNOWN LOCATION; CONFIDENCE BANDS; GAUSSIAN FIELDS; MAXIMA; REGRESSION; GEOMETRY; FORMULA; SIGNALS	Our data are random fields of multivariate Gaussian observations, and we fit a multivariate linear model with common design matrix at each point. We are interested in detecting those points where some of the coefficients are nonzero using classical multivariate statistics evaluated at each point. The problem is to find the P-value of the maximum of such a random field of test statistics. We approximate this by the expected Euler characteristic of the excursion set. Our main result is a very simple method for calculating this, which not only gives us the previous result of Cao and Worsley [Ann. Statist. 27 (1999) 925-942] for Hotelling's T-2, but also random fields of Roy's maximum root, maximum canonical correlations [Ann. Appl. Probab. 9 (1999) 1021-1057], multilinear forms [Ann. Statist. 29 (2001) 328-371], chi(-2) [Statist. Probab. Lett 32 (1997) 367-376, Ann. Statist. 25 (1997) 2368-2387] and chi(2) scale space [Adv. in Appl. Probab. 33 (2001) 773-793]. The trick involves approaching the problem from the point of view of Roy's union-intersection principle. The results are applied to a problem in shape analysis where we look for brain damage due to nonmissile trauma.	[Taylor, J. E.] Stanford Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Taylor, J.

Variations in heritability of cortisol reactivity to stress as a function of early familial adversity among 19-month-old twins	ARCHIVES OF GENERAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Article							SALIVARY CORTISOL; ADRENOCORTICAL RESPONSES; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; SOCIOEMOTIONAL ADJUSTMENT; NEUROENDOCRINE ACTIVITY; CLINICAL-IMPLICATIONS; SOCIOECONOMIC-STATUS; MALTREATED CHILDREN; ATTACHMENT SECURITY; INFANT TEMPERAMENT	Context: Cortisol reactivity is a marker of vulnerability for a variety of stress-related diseases that likely arise from the contributions of both genetic and environmental sources of influence. However, little is known about gene-environment interplay in early cortisol reactivity. Objectives: To examine the genetic and environmental contributions to early cortisol reactivity in a population-based sample of 19-month-old twins and to determine whether these contributions vary as a function of early familial adversity. Design: A variant of the twin method, with genetic and environment contributions to cortisol reactivity estimated as a function of familial adversity. Familial adversity was defined as the presence of 7 risk factors during perinatal and postnatal development (eg, at 6 and 19 months of age): maternal smoking during pregnancy, low birth weight, low family income, low maternal educational level, single parenthood, young motherhood, and maternal hostile or reactive behaviors. Twins exposed to 4 or more risk factors at either time were considered as having been exposed to high (vs low) familial adversity (23.4% of the sample). Setting: Centre de Recherche Fernand-Seguin at the Ho-pital Louis-Hyppolite Lafontaine, Montreal, Quebec. Patients: Participants were families of twins from the Quebec Newborn Twin Study recruited between April 1, 1995, and December 31, 1998, in the greater Montre al area. A total of 346 twins, 130 monozygotic and 216 dizygotic, were included in the study. Main Outcome Measures: Salivary cortisol samples were collected before and after the participating twins had been exposed to unfamiliar situations; change in cortisol over time was used as a measure of cortisol reactivity. Results: Distinct patterns of genetic and environmental contributions to cortisol reactivity were evidenced as a function of familial adversity, suggesting a possible gene-environment interplay. In low-familial adversity settings that characterized most families, both genetic and unique but not shared environmental factors accounted for individual differences in cortisol reactivity, with shared genes explaining the similarity observed within twin pairs. By contrast, inconditions of high familial adversity, both shared and unique environmental factors, but not genetic factors, accounted for the variance in cortisol reactivity. Conclusion: This pattern of differing genetic and environmental contributions according to familial adversity suggests that, early in life, high familial adversity may have a programming developmental effect on cortisol reactivity.
