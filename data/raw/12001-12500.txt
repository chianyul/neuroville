The peptidergic population expresses neuropeptides such as substance P (SP) and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and has both cutaneous and visceral targets. The nonpeptidergic population expresses the purinergic receptor P2X(3), binds the isolectin B4 (IB4), and innervates mainly the epidermis. To date, the peptidergic nociceptor population in cutaneous tissue of the rat has been well characterized, whereas the nonpeptidergic innervation pattern has lacked an adequate description. To this aim, we used light microscopic immunocytochemistry to investigate the pattern of P2X(3)-immunoreactive (-IR) fiber innervation of both hairy and glabrous skin from male Sprague-Dawley rats. Our results show extensive P2X(3)-IR fibers throughout the upper and lower dermis. Thick bundles of P2X(3)-IR fibers were found to run in parallel with the dermal-epidermal junction and projected multiple thin collateral axons that penetrated the epidermal layer, creating a dense network of innervation throughout the entire epidermis. The distribution of P2X(3)-IR fibers in the epidermis was far more extensive than the distribution of CGRP-IR fibers. P2X(3)-IR fibers also innervate hair follicles but were rarely found in close proximity to glands and blood vessels. The present results suggest a primary role for P2X(3)-IR fibers in the detection of noxious stimuli in cutaneous tissue and provide an anatomical basis for future studies examining a possible functionally distinct role of nonpeptidergic nociceptors in the transmission of nociceptive signals.

The A539T substitution in BChE-K is located at the C terminus, which is essential both for BChE tetramerization and for its capacity to attenuate beta-amyloid (A beta) fibril formation. Here, we report that BChE-K is inherently unstable as compared with the "usual" BChE (BChE-U), resulting in reduced hydrolytic activity and predicting prolonged acetylcholine maintenance and protection from AD. A synthetic peptide derived from the C terminus of BChE-K (BSP-K), which displayed impaired intermolecular interactions, was less potent in suppressing A beta oligomerization than its BSP-U counterpart. Correspondingly, highly purified recombinant human rBChE-U monomers suppressed beta-amyloid fibril formation less effectively than dimers, which also protected cultured neuroblastoma cells from A beta neurotoxicity. Dual activity structurally derived changes due to the A539T substitution can thus account for both neuroprotective characteristics caused by sustained acetylcholine levels and elevated AD risk due to inefficient interference with amyloidogenic processes.

Brain glucocorticoid receptors are necessary for the rhythmic expression of the clock protein, PERIOD2, in the central extended amygdala in mice	NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS			English	Article						Basolateral amygdala; Central nucleus of the amygdala; Circadian rhythms; Dentate gyrus; Oval nucleus of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis; Suprachiasmatic nucleus	PERIPHERAL-TISSUES; STRIA TERMINALIS; OVAL NUCLEUS; BED NUCLEUS; COLOCALIZATION; OSCILLATOR; MPER1; GENE	The adrenal glucocorticoid, corticosterone, induces changes in gene expression in both neural and non-neural tissues. The rhythmic release of corticosterone has been shown in rats to be necessary for the rhythmic expression of the clock protein PERIOD2 (PER2) in select regions of the limbic forebrain. The mechanisms mediating the effects of glucocorticoids on changes in gene expression have been linked to the transcriptional activity of the low affinity glucocorticoid receptor, GR. We examined the patterns of PER2 expression in the brains of mice containing an inactivation of GR gene restricted to neural tissues (GR(NesCre) mice). We found that central deletion of the GR gene blunts the daily pattern of PER2 expression in the oval nucleus of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNSTov)and central nucleus of the amygdala (CEA) both of which make up the central extended amygdala, but not in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), basolateral amygdala (BLA) or dentate gyrus of the hippocampus (DG). These results implicate brain GR receptors in the regulation of PER2 expression in the BNSTov and CEA and are consistent with our previous findings that the rhythmic expression of PER2 in these areas is selectively sensitive to fluctuations in circulating corticosterone.

Synapse- and Stimulus-Specific Local Translation During Long-Term Neuronal Plasticity	SCIENCE			English	Article							APLYSIA SENSORY NEURONS; PROTEIN-SYNTHESIS; MESSENGER-RNAS; HIPPOCAMPAL-NEURONS; MEMORY STORAGE; FACILITATION; EXPRESSION; LOCALIZATION; IDENTIFICATION; POLYRIBOSOMES	Long-term memory and synaptic plasticity require changes in gene expression and yet can occur in a synapse-specific manner. Messenger RNA localization and regulated translation at synapses are thus critical for establishing synapse specificity. Using live-cell microscopy of photoconvertible fluorescent protein translational reporters, we directly visualized local translation at synapses during long-term facilitation of Aplysia sensory-motor synapses. Translation of the reporter required multiple applications of serotonin, was spatially restricted to stimulated synapses, was transcript-and stimulus-specific, and occurred during long-term facilitation but not during long-term depression of sensory-motor synapses. Translational regulation only occurred in the presence of a chemical synapse and required calcium signaling in the postsynaptic motor neuron. Thus, highly regulated local translation occurs at synapses during long-term plasticity and requires trans-synaptic signals.

Methods: The Quebec Cerebral Palsy Registry was utilized to identify children over a 4-year birth interval (1999-2002 inclusive) with cerebral palsy. Information on neurologic subtype classified according to the qualitative nature and topographic distribution of the motor impairment on neurologic examination, Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) categorization of motor skills, and the presence of certain comorbidities (cortical blindness, auditory limitations, nonverbal communication skills, gavage feeding status, and coexisting afebrile seizures in the prior 12 months) was obtained. Results: The frequency of individual comorbidities, their proportional distribution, and mean number of occurrences basically falls into a significant dichotomous distribution. Across the spectrum of comorbidities considered, these comorbidities are relatively infrequently encountered in those with spastic hemiplegic or spastic diplegic variants or ambulatory GMFCS status (levels I-III), while these entities occur at a frequent level for those with spastic quadriplegic, dyskinetic, or ataxic-hypotonic variants or nonambulatory GMFCS status (levels IV and V). Conclusion: The enhanced burdens of comorbidity are unevenly distributed in children with cerebral palsy in a manner that can be associated with either a specific neurologic subtype (spastic quadriplegic, dyskinetic, ataxic-hypotonic) or nonambulatory motor status (Gross Motor Function Classification System levels IV and V). This provides enhanced value to the utilization of these classification approaches.

The risks and costs of multiple-generic substitution of topiramate	NEUROLOGY			English	Article							ANTIEPILEPTIC DRUGS; LAMOTRIGINE; CONSEQUENCES; EPILEPSY	Objective: To investigate clinical and economic consequences following generic substitution of one vs multiple generics of topiramate (Topamax; Ortho-McNeil Neurologics, Titusville, NJ). Methods: Medical and pharmacy claims data of Regie de l'Assurance-Maladie du Que'bec from January 2006 to October 2007 were used. Patients with epilepsy treated with topiramate were selected. An open-cohort design was used to classify the observation period into periods of brand, single-generic, and multiple-generic use. One-year generic-switch and switchback-to-brand rates were estimated using Kaplan-Meier methodology. Medical resource utilization and costs were compared among the three periods using multivariate regression analysis. Results: In total, 948 patients were observed during 1,105 person-years of brand use, 233person-years of single-generic use, and 92 person-years of multiple-generic use. A total of 23% of generic users received at least two different generic versions. Compared to brand use, multiple-generic use was associated with higher utilization of other prescription drugs (incidence rate ratio [IRR] = 1.27,95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.24-1.31), higher hospitalization rates (0.48 vs 0.83 visit/person-year, IRR = 1.65,95% CI = 1.28-2.13), and longer hospital stays (2.6 vs 3.9 days/person-year, IRR = 1.43, 95% CI = 1.27- 1.60), but the effect was less pronounced in single-generic use (hospitalization: IRR = 1.08, 95% CI = 0.88-1.34, length of stay: IRR = 1.12, 95% CI = 1.03-1.23). The risk of head injury or fracture was nearly three times higher (hazard ratio = 2.84, 95% CI = 1.24-6.48) following a generic-to-generic switch compared to brand use. The total annualized health care cost per patientwashigher in the multiplegeneric than brand periods by C$1,716 (cost ratio = 1.21, p = 0.0420). Conclusion: Multiple-generic substitution of topiramate was significantly associated with negative outcomes, such as hospitalizations and injuries, and increased health care costs.

The goal of this study was to define the disease mechanisms that lead to connective tissue lesions in ARCL2. In a new cohort of 17 patients, DNA sequencing of ATP6V0A2 detected either homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations. Considerable allelic and phenotypic heterogeneity was observed, with a missense mutation of a moderately conserved residue p.P87L leading to unusually mild disease. Abnormal N- and/or mucin type O-glycosylation was observed in all patients tested. Premature stop codon mutations led to decreased ATP6V0A2 mRNA levels by destabilizing the mutant mRNA via the nonsense-mediated decay pathway. Loss of ATP6V0A2 either by siRNA knockdown or in ARCL2 cells resulted in distended Golgi cisternae, accumulation of abnormal lysosomes and multivesicular bodies. Immunostaining of ARCL2 cells showed the accumulation of tropoelastin (TE) in the Golgi and in large, abnormal intracellular and extracellular aggregates. Pulse-chase studies confirmed impaired secretion and increased intracellular retention of TE, and insoluble elastin assays showed significantly reduced extracellular deposition of mature elastin. Fibrillin-1 microfibril assembly and secreted lysyl oxidase activity were normal in ARCL2 cells. TUNEL staining demonstrated increased rates of apoptosis in ARCL2 cell cultures. We conclude that loss-of-function mutations in ATP6V0A2 lead to TE aggregation in the Golgi, impaired clearance of TE aggregates and increased apoptosis of elastogenic cells.

Dok-4 Is a Novel Negative Regulator of T Cell Activation	JOURNAL OF IMMUNOLOGY			English	Article							PLECKSTRIN HOMOLOGY DOMAIN; PHOSPHOTYROSINE-BINDING DOMAINS; PROTEIN-TYROSINE KINASE; SIGNAL-TRANSDUCTION; IMMUNOLOGICAL SYNAPSE; MEMBRANE ASSOCIATION; NEURITE OUTGROWTH; ADAPTER PROTEINS; PH DOMAINS; TEC KINASE	Dok-4 (downstream of tyrosine kinase-4) is a recently identified member of the Dok family of adaptor proteins, which are characterized by an amino-terminal pleckstrin homology domain, a phosphotyrosine-binding domain, and a carboxyl-terminal region containing several tyrosines and poly-proline-rich motif's. Two members of the Dok family, Dok-1 and Dok-2, have already been described as negative regulators in T cells. However, the function of Dok-4, which is also expressed in T cells, remains unknown. In this study, we report that Dok-4 is phosphorylated after TCR engagement and shuttled within the cytoplasm of T cells before being recruited to the polarized microtubule organizing center after the formation of the immunological synapse. Loss-of-function experiments using RNA interference constructs show that Dok-4 is a negative regulator of ERK phosphorylation, IL-2 promoter activity, and T cell proliferation. Exogenous expression of wild-type Dok-4 induces a significant activation of Rap1, which is involved in the regulation of ERK. The pleckstrin homology domain of Dok-4 is required both for its cytoplasmic shuttling and relocalization as well as for its inhibitory properties on T cell activation. Thus, Dok-4 represents a novel negative regulator of T cells. The Journal of Immunology, 2009, 182: 7681-7689.

To understand how CaN contributes to neuronal circuit development, whole-cell mEPSC recordings and multiphoton imaging were performed in the visual system of living Xenopus laevis tadpoles electroporated to express either a CaN phosphatase inhibitor or N-VIVIT, a nuclear localization sequence-tagged VIVIT peptide that blocks the binding of CaN to select substrates including NFAT. Both strategies increased mEPSC frequency and dendritic arbor complexity in tectal neurons over 3 days. Expression of either of two constitutively active Xenopus NFATs (CA-NFATs) restored normal synaptic properties in neurons expressing N-VIVIT. However, the morphological phenotype was only rescued by a CA-NFAT bearing an intact regulatory domain, implying that transcriptional control of morphological and electrophysiological properties of neurons is mediated by distinct NFAT interactions.

J	Moore, FGA; Chalk, C				Moore, Fraser G. A.; Chalk, Colin			The essential neurologic examination What should medical students be taught?	NEUROLOGY			English	Article							DELPHI	Background: Graduating medical students often identify the neurologic examination (NE) as one of the clinical skills with which they are least comfortable. We hypothesized that this is because they are unsure about which elements of the NE are important, and conducted a study 1) to identify whether neurologists agree about the essential elements of the NE and 2) to determine whether the views of medical students about what is essential differ from those of neurologists. Methods: Using a Delphi process, we asked McGill University neurologists which elements of the NE they would perform at least 80% of the time in a common clinical scenario. We confirmed the results in a sample of Canadian neurologists, and then compared the results of the McGill neurologists to a sample of graduating McGill University medical students. Results: The neurologists surveyed rated 22 items of the NE as essential, and there was a high degree of consensus about which items were essential. Medical student ratings of the importance of NE items were largely similar to those of the neurologists, although there were some noteworthy discrepancies. Conclusions: The anxiety felt by medical students regarding the neurologic examination (NE) seems unlikely to be solely due to uncertainty about which elements of the NE are important. Expert consensus about the essential elements of the NE and awareness of areas where neurologist and student views differ should be used to guide teaching of the NE.

J	Choi, WY; Guitton, D				Choi, Woo Young; Guitton, Daniel			Firing Patterns in Superior Colliculus of Head-Unrestrained Monkey during Normal and Perturbed Gaze Saccades Reveal Short-Latency Feedback and a Sluggish Rostral Shift in Activity	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							EYE-MOVEMENTS; VESTIBULOOCULAR REFLEX; TECTORETICULAR NEURONS; INTERRUPTED SACCADES; OMNIPAUSE NEURON; FIXATION NEURONS; PRIMATE; STIMULATION; BURST; CAT	The superior colliculus (SC) encodes a saccade via the spatial position of an ensemble of active neurons on its motor map. Downstream circuits control muscles with the temporal code of firing frequency and duration. The moving hill hypothesis resolves the SC-to-brainstem spatiotemporal transformation (STT) enigma by proposing feedback to the SC which "pushes" a hill of activity ( height = frequency) caudorostrally such that its instantaneous position encodes the angular error [gaze-position error (GPE)] between gaze and target. This mechanism, proposed for cat but controversial in primate, has not been tested in the head-unrestrained monkey. We do this here. During large similar to 60 degrees control gaze shifts in the dark, a hill of activity began in the caudal SC and moved rostrally, but too sluggishly to encode veridical GPE. At gaze end the peak had not reached the rostral pole and only arrived there similar to 80 ms later. No moving hill accompanied similar to 20 degrees gaze shifts, in agreement with previous studies of head-fixed monkeys. To investigate feedback to the SC, we perturbed large gaze shifts producing initial and corrective gaze saccades separated by 50-800 ms of gaze immobility, the gaze plateau. Map activity was dramatically remodeled: the sluggishly moving hill stopped during the plateau, at the site encoding the corrective gaze saccade, thereby providing a tonic stationary spatially encoded memory signal of plateau GPE. A burst occurred before the corrective saccade. Conclusion: Feedback to map moves activity which encodes a low-pass filtered GPE signal, a process too slow to implement the STT but adequate for corrective gaze saccades.

Remyelination capacity of the MS brain decreases with disease chronicity	NEUROLOGY			English	Article							CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; PROGRESSIVE MULTIPLE-SCLEROSIS; OLIGODENDROCYTE PROGENITORS; CNS REMYELINATION; SPINAL-CORD; OLD RATS; DEMYELINATION; LESIONS; CELLS; DIFFERENTIATION	Objective: To analyze and compare the extent of remyelination in lesions from patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) who have a short (early MS lesions) or a long (chronic MS lesions) disease duration and to determine the influence of anatomic localization on the extent of remyelination. In early MS lesions, remyelination has been described as a relatively frequent event, in contrast to chronic MS lesions, where remyelination is absent or limited to the lesion border in the majority of lesions. However, no studies have been published that have quantified and compared the extent of remyelination in early and chronic MS lesions. Methods: We analyzed the occurrence of remyelination in 52 biopsies from 51 patients (early MS) and in 174 lesions from 36 autopsy cases (chronic MS) by immunohistochemistry for myelin proteins, and correlated our findings with anatomic localization, sex, age, and disease duration. Results: Significantly more lesions were remyelinated in early than in chronicMS (80.7% vs 60%). In chronic MS, subcortical lesions showed more extensive remyelination than periventricular lesions. The majority of cerebellar lesions were completely demyelinated. Conclusion: In summary, our data demonstrate that remyelination is a frequent event in early multiple sclerosis lesions. Furthermore, the anatomic localization of a lesion might influence the extent of remyelination.

These alterations may influence the processes of ethanol reward and reinforcement. Thus, it was the objective of this study to investigate the response of the 3 major opioid peptide systems (endorphins, enkephalins, and dynorphins) to acute ethanol administration, at the level of the midbrain including the ventral tegmental area (midbrain/VTA), a region important for drug, including ethanol reinforcement. Using the in vivo microdialysis technique coupled with specific solid-phase radioimmunoassay for beta-endorphin, met-enkephalin, and dynorphin A(1-8,) changes in the extracellular concentration of theses peptides at the level of midbrain/VTA were determined at distinct time points following the administration of 0.0 (saline), 0.8, 1.2, 1.6, 2.0, and 2.4 g ethanol/kg B.Wt. A biphasic effect of ethanol on beta-endorphin release was found, with low to medium (1.2, 1.6, and 2.0 g) but not high (2.4 g) doses of ethanol, inducing a significant increase in the dialysate content of beta-endorphin. A late increase in the dialysate content of dynorphin A(1-8) was observed in response to the 1.2 g ethanol dose. However, none of the ethanol doses tested significantly altered the content of met-enkephalin in the dialysate. The present findings suggest that the ethanol-induced increase of beta-endorphin release at the level of midbrain/VTA may influence alcohol reinforcement.

We identified de novo mutations in STXBP1 (nonsense, p.R388X; splicing, c.169+1G>A) in two patients with severe mental retardation and nonsyndromic epilepsy. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and sequencing showed that the splicing mutation creates a stop codon downstream of exon-3. No de novo or deleterious Mutations in STXBP1 were found in 190 control subjects, or in 142 autistic patients. These results suggest that STXBP1 disruption is associated with autosomal dominant mental retardation and nonsyndromic epilepsy.

The purpose of this preliminary study was to explore the use of the Perceive, Recall, Plan and Perform (PRPP) System of Task Analysis for this clientele. The specific objectives were to describe information processing difficulties as measured by the PRPP and to examine preliminary evidence of construct validity and interrater reliability. In the first part of this study, 10 participants with schizophrenia living in the community were assessed using the PRPP during both a simple and a complex meal preparation task. Community functioning was measured using the Independent Living Skills Survey. In the second part, interrater reliability was appraised using three trained raters, who scored 15 participants preparing the complex meal preparation task. Analysis of performance demonstrates that people with schizophrenia have difficulties especially in the Perceive and Plan quadrants of the PRPP and are more challenged in the complex task. The PRPP total score for the complex task is strongly related to the community functioning score. Results indicate good interrater reliability for the PRPP total score and moderate interrater reliability for the quadrant scores. Despite the small sample size, results from this preliminary study support the use of the PRPP System of Task Analysis to further explore the impact cognitive deficits have on daily task performance and thus on community functioning in people with schizophrenia.

In this study we investigated the effects of MTHFR and dietary folate deficiency at 10.5 days post coitum (dpc) in our mouse model of mild MTHFR deficiency. METHODS: Mthfr +/+ and +/- female mice were fed a control or folic acid-deficient diet for 6 weeks, then mated with Mthfr +/- males. At 10.5 dpc, embryos were examined and placentae were collected for histologic evaluation. RESULTS: Maternal MTHFR and folate deficiencies resulted in increased developmental delays and smaller embryos. We also observed a low frequency of a variety of embryonic defects in the experimental groups, such as neural tube, heart looping, and turning defects; these results mimic the low incidence and multifactorial nature of these anomalies in humans. Folate-deficient mice also had increased embryonic losses and severe placental defects, including placental abruption and disturbed patterning of placental layers. Folate-deficient placentae had decreased ApoA-I expression, and there was a trend toward a negative correlation between ApoA-I expression with maternal homocysteine concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides biological evidence linking maternal MTHFR and dietary folate deficiencies to adverse pregnancy outcomes in mice. It underscores the importance of folate not only in reducing the incidence of early embryonic defects, but also in the prevention of developmental delays and placental abnormalities that may increase susceptibility to other defects and to reproductive	[Pickell, Laura; Li, Deqiang; Brown, Katharine; Mikael, Leonie G.; Wang, Xiao-Ling; Wu, Qing; Luo, Li; Jerome-Majewska, Loydie; Rozen, Rima] McGill Montreal Childrens Hosp Rescarch Inst, Montreal, PQ H3Z 2Z3, Canada; [Pickell, Laura; Li, Deqiang; Mikael, Leonie G.; Wang, Xiao-Ling; Wu, Qing; Luo, Li; Jerome-Majewska, Loydie; Rozen, Rima] McGill Univ, Dept Human Genet, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Li, Deqiang; Mikael, Leonie G.; Wang, Xiao-Ling; Wu, Qing; Luo, Li; Jerome-Majewska, Loydie; Rozen, Rima] McGill Univ, Dept Pediat, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Brown, Katharine; Rozen, Rima] McGill Univ, Dept Biol, Montreal, PQ, Canada	Rozen, R (reprint author), McGill Montreal Childrens Hosp Rescarch Inst, 4060 Ste Catherine St W,Room 242, Montreal, PQ H3Z 2Z3, Canada.	rima.rozen@mcgill.ca						58	35	36	0	4	WILEY-BLACKWELL	HOBOKEN	111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA	1542-0752	1542-0760		BIRTH DEFECTS RES A	Birth Defects Res.

Such studies have demonstrated functional relationships between the brain and behaviour as well as how the brain and behaviour evolve in concert with one another. Here, the authors illustrate with their data on tool use and cerebellar morphology in birds that such comparisons can be further extended to (a) relate the morphology of a brain region to a behaviour, and (b) provide insight into the function of an often overlooked brain region in comparative cognitive studies, the cerebellum. Their results indicate that tool-using species have a significantly more folded cerebellar cortex, but not a larger cerebellum than non-tool-using species. This marks the first demonstration of an empirical relationship between the folding of a neural structure and a cognitive behaviour and in so doing, provides critical insight into the neural basis of tool use and the role of the cerebellum in cognitive processes.

To establish culturally adapted antidiabetic treatments, our team identified several candidate plant species used by the Cree to treat symptoms of diabetes. An initial study focused on 8 species and revealed that most possess significant in vitro antidiabetic activity. The purpose of the present study was to assess a further 9 species identified through the ethnobotanical survey. Crude plant extracts were screened for (i) potentiation of basal and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake by skeletal muscle cells (C2C12) and adipocytes (3T3-L1); (ii) potentiation of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion by pancreatic beta cells (beta TC); (iii) potentiation of adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 cells; (iv) protection against glucose toxicity and glucose deprivation in PC12-AC neuronal precursor cells; and (v) diphenylpicrylhydrazyl (DPPH) oxygen free radical scavenging. Four species potentiated basal glucose uptake in muscle cells or adipocytes, one species being as potent as metformin. Adipogenesis was accelerated by 4 species with a potency roughly half that of rosiglitazone. Five species protected PC12-AC cells against glucose toxicity and 4 protected against glucose deprivation. Five species exhibited antioxidant activity comparable to ascorbic acid. However, no species increased insulin secretion. The present study revealed that Gaultheria hispidula, Rhododendron tomentosum, and Vaccinium vitis-idaea exhibit a promising profile of antidiabetic potential and are good candidates for more in-depth evaluation.

Methods: The method uses the Gabor Transform and detects changes of power in comparison to background activity using t-statistics that are controlled by the false discovery rate (FDR) to correct type I error of multiple testing. The analysis was applied to EEGs recorded at 2000 Hz from three patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. Results: Spike-related increase of high-frequency oscillations (HFOs) was clearly shown in the FDR-controlled t-spectra: it was most dramatic in spikes recorded from the hippocampus when the hippocampus was the seizure onset zone (SOZ). Depression of fast activity was observed immediately after the spikes, especially consistently in the discharges from the hippocampal SOZ. It corresponded to the slow wave part in case of spike-and-slow-wave complexes, but it was noted even in spikes without apparent slow waves. In one patient, a gradual increase of power above 200 Hz preceded spikes. Conclusions: FDR-controlled t-spectra clearly detected the spike-related changes of HFOs that were unclear in standard power spectra. Significance: We developed a promising tool to study the HFOs that may be closely linked to the pathophysiology of epileptogenesis. (C) 2009 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

Background: Semantic memory is often impaired in neurodegenerative disease. Neuropsychologic and functional neuroimaging studies suggest that the semantic processing of verbal and nonverbal stimuli may depend oil partially distinct brain networks. Methods: We examined this possibility using voxel-based morphometry to correlate performance on verbal and nonverbal versions of a semantic association task with regional gray matter atrophy in 144 individuals with a variety of neurodegenerative diseases. Results: Results showed that, regardless of stimulus type, semantic processing correlated with atrophy in both temporal lobes. In addition, material-specific correlations were found in left temporal regions for verbal stimuli and the right fusiform gyrus for nonverbal stimuli. Conclusions: These results provide evidence for a differential role of the left and right hemispheres in the extraction of semantic information from verbal and pictorial representations. Areas in right inferior temporal lobe may be necessary to access structural descriptions of visually presented objects.

Prediction of street tree morphological parameters using artificial neural networks	COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE			English	Article						LIDAR laser; Multilayer perceptron; Street tree inventory; Tree morphological parameters prediction; Urban ecological conditions	YIELD PREDICTION; GENETIC ALGORITHM; CLASSIFICATION; PERFORMANCE; VEGETATION; QUALITY; MODEL	Street trees positively affect the everyday life of city inhabitants and therefore successful management of this resource is important. A tree inventory is an essential first step towards this end, but this activity can be complex, costly and must be optimized. In order to reduce time and effort required for data acquisition either when using traditional field work or airborne laser systems, a method is proposed to predict the value of essential tree morphological parameters with surrogate variables and artificial intelligence multilayer perceptron networks (MLPs). To evaluate MLPs, seven different models were tested on Acer platanoides L, Acer saccharinum L., Celtis occidentalis L., Fraxinus pennsylvanica Marsh., Gleditsia triacanthos L., Tilia cordata Mill., and Ulmus pumila L data sets. Three models were intended to predict diameter at breast height (DBH), annual DBH increment and crown volume with a minimal number of input measurements to be extracted from aerial LIDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) data. The last four were associated with traditional ground inventory methods and aimed to predict height, crown volume and their respective annual increments using less labour-intensive variables. The prediction performance was assessed with the Pearson r correlation coefficient, computed between the measured and estimated output values for each of the cross-validation test files per tree species and model. By using carefully selected biotic and abiotic input parameters, the prediction performance of multilayer perceptron showed robustness and precision despite different age-class distribution per species, dissimilar species morphological characteristics, uneven distribution of species within defined urban ecological zones, and varied abiotic growth conditions. More precisely, prediction coefficients were greater than 70% for all models with very small probability levels except for two predictions were input data exhibited strongly non-Gaussian distributions. Overall, the average prediction for all scenarios was 91%. Considering these results, it was found that prediction of DBH, annual DBH increment and crown volume is possible with limited aerial LIDAR laser information. Moreover, it was established that traditional field work effort can be further reduced by predicting the value of unmeasured morphological parameters within acceptable levels of precision. These findings can have an impact on future urban tree inventories. Depending on the number of trees to be measured, municipal administrations have the choice to use either airborne or traditional data acquisition methods. In both cases, this research proposes optimized procedures that may reduce the overall inventory costs. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Because of its properties such as cationic charges, biocompatibility, biodegradability, and low toxicity, it has been used as a potential gene, siRNA, protein (including antibodies), and drug carrier system. Method: This work describes the development of chitosan nanoparticles of a 20-nm diameter for a potential siRNA delivery application. The particles were prepared using an ionic gelation method, using sodium tripolyphosphate as a cross-linker. The effect of variation in pH was investigated on particle size and surface charge. Gene loading efficiency by chitosan nanoparticles was performed by varying weight ratios of chitosan:siRNA. Transfection efficiency was evaluated on Neuro2a cells. Results: It was observed that 20-nm-sized nanoscale complexes induced significant transfection in neuronal cells. Conclusion: These particles have potential in the delivery of siRNA to neural tissues.

We have previously demonstrated that, in the caudal DRN of rat, some serotonin neurons are endowed with NK1rs that are mostly cytoplasmic, whereas these receptors are mostly membrane bound in non-serotonin neurons. Here, we first examined by double-labeling immunocytochemistry the relationships between SP axon terminals and these two categories of DRN neurons. Almost half of the SP terminals were synaptic and many were in close contact with serotonin dendrites, but never with non-serotonin dendrites. In additional double-immunolabeling experiments, most if not all dendrites bearing membranous NK1rs appeared to be GABAergic. Treatment with the selective neurokinin-1 antagonist RP67580 modified the subcellular distribution of NK1rs in serotonin neurons. At 1 h after administration of a single dose, the receptor distribution was unchanged in both dendritic types but, after daily administration for 7 or 21 days, the plasma membrane and cytoplasmic density of NK1rs were increased in serotonin dendrites, without any change in non-serotonin dendrites. These treatments also increased NK1r gene expression in the caudal DRN. Lastly, a marked increase in the membrane (but not cytoplasmic) density of NK1rs was measured in serotonin dendrites after bilateral habenular lesion. These results suggest that the trafficking of NK1rs represents a cellular mechanism in control of the modulation of serotonin neuron activity by SP in DRN.

Drugs that restore DA homeostasis are most likely to constitute effective treatments for such emotional disturbances. In this study, we investigated the effects of several doses of OSU-6162, a drug that belongs to a new class named "DA stabilizers", on brain stimulation reward. Because quinpirole produces, depending on the dose, a pre-synaptic depressant and a post-synaptic stimulatory effect on reward and locomotor activity, we also compared the ability of OSU-6162 and haloperidol to prevent these effects of the full DA agonist. Results show that OSU-6162 produced a dose-orderly reduction of reward with no change in the capacity of the animals to produce the operant response, and prevented, like haloperidol, both stimulatory and depressant effects of quinpirole on locomotor activity but only its reward stimulatory effect. The observed functional antagonism of OSU-6162 on these DA-dependent behaviors suggests that it may constitute an effective treatment for abnormal positive emotional state, and that it would be exempt of motor side-effects.

J	Cervero, F				Cervero, Fernando			Spinal cord hyperexcitability and its role in pain and hyperalgesia	EXPERIMENTAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Review						Sensitization; Hyperalgesia; Spinal cord; Wind-up; Chronic pain	SUBSTANCE-P; CUTANEOUS HYPERALGESIA; RECEPTOR ANTAGONISTS; VISCERAL PAIN; DORSAL-HORN; BRAIN-STEM; NEURONS; MECHANISMS; MICE; RAT	Sensitization of spinal cord nociceptive neurons is commonly interpreted as the cause for the hypersensitivity that characterizes chronic pain states in humans. However, in spite of much basic research in this area it has not been possible to demonstrate a direct link between the hyperexcitability of spinal cord neurons observed experimentally and the underlying mechanism of a chronic pain state. The word sensitization is also used in the literature with various and different meanings from the qualification of a cellular process of enhanced excitability at synaptic level to the characteristics of a chronic pain syndrome. In this article the various meanings of sensitization are described and the relevance of the hyperexcitability of spinal cord neurons to the generation of clinically relevant pain states is discussed. A proposal is made to restrict the use of the word sensitization to the cellular process of enhanced excitability observed experimentally after repetitive stimulation of nociceptive afferents. Caution is also recommended when associating neuronal sensitization in the spinal cord with the mechanisms of chronic pain conditions.

Sanfilippo Syndrome Type C: Mutation Spectrum in the Heparan Sulfate Acetyl-CoA: alpha-Glucosaminide N-Acetyltransferase (HGSNAT) Gene	HUMAN MUTATION			English	Article						MPS IIIC; Sanfilippo syndrome type C; HGSNAT; N-acetyltransferase; lysosome; heparan sulfate; mucopolysaccharidosis; mutation analysis	LYSOSOMAL STORAGE DISEASES; COENZYME-A; MUCOPOLYSACCHARIDOSIS-III; TRANSMEMBRANE ACETYLATION; SKIN FIBROBLASTS; DISORDERS; PROTEIN; LOCALIZATION; NETHERLANDS; PREVALENCE	Mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) type IIIC or Sanfilippo syndrome type C is a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by the deficiency of the lysosomal membrane enzyme, heparan sulfate acetyl-CoA (AcCoA): alpha-glucosaminide N,acetyltransferase (HGSNAT; EC 2.3.1.78), which catalyzes transmembrane acetylation. of the terminal glucosamine residues of heparan sulfate prior to their hydrolysis by alpha-N-acetylglucosaminidase. Lysosomal storage of undegraded heparan sulfate in the cells of affected patients leads to neuronal death, causing neurodegeneration and severely impaired development accompanied by mild visceral and skeletal abnormalities, including mild dwarfism, coarse facies, and joint stiffness. To date, 50 HGSNAT mutations have been identified in MPS IIIC patients: 40 were previously published and 10 novel mutations are reported here. The mutations span the entire structure of the gene and include 13 splice-site mutations, I I insertions and deletions, 8 nonsense mutations, and 18 missense mutations (http://chromium.liacs.nl/LOVD2/home.php? select_db = HGSNAT). In addition, four polymorphisms result in amino acid changes that do not affect activity of the enzyme. In this work we discuss the spectrum of MPS MC mutations, their clinical presentation and distribution within the patient population, and speculate how the mutations may affect the structure and function of HGSNAT.

The design features a mixed-signal integrated circuit (IC) that handles conditioning, digitization, and time-division multiplexing of neural signals, and a digital IC that provides control, bandwidth reduction, and data communications for telemetry toward a remote host. Bandwidth reduction is achieved through action potential detection and complete capture of waveforms by means of onchip data buffering. The adopted architecture uses high parallelism and low-power building blocks for safety and long-term implantability. Both ICs are fabricated in a CMOS 0.18-mu m process and are subsequently mounted on the base of the microelectrode array. The chips are stacked according to a vertical integration approach for better compactness. The presented device integrates 16 channels, and is scalable to hundreds of recording channels. Its performance was validated on a testbench with synthetic neural signals. The proposed interface presents a power consumption of 138 mu W per channel, a size of 2.30 mm(2) and achieves a bandwidth reduction factor of up to 48 with typical recordings.

However, the pairing of wind with energy storage systems could be utilized in order to produce dispatchable power. This paper considers a two-level energy storage system for application to wind energy systems. A knowledge-based management algorithm is proposed in order to schedule the power from the two levels. The system is tested for two possible power systems applications and its performance is compared with that of an alternate scheduling approach. Results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm requires a lower storage rating due to its ability to better coordinate operation of the two devices.

Although the view of appetite as an addiction to food is controversial, there are useful lessons to be learned from the neuroscience of addiction for understanding obesity. The speakers in this symposium all addressed different aspects of the neurobiology of feeding and obesity. In this overview and the associated reviews, the behavioral, genetic and neural factors that promote over-eating in animals and humans are discussed.

Two elements are believed to be important in constructing an ensemble: (a) the performance of each individual classifier; and (b) diversity among the classifiers. Nevertheless, most works based on diversity suggest that there exists only weak correlation between classifier performance and ensemble accuracy. We propose compound diversity functions which combine the diversities with the performance of each individual classifier, and show that there is a strong correlation between the proposed functions and ensemble accuracy. Calculation of the correlations with different ensemble creation methods, different problems and different classification algorithms on 0.624 million ensembles suggests that most compound diversity functions are better than traditional diversity measures. The population-based Genetic Algorithm was used to search for the best ensembles on a handwritten numerals recognition problem and to evaluate 42.24 million ensembles. The statistical results indicate that compound diversity functions perform better than traditional diversity measures, and are helpful in selecting the best ensembles.

However, we do not know if behavioral symptoms associate with neurocognitive processes in very young children as they do in older children. We studied a population-based birth cohort of children (N = 1,950) whose developmental trajectories of physical aggression and hyperactivity were assessed between the ages of 17 and 41 months. We measured the following neurocognitive abilities at 41 months of age: Receptive vocabulary, visuospatial organization, and short-term memory. After controlling for other neurocognitive abilities, frequent physical aggression was related specifically to receptive vocabulary deficits (p < .0001) while frequent hyperactivity was related specifically to deficits of visuospatial organization (p < .0001). The pattern of associations was robust despite controls for socioeconomic and perinatal status. The different neurocognitive correlates of physical aggression and hyperactivity problems observed during adolescence are apparent in early childhood. Whereas physical aggression problems are associated with language deficits, hyperactivity problems are related to non-verbal deficits.

We study here a case where we know that the function to be learned is non-decreasing in its two arguments and convex in one of them. For this purpose we propose a class of functions similar to multi-layer neural networks but (1) that has those properties, (2) is a universal approximator of Lipschitz(1) functions with these and other properties. We apply this new class of functions to the task of modelling the price of call options. Experiments show improvements on regressing the price of call options using the new types of function classes that incorporate the a priori constraints.

Here, we examined how different methods of MPTP administration influence the degeneration of the dopaminergic (DA) system. Adult male C57BL/6 mice were treated with the same cumulative dose of MPTP following four distinct procedures: (i) subacute i.p. injections; (ii) 28-day chronic s.c. infusion; (iii) 28-day chronic i.p. infusion; and (iv) 14-day chronic i.p. infusion. Subacute MPTP treatment significantly affected all aspects of the DA system within the nigral and striatal territories. In contrast, the 28-day chronic s.c. infusion did not significantly alter any components of the DA system. The 28- and 14-day chronic i.p. infusions induced loss of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive cells correlated with a decrease in Nurr1 mRNA levels, but no significant decrease in the density of TH striatal fibers. Importantly, however, only the 14-day chronic MPTP i.p. infusion protocol promoted the formation of neuronal inclusions as noted by the expression of alpha-synuclein protein within the cytoplasm of TH nigral neurons. Overall, we found that the 14-day chronic MPTP i.p. infusion reproduces more accurately the pathological characteristics of early stage Parkinson's disease.

Mitochondrial and Axonal Abnormalities Precede Disruption of the Neurofilament Network in a Model of Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease Type 2E and Are Prevented by Heat Shock Proteins in a Mutant-Specific Fashion	JOURNAL OF NEUROPATHOLOGY AND EXPERIMENTAL NEUROLOGY			English	Article						Charcot-Marie-tooth-disease; Heat shock proteins; Mitochondria; Neurofilament	CU/ZN-SUPEROXIDE-DISMUTASE; ALPHA-B-CRYSTALLIN; AMYOTROPHIC-LATERAL-SCLEROSIS; MOTOR-NEURON DISEASE; INTERMEDIATE-FILAMENTS; LIGHT GENE; AGGREGATE FORMATION; LINKED MUTATIONS; CULTURE MODEL; PHOSPHORYLATION	Mutations in NEFL encoding the light neurofilament subunit (NFL) cause Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2E (CMT2E), which affects both motor and sensory neurons. We expressed the disease-Causing mutants NFL(P8R) and NFL(Q333P) in motor neurons of dissociated spinal cord-dorsal root ganglia and demonstrated that they are incorporated into the preexisting neurofilament network but eventually disrupt neurofilaments without causing significant motor neuron death. Importantly, rounding of mitochondria and reduction in axonal diameter occurred before disruption of the neurofilament network, indicating that mitochondrial dysfunction contributes to the pathogenesis of CMT2E, as well as to CMT caused by mitofusin mutations. Heat shock proteins (HSPs) are involved in the formation of the neurofilament network and in protecting cells from misfolded mutant proteins. Cotransfection of HSPB1 with mutated NEFL maintained the neurofilament network, axonal diameter, and mitochondrial length in motor neurons expressing NFL(P8R), but not NFL(Q333P). Conversely, HSPA1 cotransfection was effective in motor neurons expressing NFL(Q333P), but not NFL(P8R). Thus, there are NFL mutant-specific differences in the ability of individual HSPs to prevent neurofilament abnormalities, reduction in axonal caliber, and disruption of mitochondrial morphology in motor neurons. These results suggest that FISP inducers have therapeutic potential for CMT2E but that their efficacy would depend on the profile of HSPs induced and the type of NEFL mutation.

Effects of Human Arm Impedance on Dynamics Learning and Generalization	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article							UNSTABLE DYNAMICS; STATIC CONDITIONS; HAND IMPEDANCE; MOVEMENT; ADAPTATION; MULTIJOINT; STIFFNESS; POSTURE; TASKS; MODEL	Darainy M, Mattar AAG, Ostry DJ. Effects of human arm impedance on dynamics learning and generalization. J Neurophysiol 101: 3158-3168, 2009. First published April 8, 2009; doi:10.1152/jn.91336.2008. Previous studies have demonstrated anisotropic patterns of hand impedance under static conditions and during movement. Here we show that the pattern of kinematic error observed in studies of dynamics learning is associated with this anisotropic impedance pattern. We also show that the magnitude of kinematic error associated with this anisotropy dictates the amount of motor learning and, consequently, the extent to which dynamics learning generalizes. Subjects were trained to reach to visual targets while holding a robotic device that applied forces during movement. On infrequent trials, the load was removed and the resulting kinematic error was measured. We found a strong correlation between the pattern of kinematic error and the anisotropic pattern of hand stiffness. In a second experiment subjects were trained under force-field conditions to move in two directions: one in which the dynamic perturbation was in the direction of maximum arm impedance and the associated kinematic error was low and another in which the perturbation was in the direction of low impedance where kinematic error was high. Generalization of learning was assessed in a reference direction that lay intermediate to the two training directions. We found that transfer of learning was greater when training occurred in the direction associated with the larger kinematic error. This suggests that the anisotropic patterns of impedance and kinematic error determine the magnitude of dynamics learning and the extent to which it generalizes.	[Darainy, Mohammad; Mattar, Andrew A.

Loss of insight is associated with early behavioral variant FTD, but not PPA. This study used the Frontal Behavioral Inventory to compare patient and caregiver concepts of symptom presence and severity. Patients with behavioral variant FTD were found to have worse insight overall than PPA patients. However, the PPA group showed reduced insight into behavioral symptoms, and the behavioral variant FTD groups had intact insight into some language symptoms. Theoretical and clinical implications are discussed.

The cellular mechanisms driving p75(NTR) expression in cell lines and primary neurons is Sp1 dependent (Ramos et al. [2007] J. Neurosci. 27:1498). In this study, we analyzed the spatiotemporal profile of p75(NTR) expression after an ischemic lesion induced by cortical devascularization (CD). Our results show that p75(NTR) expression occurs in isolated neurons of the ischemic lesion site. The p75(NTR+) neurons presented morphological alterations and active caspase-3 staining. Some p75(NTR+) neurons were also positive for sortilin. The peak of p75(NTR) expression was localized 3 days postlesion (3DPL) in the penumbra. Sp1 transcription factor nuclear localization was observed in p75(NTR+) neurons. The overall level of Sp1 expression was increased until 14DPL on the ipsilateral hemisphere. With primary cortical neurons, we demonstrated that p75(NTR) expression is induced by excitotoxic stress and correlated with increased Sp1 abundance. We conclude that p75(NTR) expression is localized in selected neurons of the ischemic lesion and that these neurons are probably condemned to apoptotic cell death. In primary neuronal culture, it is clear that excitotoxity and Sp1 are involved in induction of p75(NTR) expression, although, in vivo, some additional mechanisms are likely to be involved in the control of p75(NTR) expression in specific neurons in Vivo.

In this paper the authors aimed to provide information related to major and minor surgical and neurological complications encountered following stereoelectroencephalography and epilepsy surgery. Methods. The authors performed a retrospective review of 491 and 1905 patients who underwent intracranial electrode implantation and epilepsy Surgery, respectively, between 1976 and 2006 at the Montreal Neurological Institute. All intracranial electrode implantations and Surgical procedures were performed by I surgeon (A.O.). Results. A total of 6415 electrode implantations and 2449 Surgical procedures were done. There were no deaths related to either procedure. There were no major complications after intracranial electrode implantation, and the risks of infection and intracranial hematoma were found to be 1.8 and 0.8%, respectively. The number of electrodes per lobe (p = 0.05) and number of lobes covered (p = 0.04) were significant risk factors for hematoma and infection. Regarding epilepsy surgery, there were no major surgical complications, and the overall minor complication rate was 2.9%. Infection was the most common complication (1.0%), followed by intracranial hematoma (0.7%). Significant risk factors associated with hematomas and infections were the number of reoperations (p = 0.001) and older patient ace (p = 0.03). Minor and major neurological complication rates were 2.7 and 0.5%, respectively, and the rate of overall neurological morbidity was 3.3%. Hemiparesis was the most frequent neurological complication (1.5%). Conclusions. Based on the authors' experience, intracranial electrode implantation is an effective method with an extremely low morbidity rate. Moreover, epilepsy surgery is safe, especially in experienced hands.

The insular region has long been neglected in the investigation and treatment of refractory epilepsy. Surgery in the insular region is rarely performed because of the risk of injury to the opercula, the arteries transiting on the surface of the insula, and the deep structures such as the basal ganglia and the internal capsule. This study was undertaken to report the results of insular surgery using modern microsurgical techniques in patients with epilepsy. Methods. The authors performed a retrospective Study of cases involving patients who underwent Surgery for insular lesions associated with epilepsy over the last 10 years. In the majority of patients, intracranial electrodes were implanted with neuronavigation guidance to confirm the localization of the epileptic foci. Results. Nine patients underwent insular surgery: 7 for refractory epilepsy with no tumor and 2 for tumors associated with seizures. Four of the resections were performed in the left hemisphere. After an average follow-up of 54 months (range 14-122 months), Engel Class IA outcome had been achieved in 6 of 7 cases in the Epilepsy Surgery Group. The remaining patient had an Engel Class III Outcome after partial insular resection but later became seizure-free (Engel Class IA) following insular Gamma Knife Surgery. Postoperatively, the majority of patients Suffered from minor reversible hemipareses that disappeared completely within a few months. There was no surgical mortality. Conclusions. Insular Surgery is both safe and beneficial when it is well planned and performed with modern microsurgical techniques and good anatomical knowledge. Insulectomy is associated with little permanent morbidity and a high rate of seizure control. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first series of insulectomies predominantly performed for refractory epilepsy since those performed by Penfield. (DOI: 10.3171/2009.1.JNS08807).

VPE constructions are built from two simple clauses; the first is the antecedent clause and the second is the ellipsis clause. The ellipsis clause is missing its verb and object (i.e., its verb phrase (VP)), which receives its reference from the fully specified VP in the antecedent clause. VPE constructions are unlike other sentence types that require displacement of an argument NP; these latter constructions (e.g., object-relatives, wh-questions) yield either on-time or delayed antecedent reactivation. Our results demonstrate that Anomics, like unimpaired individuals, evince reactivation of the direct object NP (within the VP) at the elided position. Broca's patients, on the other hand, do not show reactivation of the antecedent. We consider several interpretations for our data, including explanations focusing on the larger 'grain size' of the reconstructed material in the ellipsis clause, the properties of the auxiliary that carries tense and agreement features, and the possibility that the cost-free syntactic copy procedure claimed to underlie VPE may be modulated by the functional deficit in Broca's aphasia.

This study aimed to identify neurochemical and neuroanatomical systems involved in sexual excitation and inhibition, their role during normal, and hypoactive sexual expressions. A comprehensive review of the human and animal literature is made, and a theory surrounding the ways that HSDD can be manifested and treated is presented. Drug effects and neural systems derived largely from rat studies that are involved in the stimulation of sexual desire (excitatory system) vs. the stimulation of sexual reward, sedation, and satiety (inhibitory system). Brain dopamine systems (incertohypothalamic and mesolimbic) that link the hypothalamus and limbic system appear to form the core of the excitatory system. This system also includes melanocortins, oxytocin, and norepinephrine. Brain opioid, endocannabinoid, and serotonin systems are activated during periods of sexual inhibition, and blunt the ability of excitatory systems to be activated. Drugs that stimulate the activation of hypothalamic dopamine or that blunt endocannabinoid or serotonin release and/or postsynaptic binding may be effective in stimulating sexual desire in animals and humans. The characterization of how those drugs work will help generate a rational approach to drug development in the treatment of HSDD. Pfaus JG. Pathways of sexual desire. J Sex Med 2009;6:1506-1533.

The disease also affects peripheral tissue such as peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Delineating biochemical alterations in AD blood constituents may possibly allow the identification of accessible footprints that reflect degenerative processes within the central nervous system. Here, we describe an integrated methodology for the generation of a blood-based molecular bio-repository, including the collection of clinical and demographic data for downstream stringent sample selection and stratification for the Study of molecular Signatures in AD. We report the simultaneous extraction of high quality and yield of DNA, RNA, and protein from PBMCs of individuals with sporadic AD. mild cognitive impairment. and normal elderly controls. We describe experimental designs and present examples for the discovery of underlying etiopathogenetic networks in sporadic AD. We suggest that PBMC-associated biomarkers may provide insights into the pathogenesis of AD and be used to monitor disease diagnosis and progression.

Through their inhibition of chylomicron secretion, mutations of the Sar1B gene coding for Sar1 GTPase are associated with chylomicron retention disease (CRD). The aim of this study was to describe the phenotypic expression of CRD in two clinically and genetically well characterized cohorts, and to compare their long term evolution. The study in 7 children from France ((X) over bar age 11.3 +/- 1.7years) and 9 from Quebec, Canada ((X) over bar age 12 +/- 2.5years) involved data collection from medical records for growth evaluation, neurological and ophthalmological status as well as bone density over an average follow-up period of 4.9 years for the French cohort and of 10.6 years for the Canadian one. All CRD patients presented within the first few months of life with diarrhea and failure to thrive. Severe hypocholesterolemia coupled with normal triglycerides was associated with low LDL and HDL-cholesterol, as well as with low apolipoproteins A-I and B. Varying degrees of essential fatty acid and of vitamin E deficiency were observed. The earlier diagnosis in the Canadian cohort (1.3 +/- 0.04 years) than in the French one (6.3 +/- 1.3 years) was unrelated with the severity of presenting symptoms. The fact that the disease had more impact on growth and bone density in the latter group may be related to delayed diagnosis of the disease. Vitamin E deficiency led to functional neurological and ophthalmic changes in a small number of patients but only one developed areflexia. Finally, genotype-phenotype correlation is not obvious in our cohort with CRD; even if, the Canadian subjects with the allele 409G>A had a more severe degree (P < 0.001) of hypocholesterolemia than the other patients, many clinical data are inconsistent with a hypothetical genotype-phenotype correlation. This study provides new insights on the phenotypic expression of CRD over time and emphasizes the need to screen the lipid profile of infants with chronic diarrhea and failure to thrive.

Exposure to emotional facial expressions also may lead to subtle facial movements that mirror those expressions. Seven participants were recorded with motion capture as they watched and imitated phrases of emotional singing. Four different participants were recorded using facial electromyography (EMG) while performing the same task. Participants saw and heard recordings of musical phrases sung with happy, sad, and neutral emotional connotations. They then imitated the target stimulus, paying close attention to the emotion expressed. Facial expressions were monitored during four epochs: (a) during the target; (b) prior to their imitation; (c) during their imitation; and (d) after their imitation. Expressive activity was observed in all epochs, implicating a role of facial expressions in the perception, planning, production, and post-production of emotional singing.

However, the specific effects on the brain, behaviour and cognition emerge as a function of the timing and the duration of the exposure, and some also depend on the interaction between gene effects and previous exposure to environmental adversity. Advances in animal and human studies have made it possible to synthesize these findings, and in this Review a model is developed to explain why different disorders emerge in individuals exposed to stress at different times in their lives.

As a result, simulators that integrate spike coding and artificial or real-world platforms are scarce. In this paper, we present artificial intelligence simulator of cognition, a software simulator designed to explore the computational power of pulsed coding at the level of small cognitive systems. Our focus is on convivial graphical user interface, real-time operation and multilevel Hebbian synaptic adaptation, accomplished through a set of non-linear dynamic weights and on-line, life-long modulation. Inclusions of transducer and hormone components, intrinsic oscillator and several learning functions in a discrete spiking neural algorithm are distinctive features of the software. Additional features are the easy link between the production of specific neural architectures and an artificial 2D-world simulator, where one or more animats implement an input-output transfer function in real-time, as do robots in the real world. As a result, the simulator code is exportable to a robot's microprocessor. This realistic neural model is thus amenable to investigate several time related cognitive problems.

Among those triplet repeat expansions, polyalanine tract elongations are associated with early developmental abnormalities with the exception of OPMD, a late onset muscular dystrophy. This review presents an overview of recent advances on the molecular mechanisms underlying the group of polyalanine diseases and provides insights into the pathological impact of polyalanine tract expansion on protein dysfunction. While hydrophobic polyalanine tracts in the normal range are considered to be flexible spacers that confer stability and flexibility to the protein three-dimensional conformation, expanded polyalanine repeats are thought to destabilize the native conformation of the protein and alter protein levels and activity. Protein dysfunction following polyalanine expansion has been reported to cause transcriptional dysregulation which may delay early developmental processes or induce cytotoxicity in polyalanine disease models.

It is due to repeated microhemorrhages in the subarachnoid spaces resulting in a deposit of hemosiderin at the surface of the central nervous system and/or the cranial nerves. The Origin of microhemorrhages remains Unknown in almost one third of cases and therefore no treatment can be recommended. Through it literature review and new observations, our goal is to detail the outcome of patients with a recognized etiology of SS and treated surgically. Methods.-Series of three cases and review of the literature. Results.-We present three patients with symptomatic SS for whom the origin of microhemorrhages was found. The first two patients complained of longstanding ataxia and neurosensory deafness while the third patient presented with urinary retention, vertigo, diplopia and facial paresis. Neuroradiological explorations revealed a left temporoparietal cavernoma, it fronto-orbital arterio-venous malformation and it cauda equina myxo-papillary ependymoma respectively. Surgical resection of file Source of hemorrhage was performed in all cases. All outcomes were good with improvement of their SS-related symptoms. These cases are discussed and the current literature is reviewed. Conclusion.-It is important to recognize SS since the treatment of the bleeding source may prevent further deterioration and may every in some cases improve the clinical condition.

As one of the applications of the atlas, automated brain segmentation was performed and the accuracy was measured using Large Deformation Diffeomorphic Metric Mapping (LDDMM). High-quality diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data from a single-participant were B0-distortion-corrected and transformed to the ICBM-152 atlas or to Talairach coordinates. The deep white matter structures, which have been previously well documented and clearly identified by DTI, were manually segmented. The superficial white matter areas beneath the cortex were defined, based on a population-averaged white matter probability map. The white matter was parcellated into 176 regions based on the anatomical labeling in the ICBM-DTI-81 atlas. The automated parcellation was achieved by warping this parcellation map to normal controls and to Alzheimer's disease patients with severe anatomical atrophy. The parcellation accuracy was measured by a kappa analysis between the automated and manual parcellation at 11 anatomical regions. The kappa values were 0.70 for both normal controls and patients while the inter-rater reproducibility was 0.81 (controls) and 0.82 (patients), suggesting "almost perfect" agreement. A power analysis suggested that the proposed method is suitable for detecting FA and size abnormalities of the white matter in clinical studies. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Increased dopamine release in the right anterior cingulate cortex during the performance of a sorting task: A [C-11] FLB 457 PET study	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						FLB 457; Positron emission tomography; Executive function; Anterior cingulate cortex; Dopamine; Conflict monitoring	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; DORSOLATERAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; PARKINSONS-DISEASE PATIENTS; MEDIAL FRONTAL-CORTEX; WORKING-MEMORY; RECEPTOR-BINDING; HUMAN-BRAIN; HEMISPHERIC-ASYMMETRY; EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONS; COGNITIVE DEFICITS	There is clear evidence that the prefrontal cortex is strongly involved in executive processes and that dopamine can influence performance on working memory tasks. Although, some studies have emphasized the role of striatal dopamine in executive functions, the role played by prefrontal dopamine during executive tasks is unknown. In order to investigate cortical dopamine transmission during executive function, we used D-2-dopamine receptor ligand [C-11] FLB 457 PET in healthy subjects while performing the Montreal Card Sorting Task (MCST). During the retrieval with shift task of the MCST, the subjects had to match each test card to one of the reference cards based on a classification rule (color, shape or number) determined by comparing the previously viewed cue card and the current test card. A reduction in [C-11] FLB 457 binding potential in the right dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) was observed when subjects performed the active task compared to the control task. These findings may suggest that right dorsal ACC dopamine neurotransmission increases significantly during the performance of certain executive processes, e. g., conflict monitoring, in keeping with previous evidence from fMRI studies showing ACC activation during similar tasks. These results may provide some insights on the origin of cognitive deficits underlying certain neurological disorders associated with dopamine dysfunction, such as Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia.

The ability to generate vivid images of movements is variable across individuals and likely influenced by sensorimotor inputs. Objectives. The authors examined (1) the vividness of motor imagery in dancers and in persons with late blindness, with amputation or an immobilization of one lower limb; (2) the effects of prosthesis use on motor imagery; and (3) the temporal characteristics of motor imagery. Methods. Eleven dancers, 10 persons with late blindness, 14 with amputation, 6 with immobilization, and 2 groups of age-matched healthy individuals (27 in control group A; 35 in control group B) participated. The Kinesthetic and Visual Imagery Questionnaire served to assess motor imagery vividness. Temporal characteristics were assessed with mental chronometry. Results. The late blindness group and dance group displayed higher imagery scores than respective control groups. In the amputation and immobilization groups, imagery scores were lower on the affected side than the intact side and specifically for imagined foot movements. Imagery scores of the affected limb positively correlated with the time since walking with prosthesis. Movement times during imagination and execution (amputation and immobilization) were longer on the affected side than the intact side, but the temporal congruence between real and imagined movement times was similar to that in the control group. Conclusions. The mental representation of actions is highly modulated by imagery practice and motor activities. The ability to generate vivid images of movements can be specifically weakened by limb loss or disuse, but lack of movement does not affect the temporal characteristics of motor imagery.

Study Design: Retrospective chart review in a tertiary care center. Methods: One hundred twenty-two patients were included in the study and divided into 2 groups: 1) patients presenting a VS (n = 74) and 2) patients without VS (n = 48). They had received an audiometry assessment, an ENG, and a posterior fossa magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In addition, a variety of risk factors and clinical data were collected. Mean hearing threshold by frequency, mean asymmetries by frequency, speech discrimination score (SDS), ENG results, and presence or absence of vertigo are studied. Cochleovestibular symptoms and atherosclerotic potential risk factors were collected. Characteristics were studied with analysis of variance, chi(2) test, or a paired t test. A receiver operating characteristic curve was obtained. A logistic regression with a step-wise selection based on the likelihood ratio was used to identify the best subgroup of predictors of the VS. Results: The most revealing data were the mean ASNHL at 3,000 Hz (p < 0.001), the interaural SDS asymmetry (p < 0.001), the vestibular deficit (p < 0.049), and the absence of vertigo (p < 0.001). The ASNHL at 3,000 Hz was the most representative value of all the frequencies and for the SDS asymmetry. Interaural difference of 15 dB or more at 3,000 Hz is sufficient to consider hearing loss as asymmetric. When the cutoff for a positive test was placed at 50% probability, the receiver operating characteristic curve shows a sensitivity of 73%. The grade of the tumor was also related with the degree of ASNHL at 3,000 Hz. Caloric test does not predict the localization or the grade of the VS. Tinnitus and atherosclerotic potential risk factors were not considered significantly linked with VS. Conclusion: To reduce the number of negative MRI performed in the investigation of an ASNHL, we propose the "rule 3,000" ASNHL of 15 dB or more at the 3,000-Hz frequency. In this case, an investigation with MRI is crucial. If this ASNHL is less than 15 dB, we recommend a biannual audiometric follow-up.

Our previous studies have shown that common variants of the human paired-box 2 (PAX2) gene (a transcriptional activator of GDNF) and rearranged during transfection (RET) gene (encoding the cognate receptor for GDNF) are associated with a subtle reduction in the kidney size of newborns. Since heterozygosity for a mutant GDNF allele causes mild renal hypoplasia and modest hypertension in mice, we considered the possibility that common variants of the GDNF gene might also contribute to renal hypoplasia in humans. We studied the relationship between newborn renal size or umbilical cord cystatin C and 19 common GDNF gene variants [minor allele frequency (MAF) > 5%], three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) related to a putative PAX binding site and one rare SNP (rs36119840 A/G) which changes an amino acid (R93W), based on data from the haplotype map of the human genome (HapMap). However, none of these 23 SNPs was associated with reduced newborn kidney size or function. Among the 163 Caucasians in our cohort, none had the R93W allele.

The prevalence of autistic disorder has increased in recent surveys and Current estimates of prevalence are around 20/10,000, whereas the prevalence for PDD not otherwise specified is around 30/10,000 in recent surveys. Prevalence of Asperger disorder is much lower than that for autistic disorder and childhood disintegrative disorder is a very rare disorder with a prevalence of about 2/100,000. Combined all together, recent studies that have examined the whole spectrum of PDDs have consistently provided estimates in the 60-70/10,000 range, making PDD one of the most frequent childhood neurodevelopmental disorders. The meaning of the increase in prevalence in recent decades is reviewed. There is evidence that the broadening of the concept, the expansion of diagnostic criteria, the development of services, and improved awareness of the condition have played a major role in explaining this increase, although it cannot be ruled out that other factors might have also contributed to that trend.

Birth parameters have been hypothesized to have an influence on IQ. However, studies within the range of normal birth size have been sparse. With this study we examined the associations between birth length, birth weight, head circumference, and gestational age within the normal birth size range in relation to childhood IQ in Asian children. METHODS. A cohort of 1979 of 2913 Asian children aged 7 to 9 years, recruited from 3 schools in Singapore, were followed yearly from 1999 onward. Birth parameters were recorded by health personnel. Childhood IQ was measured with the Raven's Standard Progressive Matrices at ages 8 to 12. RESULTS. The mean IQ score across the sample (n = 1645) was 114.2. After controlling for multiple confounders for every 1-cm increment in birth length, 1 kg in birth weight, or 1 cm in head circumference, there was a corresponding increase in IQ of 0.49 points (P for trend < .001), 2.19 points (P for trend = .007) and .62 points (P for trend = .003), respectively. These associations persisted even after exclusion of premature children and children with extreme weights and head circumferences. CONCLUSIONS. Longer birth length, higher birth weight, or larger head circumferences within the normal birth size range are associated with higher IQ scores in Asian children. Our results suggest that antenatal factors reflected in altered rates of growth but within the normative range of pregnancy experiences play a role in generating cognitive potential. This has implications for targeting early intervention and preventative programs. Pediatrics 2009; 123: e1011-e1016	[Broekman, Birit F.

CDF Collaboration	Search for WW and WZ production in lepton plus jets final state at CDF	PHYSICAL REVIEW D			English	Article								We present a search for WW and WZ production in final states that contain a charged lepton (electron or muon) and at least two jets, produced in root s = 1.96 TeV p (p) over bar collisions at the Fermilab Tevatron, using data corresponding to 1.2 fb(-1) of integrated luminosity collected with the CDF II detector. Diboson production in this decay channel has yet to be observed at hadron colliders due to the large single W plus jets background. An artificial neural network has been developed to increase signal sensitivity, as compared with an event selection based on conventional cuts. We set a 95% confidence level upper limit of sigma(WW) x BR(W -> l nu(l), W -> jets) + sigma(WZ) x BR(W -> l nu(l), Z -> jets) < 2.88 pb, which is consistent with the standard model next-to-leading-order cross section calculation for this decay channel of 2.09 +/- 0.12 pb.

Methods: Eighty-two participants with schizophrenia living in the community were assessed during their performance of a daily activity (meal preparation). Measures included a performance-based assessment for evaluating information-processing skills-the Perceive, Recall, Plan, and Perform System of Task Analysis-community functioning and symptom assessments, and neuropsychological tests from the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery. Research participants were classified as having high efficiency or low efficiency according to their score on the performance-based assessment and were compared on the functional, cognitive, and symptoms variables. Results: Participants committed various errors, and functional limitations, namely problematic information-processing skills in the perceive, recall, and plan quadrants, were observed during the daily task performance. Participants from the high-efficiency group were more independent in their living skills and more successful in attaining residential independence compared with participants from the low-efficiency group. The only cognitive test that differentiated both groups was the visuospatial associative learning test. No differences were found in the severity of symptoms. Conclusions: Findings suggest that both performance in a daily task and memory and specifically associative learning capacity-provide key information for the level of residential independence. Interventions aiming for the efficient use of information-processing skills during daily tasks among persons with schizophrenia should be carried out accordingly.

Pure progressive amnesia: An amnestic syndrome with preserved independence in daily life	REVUE NEUROLOGIQUE			French	Article						Amnesia; Alzheimer disease; Recognition memory; Spatial memory; Neurodegenerative diseases; Dementia	MEDIAL TEMPORAL-LOBE; BILATERAL HIPPOCAMPAL-LESIONS; VISUAL RECOGNITION MEMORY; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; DEVELOPMENTAL AMNESIA; FORNIX TRANSECTION; COGNITIVE RESERVE; PERIRHINAL CORTEX; EPISODIC MEMORY; INSIDIOUS ONSET	Introduction. - Pure progressive amnesia, a form of progressive focal cortical atrophy is thought to represent the early stages of a rare form of Alzheimer's disease (AD). This syndrome is characterized by the insidious and slowly progressive breakdown of memory, in the absence of a significant impairment in other cognitive domains or in the realm of behavior. The aims of the present study were to contribute to the characterization of this poorly documented type of amnesia, to compare it with other forms of amnestic syndromes resulting from lesions to the medial temporal lobes and to discuss its potential pathophysiological basis. Patients and method. - We carried out three single case studies in patients presenting with pure progressive amnesia. They all underwent a neuropsychological evaluation that included an extensive assessment of spatial and recognition memory, along with brain magnetic resonance imaging and a cerebral blood flow study. Results. - All three patients had a severe deficit in the Storage of context-free information, along with a severe visual recognition memory impairment, as previously reported in a case study on a patient with pure progressive amnesia (Cognitive Neuropsychology 23 (2006) 1230-1247). Yet, spatial memory remained well preserved, and patients maintained totally independent in everyday life. In addition, a significant atrophy of the medial temporal structures was found. Discussion. - This specific pattern of impairment differs from other types of amnestic syndromes after medial temporal damage and raises the question of lesional topography, as well as possible compensatory phenomena. We suggest that pure progressive amnesia results from selective damage to the ventral subhippocampal route into the hippocampal formation leading to impaired context-free memory. Spatial memory may remain intact because the dorsal parahippocampal route into the hippocampus remains functional. Pure progressive amnesia may contribute to a better understanding of the neural systems involved in declarative memory and provide a better understanding into the nature of the memory impairment that characterizes the initial stages of AD.

Design: Prospective case-control study. Setting: University hospital-based sleep research laboratory. Participants: Thirteen normotensive subjects with chronic primary insomnia (9 women, 42 +/- 7 y) and 13 sex- and age-matched good sleepers. Measurements and results: Subjects underwent 2-week sleep diary and 3 sleep studies to provide subjective and objective sleep variables, and 24-h beat-to-beat BP recording to provide daytime, night-time and day-to-night BP changes ([nighttime-daytime]/daytime)(star)100) (BP dipping). Spectral analysis of the electroencephalogram (EEG) was also performed during sleep of night 3 to assess EEG activity in the beta frequency (16-32 Hz), a measure of brain cortical activation. Nighttime SBP was higher (111 +/- 15 vs 102 +/- 12 mm Hg, P < 0.01) and day-tonight SBP dipping was lower (-8% +/- 6% vs -15% +/- 5%, P < 0.01) in insomniacs than good sleepers. Insomniacs also had higher activity in EEG beta frequency (P < 0.05). Higher nighttime SBP and smaller SBP dipping were independently associated with increased EEG beta activity (P < 0.05). Conclusions: Higher nighttime SBP and blunted day-to-night SBP dipping are present in normotensive subjects with chronic insomnia and are associated with a hyperactivity of the central nervous system during sleep. An altered BP profile in insomniacs could be one mechanism implicated in the link between insomnia and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality documented in epidemiological studies.

Sander		FIA Study Investigators	Greater Rupture Risk for Familial as Compared to Sporadic Unruptured Intracranial Aneurysms	STROKE			English	Article						intracranial aneurysm; familial; magnetic resonance angiography; risk of rupture; smoking	NATURAL-HISTORY	Background and Purpose-The risk of intracranial aneurysm (IA) rupture in asymptomatic members of families who have multiple affected individuals is not known. Methods-First-degree unaffected relatives of those with a familial history of IA who had a history of smoking or hypertension but no known IA were offered cerebral MR angiography (MRA) and followed yearly as part of a National Institute of Neurological Diseases and Stroke-funded study of familial IA (Familial Intracranial Aneurysm [FIA] Study). Results-A total of 2874 subjects from 542 FIA Study families were enrolled. After study enrollment, MRAs were performed in 548 FIA Study family members with no known history of IA. Of these 548 subjects, 113 subjects (20.6%) had 148 IAs by MRA of whom 5 subjects had IA >= 7 mm. Two subjects with an unruptured IA by MRA/CT angiography (3-mm and 4-mm anterior communicating artery) subsequently had rupture of their IA. This represents an annual rate of 1.2 ruptures per 100 subjects (1.2% per year; 95% CI, 0.14% to 4.3% per year). None of the 435 subjects with a negative MRA have had a ruptured IA. Survival curves between the MRA-positive and -negative cohorts were significantly different (P=0.004). This rupture rate of unruptured IA in the FIA Study cohort of 1.2% per year is approximately 17 times higher than the rupture rate for subjects with an unruptured IA in the International Study of Unruptured Aneurysm Study with a matched distribution of IA size and location 0.069% per year. Conclusions-Small unruptured IAs in patients from FIA Study families may have a higher risk of rupture than sporadic unruptured IAs of similar size, which should be considered in the management of these patients.

The data base is composed of daily water temperature time series recorded at 48 hydrometric stations in Quebec (Canada) and northern US, as well as the geographic and physiographic variables extracted from the 48 associated drainage basins. The impact of individual and combined drainage area characteristics on the stream annual temperature cycle starting date is investigated by testing different combinations of input variables. The best model allows to predict the average temperature onset for a site, given its geographical coordinates and vegetation and lake coverage characteristics, with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 5.6 days. The best ANN model was compared favourably with parametric approaches. (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Daigle, Anik; St-Hilaire, Andre; Ouarda, Taha B. M.

A significant proportion of people suffering from GTS are still symptomatic in adulthood and present other emotional and cognitive difficulties, along with motor problems that often accompany these comorbid conditions. The nature of these difficulties is still poorly understood and multiple comorbidities are often inadequately controlled. The Current study investigates both stimulus evaluation and motor processing in GTS while controlling for comorbidity. Fifteen adults with GTS and 20 control participants were matched on gender, laterality and intelligence. The P300 component, the no-go anteriorization (NGA) as well as the stimulus and response-locked lateralized-readiness potentials (S-LRP, R-LRP) were elicited during a stimulus-response compatibility (SRC) paradigm. The standard version of the Stroop Color-Word Test (SCWT) was also administered. Reaction times showed that participants with GTS processed both the SRC and the SCWT more rapidly than the control group, while producing a delayed P300 peak latency. The GTS group also showed faster S-LRP onset in response to the incompatible and faster processing of interference in the SCWT. There was also a tendency toward a greater frontal shift of the NGA in the GTS group. The P300 latency showed that with GTS patients, stimulus evaluation occurs later whereas the overlapping pre-motor response selection processes Occur faster. Our findings are congruent with a probable cortical motor over-activation hypothesis of GTS involving faster motor program selection in processing conflicting SR configuration.

Such timings, coupled with evidence of cerebral asymmetry deficits in schizophrenia, and evidence that asymmetry development and neural tube closure represent concurrent fourth-embryonic-week processes both sensitive to oxidant stress, led us to the hypothesis that pro-oxidant sunlight actions capable of affecting the mother's blood could result in a peri-June peak of inhibition and a peri-December peak of facilitation of both processes. Here, using birth and hand preference data from baseball statistics, we tested the hypothesis's prediction that, as a group representing minimal cerebral lateralization, left-handed players would show the same conception rhythm as that observed in the above disorders. We found that not only strict left-handers (those both batting and throwing left) were most often conceived in May-June but that also strict right-handers and other players denoting more extreme levels of cerebral lateralization were most often conceived in November-December.

Previously, our laboratories demonstrated that heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) and neuropilin-1 (NRP-1), a receptor of VEGF(165), are essential for HTLV-1 entry. Here we investigated whether, as when binding VEGF(165), HSPGs and NRP-1 work in concert during HTLV-1 entry. VEGF(165) binds to the b domain of NRP-1 through both HSPG-dependent and -independent interactions, the latter involving its exon 8. We show that VEGF(165) is a selective competitor of HTLV-1 entry and that HTLV-1 mimics VEGF(165) to recruit HSPGs and NRP-1: (1) the NRP-1 b domain is required for HTLV-1 binding; (2) SU binding to target cells is blocked by the HSPG-binding domain of VEGF(165); (3) the formation of Env/NRP-1 complexes is enhanced by HSPGs; and (4) the HTLV SU contains a motif homologous to VEGF(165) exon 8. This motif directly binds to NRP-1 and is essential for HTLV-1 binding to, internalization into, and infection of CD4(+) T cells and dendritic cells. These findings demonstrate that HSPGs and NRP-1 function as HTLV-1 receptors in a cooperative manner and reveal an unexpected mimicry mechanism that may have major implications in vivo.

Alterations in the excitability of these neurons influence chronic pain development, and expression of the neurokinin 1 receptor (NK-1r) is thought to play a major role in such changes. Novel expression of NK-1r may underlie hyperexcitability in new populations of LI neurons. LI projection neurons can be classified morphologically into fusiform, pyramidal, and multipolar cells, differing in their functional properties, with the pyramidal type being nonnociceptive. In agreement with this, we have shown that spinoparabrachial pyramidal neurons seldom express NK-1r, in contrast with the other two cell types. In this study we investigated in the rat the long-term changes in NK-1r expression by spinoparabrachial LI neurons following the unilateral injection in the hindpaw plantar surface of complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA). Cholera toxin subunit B (CTb) was injected unilaterally into the parabrachial nucleus. Our results revealed that, ipsilaterally, pyramidal neurons were seldom immunoreactive for NK-1r both in saline-injected and in CFA-injected rats, up to 10 days post-CFA. However, a considerable number of pyramidal cells were immunoreactive for NK-1r at 15, 21, and 30 days post-CFA. Our data raise the possibility-which needs to be confirmed by electrophysiology-that most LI projection neurons of the pyramidal type are likely nonnociceptive in naive animals but might become nociceptive following the development of arthritis.

Longitudinal and cross-sectional analysis of atrophy in pharmacoresistant temporal lobe epilepsy	NEUROLOGY			English	Article							AUTOMATED 3-D EXTRACTION; HIPPOCAMPAL SCLEROSIS; FEBRILE SEIZURES; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; VOLUMETRIC MRI; DAMAGE; RECEPTORS; BRAIN; REGISTRATION; PROGRESSION	Background: Whether recurrent epileptic seizures induce brain damage is debated. Disease progression in epilepsy has been evaluated only in a few community-based studies involving patients with seizures well controlled by medication. These studies concluded that epilepsy does not inevitably lead to global cerebral damage. Objective: To track the progression of neocortical atrophy in pharmacoresistant temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) using longitudinal and cross-sectional designs. Methods: Using a fully automated measure of cortical thickness on MRI, we studied a homogeneous sample of patients with pharmacoresistant TLE. In the longitudinal analysis (n = 18), fixed-effect models were used to quantify cortical atrophy over a mean interscan interval of 2.5 years (range = 7 to 90 months). In the cross-sectional analysis (n = 121), we correlated epilepsy duration and thickness. To dissociate normal aging from pathologic progression, we compared aging effects in TLE to healthy controls. Results: The longitudinal analysis mapped progression in ipsilateral temporopolar and central and contralateral orbitofrontal, insular, and angular regions. In patients with more than 14 years of disease, atrophy progressed more rapidly in frontocentral and parietal regions that in those with shorter duration. The cross-sectional study showed progressive atrophy in the mesial and superolateral frontal, and parietal cortices. Conclusions: Our combined cross-sectional and longitudinal analysis in patients with pharmacoresistant temporal lobe epilepsy demonstrated progressive neocortical atrophy over a mean interval of 2.5 years that is distinct from normal aging, likely representing seizure-induced damage. The cumulative character of atrophy underlies the importance of early surgical treatment in this group of patients. Neurology (R) 2009; 72: 1747-1754	[Bernhardt, B. C.; Kim, H.; Evans, A.

A gene for HNA maps to chromosome 17q25.3 where mutations in SEPT9, encoding the septin-9 protein, have been identified. Objective: To determine the frequency and type of mutations in the SEPT9 gene in a new cohort of 42 unrelated HNA pedigrees. Methods: DNA sequencing of all exons and intron-exon boundaries for SEPT9 was carried out in an affected individual in each pedigree from our HNA cohort. Genotyping using microsatellite markers spanning the SEPT9 gene was also used to identify pedigrees with a previously reported founder haplotype. Results: Two missense mutations were found: c.262C > T (p.Arg88Trp) in seven HNA pedigrees and c.278C > T (p.Ser93Phe) in one HNA pedigree. Sequencing of other known exons in SEPT9 detected no additional disease-associated mutations. A founder haplotype, without defined mutations in SEPT9, was present in seven pedigrees. Conclusions: We provide further evidence that mutation of the SEPT9 gene is the molecular basis of some cases of hereditary neuralgic amyotrophy (HNA). DNA sequencing of SEPT9 demonstrates a restricted set of mutations in this cohort of HNA pedigrees. Nonetheless, sequence analysis will have an important role in mutation detection in HNA. Additional techniques will be required to find SEPT9 mutations in an HNA founder haplotype and other pedigrees. Neurology (R) 2009; 72: 1755-1759	[Hannibal, M.

Our prior work has shown that integrin signaling forms part of the cell-cell interactions that ensure only those oligodendrocytes contacting axons survive. Here, therefore, we have asked whether integrins regulate the interactions that lead to myelination. Using homologous recombination to insert a single-copy transgene into the hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl transferase (hprt) locus, we find that mice expressing a dominant-negative beta 1 integrin in myelinating oligodendrocytes require a larger axon diameter to initiate timely myelination. Mice with a conditional deletion of focal adhesion kinase (a signaling molecule activated by integrins) exhibit a similar phenotype. Conversely, transgenic mice expressing dominant-negative beta 3 integrin in oligodendrocytes display no myelination abnormalities. We conclude that beta 1 integrin plays a key role in the axoglial interactions that sense axon size and initiate myelination, such that loss of integrin signaling leads to a delay in myelination of small-diameter axons.

Our findings indicate that the Nemo (Nmo) kinase modulates BMP signaling in motor neurons. nmo mutants show synaptic structural defects at the Drosophila melanogaster larval neuromuscular junction, and providing Nmo in motor neurons rescues these defects. We show that Nmo and the BMP transcription factor Mad can be coimmunoprecipitated and find a genetic interaction between nmo and Mad mutants. Moreover, we demonstrate that Nmo is required for normal distribution and accumulation of phosphorylated Mad in motor neurons. Finally, our results indicate that Nmo phosphorylation of Mad at its N terminus, distinct from the BMP phosphorylation site, is required for normal function of Mad. Based on our findings, we propose a model in which phosphorylation of Mad by Nmo ensures normal accumulation and distribution of Mad and thereby fine tunes BMP signaling in motor neurons.

Few studies have explored how the unique genetic and environmental influences that create twinning affect phenotypes and outcomes. Previous data has shown that twins account for a significant proportion of preterm and low-birth-weight infants, who are at risk for long-term neurodevelopmental disabilities such as cerebral palsy and cognitive impairment. More recently, it has been postulated that even without these co-morbidities, twinning in and of itself may incur a neurodevelopmental disadvantage even among term newborns. The purpose of this review is to report primarily on neuromotor outcomes of twins compared to singletons. In addition, we describe specific environmental risk factors among twins which are associated with poorer outcomes. Several putative neurodevelopmental modulators are explored, including death of a co-twin, chorionicity, birth weight discordance, and twin-twin transfusion. By teasing out environmental influences that potentially influence neurocognitive outcomes, families can receive more specific counseling and developmental services can be provided to those twins at especially high risk, (C) 2009 Wlley-Liss, Inc.

Here we review findings from our work on rhythms of expression of the clock protein Period2 (PER2) in four regions of the limbic forebrain known to be important in the regulation of motivational and emotional states. These regions include the oval nucleus of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNSTov), the central nucleus of the amygdala (CEA), the basolateral amygdala (BLA), and the dentate gyrus (DG). Daily rhythms in the expression of PER2 in these regions are controlled by the master circadian pacemaker, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), but, importantly, they are also sensitive to homeostatic perturbations and to hormonal states that directly influence motivated behavior. Thus, circadian information from the SCN and homeostatic signals are integrated in these regions of the limbic forebrain to affect the temporal organization of motivational and emotional processes.

Familial FTDP-17 Missense Mutations Inhibit Microtubule Assembly-promoting Activity of Tau by Increasing Phosphorylation at Ser(202) in Vitro	JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							PAIRED HELICAL FILAMENTS; GLYCOGEN-SYNTHASE KINASE-3-BETA; CDC2-LIKE PROTEIN-KINASE; CYCLIN-DEPENDENT PROTEIN-KINASE-5; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; FRONTOTEMPORAL DEMENTIA; ABNORMAL PHOSPHORYLATION; MASS-SPECTROMETRY; BRAIN; PATHOLOGY	In Alzheimer disease (AD), frontotemporal dementia and parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17) and other tauopathies, tau accumulates and forms paired helical filaments (PHFs) in the brain. Tau isolated from PHFs is phosphorylated at a number of sites, migrates as similar to 60-, 64-, and 68-kDa bands on SDS-gel, and does not promote microtubule assembly. Upon dephosphorylation, the PHF-tau migrates as similar to 50-60-kDa bands on SDS-gels in a manner similar to tau that is isolated from normal brain and promotes microtubule assembly. The site(s) that inhibits microtubule assembly-promoting activity when phosphorylated in the diseased brain is not known. In this study, when tau was phosphorylated by Cdk5 in vitro, its mobility shifted from similar to 60-kDa bands to similar to 64- and 68-kDa bands in a time-dependent manner. This mobility shift correlated with phosphorylation at Ser(202), and Ser(202) phosphorylation inhibited tau microtubule-assembly promoting activity. When several tau point mutants were analyzed, G272V, P301L, V337M, and R406W mutations associated with FTDP-17, but not nonspecific mutations S214A and S262A, promoted Ser(202) phosphorylation and mobility shift to a similar to 68-kDa band. Furthermore, Ser(202) phosphorylation inhibited the microtubule assembly-promoting activity of FTDP-17 mutants more than of WT. Our data indicate that FTDP-17 missense mutations, by promoting phosphorylation at Ser(202), inhibit the microtubule assembly-promoting activity of tau in vitro, suggesting that Ser(202) phosphorylation plays a major role in the development of NFT pathology in AD and related tauopathies.

The mechanism by which this therapeutic effect occurs remains unknown. In an effort to decipher MSC mode of action, we found that MSC conditioned medium inhibits EAE-derived CD4 T cell activation by suppressing STAT3 phosphorylation via MSC-derived CCL2. Further analysis demonstrates that the effect is dependent on MSC-driven matrix metalloproteinase proteolytic processing of CCL2 to an antagonistic derivative. We also show that antagonistic CCL2 suppresses phosphorylation of AKT and leads to a reciprocal increased phosphorylation of ERK associated with an up-regulation of B7 center dot H1 in CD4 T cells derived from EAE mice. CD4 T cell infiltration of the spinal cord of MSC-treated group was robustly decreased along with reduced plasma levels of IL-17 and TNF-alpha levels and in vitro from restimulated splenocytes. The key role of MSC-derived CCL2 was confirmed by the observed loss of function of CCL2(-/-)MSCs in EAE mice. In summary, this is the first report of MSCs modulating EAE biology via the paracrine conversion of CCL2 from agonist to antagonist of CD4 Th17 cell function.

Nothing is known yet regarding the neural underpinnings of unconditional love. The main goal of this functional magnetic resonance imaging study was to identify the brain regions supporting this form of love. Participants were scanned during a control condition and an experimental condition. In the control condition, participants were instructed to simply look at a series of pictures depicting individuals with intellectual disabilities. In the experimental condition, participants were instructed to feel unconditional love towards the individuals depicted in a series of similar pictures. Significant loci of activation were found, in the experimental condition compared with the control condition, in the middle insula, superior parietal lobule, right periaqueductal gray, right globus pallidus (medial). right caudate nucleus (dorsal head), left ventral tegmental area and left rostro-dorsal anterior cingulate cortex. These results suggest that unconditional love is mediated by a distinct neural network relative to that mediating other emotions. This network contains cerebral structures known to be involved in romantic love or maternal love. Some of these structures represent key components of the brain's reward system.

Shh induces cell fate specification through canonical Shh signaling, mediated by transcription. However, the mechanism by which Shh guides axons is unknown. To study this, we developed an in vitro assay for axon guidance, in which neurons can be imaged while responding to a defined gradient of a chemical cue. Axons of dissociated commissural neurons placed in a Shh gradient turned rapidly toward increasing concentrations of Shh. Consistent with this rapid response, we showed that attraction by Shh does not require transcription. Instead, Shh stimulates the activity of Src family kinase (SFK) members in a Smoothened-dependent manner. Moreover, SFK activity is required for Shh-mediated guidance of commissural axons, but not for induction of Gli transcriptional reporter activity. Together, these results indicate that Shh acts via a rapidly acting, noncanonical signaling pathway to guide axons.

Although CD 133 is widely used as a marker of various somatic and putative cancer stem cells, its contribution to fundamental properties of stem cells such as self-renewal and differentiation remains unknown. CD133 contains a short C-terminal cytoplasmic domain with five tyrosine residues, including a consensus tyrosine phosphorylation site that has not yet been investigated. In this study, we show that CD133 is phosphorylated in human medulloblastoma D283 and Daoy cells, in a Src family kinase-dependent manner. The cytoplasmic domain of CD 133 is tyrosine phosphorylated in Daoy cells overexpressing Src and Fyn tyrosine kinases, as well as in vitro using recombinant proteins. Deletion of the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of CD133 considerably reduced its phosphorylation by Src. To identify the tyrosine phosphorylation sites in CD133, we used matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization quadrupole time-of-flight (MALDI Q-TOF) and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Analysis of tyrosine-phosphorylated CD133 by mass spectrometry and site-directed mutagenesis identified tyrosine-828 and the nonconsensus tyrosine-852 as the major tyrosine phosphorylation sites both in vitro and in intact cells. Identification of CD133 as a substrate for Src-family tyrosine kinases suggests that the cytoplasmic domain of CD133 might play an important role in the regulation of its functions.

Design Time trend analysis. Setting Province of Quebec, Canada. Participants Infants born in 1990-2005 identified with severe congenital heart defects (tetralogy of Fallot, endocardial cushion defects, univentricular hearts, truncus arteriosus, or transposition complexes) in Quebec administrative databases. Methods Data analysed in two time periods (before and after fortification). Birth prevalence measured annually as infants (live and stillbirths) with severe congenital heart defects per 1000 births in Quebec. Changes in the birth prevalence from the period before to the period after fortification were estimated with Poisson regression. Results Among the 1 324 440 births in Quebec in 19902005 there were 2083 infants born with severe congenital heart defects, corresponding to an average birth prevalence of 1.57/1000 births. Time trend analysis showed no change in the birth prevalence of severe birth defects in the nine years before fortification (rate ratio 1.01, 95% confidence interval 0.99 to 1.03), while in the seven years after fortification there was a significant 6% decrease per year (0.94, 0.90 to 0.97). Conclusions Public health measures to increase folic acid intake were followed by a decrease in the birth prevalence of severe congenital heart defects. These findings support the hypothesis that folic acid has a preventive effect on heart defects.

Regulation of inhibitory interneuron activity may therefore have critical consequences on pain perception. Indeed, disinhibition of dorsal horn neuronal networks disrupts the balance between excitation and inhibition and is believed to be a key mechanism underlying different forms of pain hypersensitivity and chronic pain states. In this context, studying the source and the synaptic properties of the inhibitory inputs that the inhibitory interneurons receive is important in order to predict the impact of drug action at the network level. To address this, we studied inhibitory synaptic transmission in lamina II inhibitory interneurons identified under visual guidance in spinal slices taken from transgenic mice expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) under the control of the GAD promoter. The majority of these cells fired tonically to a long depolarizing current pulse. Monosynaptically evoked inhibitory postsynaptic currents (eIPSCs) in these cells were mediated by both GABA(A) and glycine receptors. Consistent with this, both GABA(A) and glycine receptor-mediated miniature IPSCs were recorded in all of the cells. These inhibitory inputs originated at least in part from local lamina II interneurons as verified by simultaneous recordings from pairs of EGFP+ cells. These synapses appeared to have low release probability and displayed potentiation and asynchronous release upon repeated activation. In summary, we report on a previously unexamined component of the dorsal horn circuitry that likely constitutes an essential element of the fine tuning of nociception.

The Effect of Microsaccades on the Correlation between Neural Activity and Behavior in Middle Temporal, Ventral Intraparietal, and Lateral Intraparietal Areas	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							FIXATIONAL EYE-MOVEMENTS; SUBJECTIVE SENSORY EXPERIENCE; PRIMARY VISUAL-CORTEX; MACAQUE MONKEY; ATTENTIONAL MODULATION; NEURONAL RESPONSES; MOTION-DETECTION; DECISION-MAKING; DETECTION TASK; MT	It is widely reported that the activity of single neurons in visual cortex is correlated with the perceptual decision of the subject. The strength of this correlation has implications for the neuronal populations generating the percepts. Here we asked whether microsaccades, which are small, involuntary eye movements, contribute to the correlation between neural activity and behavior. We analyzed data from three different visual detection experiments, with neural recordings from the middle temporal (MT), lateral intraparietal (LIP), and ventral intraparietal (VIP) areas. All three experiments used random dot motion stimuli, with the animals required to detect a transient or sustained change in the speed or strength of motion. We found that microsaccades suppressed neural activity and inhibited detection of the motion stimulus, contributing to the correlation between neural activity and detection behavior. Microsaccades accounted for as much as 19% of the correlation for area MT, 21% for area LIP, and 17% for VIP. While microsaccades only explain part of the correlation between neural activity and behavior, their effect has implications when considering the neuronal populations underlying perceptual decisions.

The Cystatin B gene is mutated in one of the most common forms of progressive myoclonus epilepsy, Unverricht-Lundborg disease (EPM1). Cystatin B knockout in a mouse model of EPM1 triggers progressive degeneration of cerebellar granule neurons. Here, we report impaired redox homeostasis as a key mechanism by which Cystatin B deficiency triggers neurodegeneration. Oxidative stress induces the expression of Cystatin B in cerebellar granule neurons, and EPM1 patient-linked mutation of the Cystatin B gene promoter impairs oxidative stress induction of Cystatin B transcription. Importantly, Cystatin B knockout or knockdown sensitizes cerebellar granule neurons to oxidative stress-induced cell death. The Cystatin B deficiency-induced predisposition to oxidative stress in neurons is mediated by the lysosomal protease Cathepsin B. We uncover evidence of oxidative damage, reflected by depletion of antioxidants and increased lipid peroxidation, in the cerebellum of Cystatin B knock-out mice in vivo. Collectively, our findings define a pathophysiological mechanism in EPM1, whereby Cystatin B deficiency couples oxidative stress to neuronal death and degeneration, and may thus provide the basis for novel treatment approaches for the progressive myoclonus epilepsies.

Here, we describe gaze movements evoked in the head-fixed and head-unrestrained monkey by electrical stimulation of the polysensory zone. Centring eye movements were elicited at all sites and under both conditions. With the head free to move, ipsilateral head movements always accompanied evoked eye movements and carried gaze into a final steady-state position in ipsilateral body space. Our results support the hypothesis that stimulation of the polysensory zone generates avoidance behaviours in which gaze is moved away from a head-directed threatening stimulus.

Statin Therapy Inhibits Remyelination in the Central Nervous System	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PATHOLOGY			English	Article							MULTIPLE-SCLEROSIS LESIONS; COA REDUCTASE INHIBITOR; PROGENITOR CELLS; IN-VIVO; SPINAL-CORD; ADULT HUMAN; MAGNETIZATION-TRANSFER; INDUCED DEMYELINATION; GENE-EXPRESSION; MYELIN PROTEINS	Remyelination of lesions in the central nervous system contributes to neural repair following clinical relapses in multiple sclerosis. Remyelination is initiated by recruitment and differentiation of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) into myelinating oligodendrocytes. Simvastatin, a blood-brain barrier-permeable statin in multiple sclerosis clinical trials, has been shown to impact the in vitro processes that have been implicated in remyelination. Animals were fed a cuprizone-supplemented diet for 6 weeks to induce localized demyelination in the corpus callosum; subsequent return to normal diet for 3 weeks stimulated remyelination. Simvastatin was injected intraperitoneally during the period of coincident demyelination and OPC maturation (weeks 4 to 6), throughout the entire period of OPC responses (weeks 4 to 9), or during the remyelination-only phase (weeks 7 to 9). Simvastatin treatment (weeks 4 to 6) caused a decrease in myelin load and both Olig2(strong) and Nkx2.2(strong) OPC numbers. Simvastatin treatment (weeks 4 to 9 and 7 to 9) caused a decrease in myelin load, which was correlated with a reduction in Nkx2.2(strong) OPCs and an increase in Olig2(strong) cells, suggesting that OPCs were maintained in an immature state (Olig2(strong)/Nkx2.2(weak)). NogoA+ oligodendrocyte numbers were decreased during all simvastatin treatment regimens. Our findings suggest that simvastatin inhibits central nervous system remyelination by blocking progenitor differentiation, indicating the need to monitor effects of systemic immunotherapies that can access the central nervous system on brain tissue-repair processes.

Intubation using a luminous stylet, such as the Trachlight (R) (TL), also produces minimal motion of the c-spine and may be an interesting alternative technique for patients with an unstable c-spine. In this study, we compared the cervical motion caused by the TL and the FOB during intubation. METHODS: Twenty patients with a normal c-spine undergoing general anesthesia, including neuromuscular blockade, for a neuroradiologic intervention were included in a prospective, randomized, controlled, nonblinded, crossover trial. Each patient was tracheally intubated sequentially with the TL and the FOB in a randomized order. Manual in-line stabilization was applied by an assistant during intubation. The motions produced by intubation from the occiput (C0) to C5 were recorded in the sagittal plane using continuous cinefluoroscopy. For movement analysis, the recordings were divided into four stages: "baseline" before intubation began; "introduction" of the intubation device; "intubation" (passage of the tube through the vocal cords); and "removal" of the device. For each intubating device, the average maximal segmental motion observed in every patient at any stage or cervical segment was calculated and compared using Student's t-test. The time required to intubate with each device was also compared. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in the mean maximum segmental motion produced during intubation with the TL versus the FOB (12 degrees +/- 6 degrees vs 11 degrees +/- 5 degrees; P = 0.5). Segmental movements occurred predominantly at the C0-1 and C1-2 levels, and maximal movements were observed during the introduction stage in 18/20 patients for both devices. Intubation took less time with the TL (34 17 vs 60 +/- 15s, P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: In patients under general anesthesia with neuromuscular blockade and manual in-line stabilization, we found no difference in the segmental c-spine motion produced during endotracheal intubation using the FOB and the TL.

Recent data show that RA for CEA is associated with fewer postoperative complications. The aim of the present study was to assess hemodynamic stability and vasoactive drug use for CEA performed under RA versus general anesthesia (GA). All patients undergoing CEA from January 2005 to January 2006 were identified from our prospective database. Electronic and paper charts were reviewed. Intraoperative monitoring data were reviewed retrospectively. Hypotension was defined as systolic blood pressure (SBP) < 100 mm Hg and deemed prolonged if it lasted more than 10 min. Hypertension was defined as SBP > 160 mm Hg. BP variation was defined as the difference between the highest and lowest SBP, and bradycardia as heart rate (HR) below 60. The data were expressed as means +/- standard deviation. Seventy-two consecutive patients underwent CEA: 25 under RA and 47 under GA. There was no difference in preoperative HR and BP. Most patients had symptomatic severe carotid stenosis (80% in RA vs. 85% in GA, nonsignificant). Intraoperatively, RA was associated with less BP variation (60 +/- 27 vs. 78 +/- 22 mm Hg, p = 0.005), bradycardia (5% vs. 63%, p < 0.001), hypotension (20% vs. 70%, p < 0.01), and prolonged hypotension (0% vs. 23%, p = 0.009) and more hypertension (80% vs. 47%, p = 0.007). Vasopressor requirements were less frequent under RA (20% vs. 77%, p < 0.001). There was no significant difference between groups in hypotension or hypertension episodes seen in the postoperative recovery room. RA was associated with less hypotension and less vasopressor used during CEA compared to GA. The improved hemodynamic stability may account for the lower incidence of complications after CEA.

Aberrations in the generation or action of IGF have been suggested to play an important role in several pathological conditions, including metabolic disorders, neurodegenerative diseases, and multiple types of cancer. Yet the exact mechanism involved in the pathogenesis of these diseases by IGFs remains obscure. Redox pathways involving reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) contribute to the pathogenetic mechanism of various diseases by modifying key signaling pathways involved in cell growth, proliferation, survival, and apoptosis. Furthermore, ROS and RNS have been demonstrated to alter IGF production and/or action, and vice versa, and thereby have the ability to modulate cellular functions, leading to clinical manifestations of diseases. In this review, we provide an overview on the IGF system and discuss the potential role of IGF-1/IGF-1 receptor and redox pathways in the pathophysiology of several diseases. Antioxid.

Extrusion of transmitter, water and ions generates forces to close fusion pore	BIOCHIMICA ET BIOPHYSICA ACTA-BIOMEMBRANES			English	Article						Fusion pore; Nanofluidic; Transmitter; Pore dynamics; Exocytosis; Poisson-Nernst-Planck; Navier-Stokes; Transport; Porous media; Nano-electromechanical system	QUANTAL SIZE; SYNAPTIC VESICLES; NEUROMUSCULAR-JUNCTION; HIPPOCAMPAL SYNAPSES; CHROMAFFIN GRANULES; SECRETORY GRANULES; CONTINUUM-THEORIES; BROWNIAN DYNAMICS; CARBON NANOTUBE; SURFACE-CHARGE	During exocytosis the fusion pore opens rapidly, then dilates gradually, and may subsequently close completely, but what controls its dynamics is not well understood. In this study we focus our attention on forces acting on the pore wall, and which are generated solely by the passage of transmitter, ions and water through the open fusion pore. The transport through the charged cylindrical nano-size pore is simulated using a coupled system of Poisson-Nernst-Planck and Navier-Stokes equations and the forces that act radially on the wall of the fusion pore are then estimated. Four forces are considered: a) inertial force, b) pressure, c) viscotic force, and d) electrostatic force. The inertial and viscotic forces are small, but the electrostatic force and the pressure are typically significant. High vesicular pressure tends to open the fusion pore, but the pressure induced by the transport of charged particles (glutamate, ions), which is predominant when the pore wall charge density is high tends to close the pore. The electrostatic force, which also depends on the charge density on the pore wall, is weakly repulsive before the pore dilates, but becomes attractive and pronounced as the pore dilates. Given that the vesicular concentration of free transmitter can change rapidly due to the release, or owing to the dissociation from the gel matrix. we evaluated how much and how rapidly a change of the vesicular K(+)-glutamate(-) concentration affects the concentration of glutamate(-) and ions in the pore and how such changes alter the radial force on the wall of the fusion pore. A step-like rise of the vesicular K(+)-glutamate(-) concentration leads to a chain of events. Pore concentration (and efflux) of both K(+) and glutamate(-) rise reaching their new steady-state values in less than 100 ns. Interestingly within a similar time interval the pore concentration of Na(+) also rises, whereas that of Cl(-) diminishes, although their extra-cellular concentration does not change. Finally such changes affect also the water movement. Water efflux changes bi-phasically, first increasing before decreasing to a new, but lower steady-state value. Nevertheless, even under such conditions an overall approximate neutrality of the pore is maintained remarkably well, and the electrostatic, but also inertial, viscotic and pressure forces acting on the pore wall remain constant. In conclusion the extrusion of the vesicular content generates forces, primarily the force due to the electro-kinetically induced pressure and electrostatic force (both influenced by the pore radius and even more by the charge density on the pore wall). which tend to close the fusion pore.

Speed encoding in correlation motion detectors as a consequence of spatial structure	BIOLOGICAL CYBERNETICS			English	Article						Motion vision; Reichardt detector; Pattern dependence; Speed tuning	CHLOROPHANUS-VIRIDIS; MODEL; PERCEPTION; VELOCITY; SYSTEM; NEURONS; CORTEX; CELLS; FLY	For animals to carry out a wide range of detection, recognition and navigation tasks, visual motion signals are crucial. The encoding of motion information has therefore, attracted much attention in the experimental and computational study of brain function. Two main alternative mechanisms have been proposed on the basis of behavioural and physiological experiments. On one hand, correlation-type and motion energy detectors are simple and efficient in the design of their basic mechanism but are tuned to temporal frequency rather than to speed. On other hand, gradient-type motion detectors directly represent an estimate of speed, but may require more demanding processing mechanisms. We demonstrate here how the temporal frequency dependence observed for sine-wave gratings can disappear for less constrained stimuli, to be replaced by responses reflecting speed for stimuli like square waves when a phase-sensitive detection mechanism is employed. We conclude from these observations that temporal frequency tuning is not necessarily a limitation for motion vision based on correlation detectors, and more generally demonstrate in view of the typical Fourier composition of natural scenes, that correlation detectors operating in such environments can encode image speed. In the context of our results, we discuss the implications of the loss of phase sensitivity inherent in using a linear system approach to describe neural processing.

However, 4 of the general population experiences a lifelong deficit in music perception that cannot be explained by hearing loss, brain damage, intellectual deficiencies or lack of exposure. This musical disorder, commonly known as tone-deafness and now termed congenital amusia, affects mostly the melodic pitch dimension. Congenital amusia is hereditary and is associated with abnormal grey and white matter in the auditory cortex and the inferior frontal cortex. In order to relate these anatomical anomalies to the behavioural expression of the disorder, we measured the electrical brain activity of amusic subjects and matched controls while they monitored melodies for the presence of pitch anomalies. Contrary to current reports, we show that the amusic brain can track quarter-tone pitch differences, exhibiting an early right-lateralized negative brain response. This suggests near-normal neural processing of musical pitch incongruities in congenital amusia. It is important because it reveals that the amusic brain is equipped with the essential neural circuitry to perceive fine-grained pitch differences. What distinguishes the amusic from the normal brain is the limited awareness of this ability and the lack of responsiveness to the semitone changes that violate musical keys. These findings suggest that, in the amusic brain, the neural pitch representation cannot make contact with musical pitch knowledge along the auditory-frontal neural pathway.

Neuroimaging studies, however, cannot indicate whether a brain region is equally important to all tasks in which it is activated. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that the pre-SMA is an important component of response selection, using an interference technique. High frequency repetitive TMS (10 Hz) was used to interfere with the functioning of the pre-SMA during tasks requiring selection of words and oral gestures under different selection modes (forced, volitional) and attention levels (high attention, low attention). Results show that TMS applied to the pre-SMA interferes selectively with the volitional selection condition, resulting in longer RTs. The low- and high-attention forced selection conditions were unaffected by TMS, demonstrating that the pre-SMA is sensitive to selection mode but not attentional demands. TMS similarly affected the volitional selection of words and oral gestures, reflecting the responseindependent nature of the pre-SMA contribution to response selection. The implications of these results are discussed. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Reorganisation of the Right Occipito-Parietal Stream for Auditory Spatial Processing in Early Blind Humans.

In particular, several studies have demonstrated an extensive activation of occipital brain areas, usually regarded as essentially "visual", when early blind subjects (EB) performed a task that requires spatial processing of sounds. However, little is known about the possible consequences of the activation of occipitals area on the function of the large cortical network known, in sighted subjects, to be involved in the processing of auditory spatial information. To address this issue, we used event-related transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to induce virtual lesions of either the right intra-parietal sulcus (rIPS) or the right dorsal extrastriate occipital cortex (rOC) at different delays in EB subjects performing a sound lateralization task. Surprisingly, TMS applied over rIPS, a region critically involved in the spatial processing of sound in sighted subjects, had no influence on the task performance in EB. In contrast, TMS applied over rOC 50 ms after sound onset, disrupted the spatial processing of sounds originating from the contralateral hemifield. The present study shed new lights on the reorganisation of the cortical network dedicated to the spatial processing of sounds in EB by showing an early contribution of rOC and a lesser involvement of rIPS.

In order to test such new drugs in humans, a model for cognitive impairments induced by low histaminergic functions would be useful. Studies with histamine H(1)-receptor antagonists have shown limitations as a model. Here we evaluated whether depletion of L-histidine, the precursor of histamine, was effective in altering measures associated with histamine in humans and the behavioural and electrophysiological (event-related-potentials) effects. Seventeen healthy volunteers completed a three-way, double-blind, crossover study with L-histidine depletion, L-tyrosine/L-phenylalanine depletion (active control) and placebo as treatments. Interactions with task manipulations in a choice reaction time task were studied. Task demands were increased using visual stimulus degradation and increased response complexity. In addition, subjective and objective measures of sedation and critical tracking task performance were assessed. Measures of sedation and critical tracking task performance were not affected by treatment. L-histidine depletion was effective and enlarged the effect of response complexity as measured with the response-locked lateralized readiness potential onset latency. L-histidine depletion affected response- but not stimulus-related processes, in contrast to the effects of H(1)-receptor antagonists which were previously found to affect primarily stimulus-related processes. L-histidine depletion is promising as a model for histamine-based cognitive impairment. However, these effects need to be confirmed by further studies.

Contributions of neuroimaging, balance testing, electrophysiology and blood markers to the assessment of sport-related concussion	BRITISH JOURNAL OF SPORTS MEDICINE			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	3rd International Conference on Concussion in Sport	NOV, 2008	Zurich, SWITZERLAND				TRAUMATIC BRAIN-INJURY; HEART-RATE-VARIABILITY; NEURON-SPECIFIC ENOLASE; ERROR SCORING SYSTEM; MAGNETIC-RESONANCE-SPECTROSCOPY; SERUM-LEVELS; POSTURAL STABILITY; BIOCHEMICAL MARKERS; FOOTBALL PLAYERS; NEUROCOGNITIVE PERFORMANCE	Objective: To review the diagnostic tests and investigations used in the management of sports concussion, in the adult and paediatric populations, to (a) monitor the severity of symptoms and deficits, (b) track recovery and (c) advance knowledge relating to the natural history and neurobiology of the injury. Design: Qualitative literature review of the neuroimaging, balance testing, electrophysiology, blood marker and concussion literature. Intervention: PubMed and Medline databases were reviewed for investigations used in the management of adult and paediatric concussion, including structural imaging (computerised tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, diffusion tensor imaging), functional imaging (single photon emission computerised tomography, positron emission tomography, functional magnetic resonance imaging), spectroscopy (magnetic resonance spectroscopy, near infrared spectroscopy), balance testing (Balance Error Scoring System, Sensory Organization Test, gait testing, virtual reality), electrophysiological tests (electroencephalography, evoked potentials, event related potentials, magnetoencephalography, heart rate variability), genetics (apolipoprotein E4, channelopathies) and blood markers (S100, neuron-specific enolase, cleaved Tau protein, glutamate). Results: For the adult and paediatric populations, each test has been classified as being: (1) clinically useful, (2) a research tool only or (3) not useful in sports-related concussion. Conclusions: The current status of the diagnostic tests and investigations is analysed, and potential directions for future research are provided. Currently, all tests and investigations, with the exception of clinical balance testing, remain experimental. There is accumulating research, however, that shows promise for the future clinical application of functional magnetic resonance imaging in sport concussion assessment and management.	[Davis, G.

A review of 84 cases of radiation-induced cavernous hemangiomas found in the literature is presented. In this series the mean age at the time of irradiation (+/- SD) was 10.4 +/- 2.0 years (median = 8 years), while the mean time to cavernous hemangioma diagnosis (+/- SD) was 10.3 +/- 1.9 years (median = 8 years). Time to cavernous hemangioma diagnosis was found to be inversely related to radiation dose. Hemorrhage from radiation-induced cavernous hemangiomas was found in 40.0% of patients. with an incidence of 3.9% per patient year. An inverse trend was identified between radiation dose and symptomatic presentation, cavernous hemangioma hemorrhage or surgical resection. This review of radiation-induced cavernous hemangiomas confirms that both Younger Patients and those who received a larger close of radiation are at increased risk of radiation-induced cavernous hemangiomas. Our results suggest that, based on all assessment of CT or MR images, there may be all increased risk of hemorrhage when comparing radiation-induced to congenital cavernous hemangiomas. Increasing radiation doses appear to stabilize these lesions, decreasing the risk of a symptomatic presentation. cavernous hemangioma hemorrhage and surgical intervention.

The Script Concordance Test (SCT), based on script theory from cognitive psychology, uses authentic clinical scenarios to compare a trainee's judgment skills with those of experts. The SCT has been validated in several medical disciplines, but has not been investigated in neurology. Methods: We developed an Internet-based neurology SCT (NSCT) comprising 24 clinical scenarios with three to four questions each. The scenarios were designed to reflect the uncertainty of real-life clinical encounters in adult neurology. The questions explored aspects of the scenario in which several responses might be acceptable; trainees were asked to judge which response they considered to be best. Forty-one PGY1-PGY5 neurology residents and eight medical students from three North American neurology programs (McGill, Calgary, and Mayo Clinic) completed the NSCT. The responses of trainees to each question were compared with the aggregate responses of an expert panel of 16 attending neurologists. Results: The NSCT demonstrated good reliability (Cronbach alpha = 0.79). Neurology residents scored higher than medical students and lower than attending, neurologists. supporting the test's construct validity. Furthermore. NSCT scores discriminated between senior (PGY3-5) and junior residents (PGY1-2). Conclusions: Our NSCT is a practical and reliable instrument. and Our findings support its construct validity for assessing judgment in neurology trainees. The NSCT has potentially widespread applications as ail evaluation tool, both in neurology training and for licensing examinations.

Unlike the familial forms of AD, the genetic and environmental risks factors identified for sporadic AD are extensive. MicroRNAs are one of the major noncoding RNAs that function as negative regulators to silence or suppress gene expression via translational inhibition or message degradation. Their discovery has evoked great excitement in biomedical research for their promise as potential disease biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Key microRNAs have been identified as essential for a variety of cellular events including cell lineage determination, proliferation, apoptosis, DNA repair, and cytoskeletal organization; most, if not all, acting to fine-tune gene expression at the post-transcriptional level in a host of cellular signaling networks. Dysfunctional microRNA-mediated regulation has been implicated in the pathogenesis of many disease states. Here, the current understanding of the role of miRNAs in the central nervous system is reviewed with emphasis on their impact on the etiopathogenesis of sporadic AD.

Although the genes that cause most cases of ALS are still unknown, several important genetic discoveries have been made recently that will bring substantial insight into some of the mechanisms involved in ALS. Mutations in two genes with related functions were recently reported in patients with familial ALS: the FUS/TLS gene at the ALS6 locus on chromosome 16 and the TARDBP gene at the ALS10 locus on chromosome 1. In addition, the first wave of genomewide association studies in ALS has been published. While these studies clearly show that there is no definitive and common highly penetrant allele that causes ALS, some interesting candidate genes emerged from these studies. The findings help to better delineate the types of genes and genetic variants that are involved in ALS and provide substantial material for future research.

Currently available antidepressant therapies have limited efficacies; consequently, research on new drugs for the treatment of mood disorders has become increasingly critical. Recent preclinical evidences that cannabinoid agonists and endocannabinoid enhancers, such as the fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) inhibitors, can impact mood regulation have opened a new line of research in antidepressant drug discovery. However, the neurobiological mechanisms linking the endocannabinoid system with the pathophysiology of mood disorders and antidepressant action remain unclarified. In this review, we have presented an update on preclinical data indicating the antidepressant potential of cannabinoid agonists and endocannabinoid enhancers in comparison to standard antidepressants. Data obtained from CB(1) knockout (CB(1)-/-) and FAAH knockout (FAAH-/-) mice have also been examined within this context. We have illustrated how the various classes of antidepressants exert their therapeutic action. In particular, all antidepressants increase the neurotransmission of serotonin after long-term treatment, enhance the tonic activity of hippocampal 5-HT(1A) receptors, promote neurogenesis, and modulate (decrease or increase) the firing activity of noradrenergic neurons. Interestingly, cannabinoid agonists and endocannabinoid enhancers increase serotonin and noradrenergic neuronal firing activity, increase serotonin release in the hippocampus, as well as promote neurogenesis. Since cannabinoid-derived drugs potentiate monoaminergic neurotransmission and hippocampal neurogenesis through distinct pathways compared to classical antidepressants, they may represent an alternative drug class in the pharmacotherapy of mood and other neuropsychiatric disorders.

Prenatal maternal stress from a natural disaster predicts dermatoglyphic asymmetry in humans	DEVELOPMENT AND PSYCHOPATHOLOGY			English	Article							MINOR PHYSICAL ANOMALIES; FLUCTUATING ASYMMETRY; SCHIZOPHRENIA; CORTISOL; DISORDER; BRAIN; PREGNANCY; GLUCOCORTICOIDS; MORPHOLOGY; TWINS	Dermatoglyphic asymmetry of fingertip ridge counts is more frequent in schizophrenia patients than normal controls, and may reflect disruptions in fetal development during Weeks 14-22 when fingerprints develop. However, there are no data in humans linking specific adverse events at specific times to dermatoglyphic asymmetries. Our objective was to determine whether prenatal exposure to a natural disaster (1998 Quebec ice storm) during Weeks 14-22 would. result in increased dermatoglyphic asymmetry in children, and to determine the roles of maternal objective stress exposure, subjective stress reaction, and postdisaster cortisol. Ridge counts for homologous fingers were scored for 77 children (20 target exposed [Weeks 14-22] and 57 nontarget exposed [exposed during other gestation weeks]). Children in the target group had more than 0.50 SD greater asymmetry than the nontarget group. Within the target group, children whose mother, had high subjective ice storm stress had significantly greater asymmetry than those with lower stress mothers, and maternal postdisaster cortisol had a significant negative correlation with the children's dermatoglyphic asymmetry (r = -.56). Prenatal maternal stress during the period of fingerprint development results in greater dermatoglyphic asymmetry in their children, especially in the face of greater maternal distress.

For individuals whose conditions failed to respond to pharmacotherapy, surgery is the only opportunity for cure. In Uganda, we developed a center for treatment of intractable temporal lobe epilepsy (iTLE) that functions within the technologic and expertise constraints of a severely low resource area. Our model relies on partnership with epilepsy professionals and training of local staff. Patients were prescreened at regional clinics for iTLE. Individuals meeting inclusion criteria were referred to the treating Ugandan hospital (CURE Children's' Hospital of Uganda, CCHU) for video-EEG (electroencephalography), computed tomography (CT) imaging, and neuropsychological evaluation. Data were transferred to epilepsy experts for analysis and treatment recommendations. Ten patients were diagnosed with iTLE and surgically treated at CCHU. Six (60%) were seizure free, and there was no neurologic morbidity or mortality. Our model for surgical treatment of pharmacoresistant TLE has functioned successfully in a true developing world low resource setting.

Different neural strategies for multimodal integration: comparison of two macaque monkey species	EXPERIMENTAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Vestibular; Neck proprioceptive; Active; Passive; VO; PVP	VESTIBULOOCULAR REFLEX SUPPRESSION; NECK PROPRIOCEPTIVE INPUTS; VESTIBULAR NUCLEUS NEURONS; PASSIVE HEAD MOVEMENTS; GAZE SHIFTS; FASTIGIAL NUCLEUS; PRIMATE EVOLUTION; RHESUS-MONKEYS; EYE-MOVEMENTS; DNA EVIDENCE	The integration of neck proprioceptive and vestibular inputs underlies the generation of accurate postural and motor control. Recent studies have shown that central mechanisms underlying the integration of these sensory inputs differ across species. Notably, in rhesus monkey (Macaca mulata), an Old World monkey, neurons in the vestibular nuclei are insensitive to passive stimulation of neck proprioceptors. In contrast, in squirrel monkey, a New World monkey, stimulation produces robust modulation. This has led to the suggestion that there are differences in how sensory information is integrated during self-motion in Old versus New World monkeys. To test this hypothesis, we recorded from neurons in the vestibular nuclei of another species in the Macaca genus [i.e., M. fascicularis (cynomolgus monkey)]. Recordings were made from vestibular-only (VO) and position-vestibular-pause (PVP) neurons. The majority (53%) of neurons in both groups were sensitive to neck proprioceptive and vestibular stimulation during passive body-under-head and whole-body rotation, respectively. Furthermore, responses during passive rotations of the head-on-body were well predicted by the linear summation of vestibular and neck responses (which were typically antagonistic). During active head movement, the responses of VO and PVP neurons were further attenuated (relative to a model based on linear summation) for the duration of the active head movement or gaze shift, respectively. Taken together, our findings show that the brain's strategy for the central processing of sensory information can vary even within a single genus. We suggest that similar divergence may be observed in other areas in which multimodal integration occurs.

Developmental contributions to motor sequence learning	EXPERIMENTAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Motor skill learning; Developmental invariance; Children; Serial; Reaction time; Consolidation; Sensitive period	NORMAL-CHILDREN; WHITE-MATTER; VISUOMOTOR REPRESENTATIONS; SENSITIVE PERIODS; FINGER-MOVEMENTS; IN-VIVO; BRAIN; PERFORMANCE; INDEPENDENCE; ACQUISITION	Little is known about how children acquire new motor sequences. In particular, it is not clear if the same learning progression observed in adults is also present in childhood nor whether motor skills are acquired in a similar fashion across development. In the present study we used the multi-finger sequencing task (MFST), a variant of the serial reaction time (SRT) task, to study motor sequence learning, across two consecutive days, in three cross-sectional samples of children aged 6, 8, and 10 years, and a control sample of adults. In the MFST, participants reproduced 10-element sequences of key presses on an electronic keyboard, using four fingers of the right hand. Each block of practice included 10 intermixed trials of a Repeated (REP) sequence and four trials of Random (RAN) sequences. Performance was assessed by examining changes in accuracy, a component of the task that requires the association of the visual stimulus with the motor response, and response synchronization, a component that requires fine-grained sensorimotor integration and timing. Additionally, participants completed Recognition and Recall tests, to assess explicit knowledge of the repeated sequence. Overall, results showed a developmental progression in motor sequence learning within and across days of practice. Interestingly, the two behavioral measures showed different developmental trajectories. For accuracy, differences were greatest for the two youngest groups early in learning, and these groups also showed the greatest rate of improvement. However, by the end of Day 2, only the 6-year-olds still lagged behind all other groups. For response synchronization, all child groups differed from adults early in learning, but both child and adult groups showed similar rates of improvement across blocks of practice. By the end of Day 2, 10-year-olds reached adult levels of performance, whereas 6- and 8-year-olds did not. Taken together, the dissociation observed with our two behavioral measures of sequence learning is consistent with the hypothesis that accuracy or finger-stimulus association may rely on cortical pathways that show the greatest maturation between ages 6 and 10; whereas motor timing and sensorimotor integration may rely on subcortical pathways that continue to develop into young adulthood. Despite developmental differences across blocks of practice on both behavioral measures, there were no significant group differences for either the Recognition or Recall tests. We suggest that explicit knowledge of the MFST is not directly linked to task performance, thus challenging the implicit-explicit distinction in pediatric SRT studies assessing the developmental invariance model.

The pathway is virtually universally present throughout eukaryotes yet displays different forms in enzyme architecture, substrate specificity, and subcellular location. In this review, we examine beta oxidation across the fungal kingdom by conducting a large-scale in silico screen and localization prediction for all relevant enzymes in > 50 species. The survey reveals that fungi exhibit an astounding diversity of beta oxidation pathways and shows that the combined presence of distinct mitochondrial and peroxisomal pathways is the prevailing and likely ancestral type of beta oxidation in fungi. In addition, the available information indicates that the mitochondrial pathway was lost in the common ancestor of Saccharomycetes. Finally, we infer the existence of a hybrid peroxisomal pathway in several Sordariomycetes, including Neurospora crassa. In these cases, a typically mitochondrion-located enzyme compensates for the lack of a peroxisomal one.

However, one fundamental but vital issue of the impact of different brain parcellation schemes on the network topological architecture remains unclear. Here, we used resting-state functional MRI (fMRI) to investigate the influences of different brain parcellation atlases on the topological organization of brain functional networks. Whole-brain fMRI data were divided into ninety and seventy regions of interest according to two predefined anatomical atlases, respectively. Brain functional networks were constructed by thresholding the correlation matrices among the parcellated regions and further analyzed using graph theoretical approaches. Both atlas-based brain functional networks were found to show robust small-world properties and truncated power-law connectivity degree distributions, which are consistent with previous brain functional and structural networks studies. However, more importantly, we found that there were significant differences in multiple topological parameters (e.g., small-worldness and degree distribution) between the two groups of brain functional networks derived from the two atlases. This study provides quantitative evidence on how the topological organization of brain networks is affected by the different parcellation strategies applied. Hum Brain Mapp 30:1511-1523, 2009.

This paper presents a novel adaptive-network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) for the speed control of interior permanent-magnet synchronous motor (IPMSM) drives. By utilizing a learning technique, the proposed ANFIS can construct an input-output mapping based on both human knowledge (in the form of fuzzy if-then rules) and stipulated input-output data pairs. The back-propagation technique is used for the online tuning of ANFIS parameters in order to optimize the performance of the proposed drive. The proposed control technique also provides flux control to control the motor over a wide speed range. The complete drive has been successfully implemented in real time using digital signal processor board DS1104. The performance of the proposed ANFIS-based IPMSM drive is investigated both in simulation and experiment at different operating conditions.

Method: We performed a MEDLINE search for LST following a minor head trauma related articles that were published between 1950 and June 2008. We identified 19 related studies of which 22 patient records were noted. We also added our case to this series. The information from the reports was analyzed to characterize the clinical aspects, the radiologic findings, the treatment, the Follow-up, and the management of this disease. Results: Twenty-three cases (20 pediatrics arid 3 adults) of LST following a minor head trauma have been Published including the new one presented here. The mean pediatric age in this series is 7.8 years. There were 11 cases on the right side and 8 on the left side, Male to female ratio is 1.4:1. Side arid sex were not reported in 4 and 6 cases, respectively. Sigmoid arid transverse sinuses were the most affected one. Eighty-three percent were treated by observation while the remaining 17% received anticoagulation. The Outcome was good in all patients without any notable major complications. The radiological investigation showed that there was a complete recanalization in 9 patients and a partial recanalization in 3 patients with a mean time of 8.3 weeks. Conclusion: Lateral sinus thrombosis seldomly Occurs following a minor head injury. This entity is difficult to diagnose arid one should exercise a high degree of suspicion when confronted with ail ambiguous neurological status following a closed head trauma. The most accurate imaging test according to our experience is a Multiple detector row computerized tomography (MDCT) venography completed at the time of the presentation. The indication to proceed with an MRI has to be assessed on a case-by-case basis. Anticoagulation is reserved for patients presenting a papilledema or for patients complaining of persistent headaches, vomiting, or disequilibrium. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Materials and Methods: Twelve subjects (mean age: 26.0 +/- 1.5 years) with frequent SB participated in a short-term (three blocks of 2 weeks each) randomized crossover controlled study. Both brain and muscle activities were quantified based on polygraphic and audio/video recordings made over 5 nights in a sleep laboratory, After habituation and baseline nights, 3 more nights were spent with an MAA in either a slight (25%) or pronounced (75%) mandibular protrusion position or with an MOS (control). Analysis of variance and Friedman and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were used for statistical analysis. Results: The mean number of SB episodes per hour was reduced by 39% and 47% from baseline with the MAA at a protrusion of 25% and 75%, respectively (P < .04). No difference between the two MAA positions was noted. The MOS slightly reduced the number of SB episodes per hour without reaching statistical significance (34%, P = .07). None of the SB subjects experienced any MAA breakage. Conclusion: Short-term use of an MAA is associated with a significant reduction in SB motor activity without any appliance breakage. A reinforced MAA design may be an alternative for patients with concomitant tooth grinding and snoring or apnea during sleep. Int J Prosthodont 2009;22:251-259.

Results of studies that compared the racial incidence of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) suggested that ocular pigmentation might offer protection against the development of severe ROP. The structural and functional consequences of postnatal hyperoxia (oxygen-induced retinopathy; OIR) were compared in albino Sprague-Dawley (SD) and pigmented Long-Evans (LE) rats to verify this finding. METHODS. Newborn rats were exposed to 80% O(2) during selected postnatal day intervals. The severity of the OIR was determined by examining retinal flatmounts (retinal vasculature assessment), protein level quantification and cellular localization of fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-2 and ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF; Western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry, respectively), retinal histology, and photopic and scotopic electroretinograms (ERGs). RESULTS. Irrespective of the parameter considered, structural and functional deficits resulting from postnatal hyperoxia were significantly more pronounced in LE rats. Although FGF-2 levels in LE rats had a tendency to increase after hyperoxia compared with normoxic littermates, it did not reach statistical significance. A similar finding was observed in SD rats. Of interest, however, baseline levels of FGF-2 were approximately four to five times higher in SD rats than in LE rats. There was a similar, hyperoxia-induced increase in CNTF levels between SD and LE rats. CONCLUSIONS. The findings suggest an increased susceptibility of newborn LE rats to postnatal hyperoxia in comparison with SD rats. Whether a pro-oxidant rather than antioxidant role of melanin or other genetic factors can explain these differences in oxygen susceptibility of the animal model of this retinopathy, remains to be determined.

Intersectin Regulates Dendritic Spine Development and Somatodendritic Endocytosis but Not Synaptic Vesicle Recycling in Hippocampal Neurons	JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							CLATHRIN-MEDIATED ENDOCYTOSIS; PROTEIN INTERSECTIN; DOWN-SYNDROME; DROSOPHILA AMPHIPHYSIN; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; SIGNALING PATHWAYS; NERVE-TERMINALS; ADAPTER PROTEIN; EH DOMAIN; N-WASP	Intersectin-short (intersectin-s) is a multimodule scaffolding protein functioning in constitutive and regulated forms of endocytosis in non-neuronal cells and in synaptic vesicle (SV) recycling at the neuromuscular junction of Drosophila and Caenorhabditis elegans. In vertebrates, alternative splicing generates a second isoform, intersectin-long (intersectin-1), that contains additional modular domains providing a guanine nucleotide exchange factor activity for Cdc42. In mammals, intersectin-s is expressed in multiple tissues and cells, including glia, but excluded from neurons, whereas intersectin-1 is a neuron-specific isoform. Thus, intersectin-1 may regulate multiple forms of endocytosis in mammalian neurons, including SV endocytosis. We now report, however, that intersectin-1 is localized to somatodendritic regions of cultured hippocampal neurons, with some juxtanuclear accumulation, but is excluded from synaptophysin-labeled axon terminals. Consistently, intersectin-1 knockdown (KD) does not affect SV recycling. Instead intersectin-1 co-localizes with clathrin heavy chain and adaptor protein 2 in the somatodendritic region of neurons, and its KD reduces the rate of transferrin endocytosis. The protein also co-localizes with F-actin at dendritic spines, and intersectin-1 KD disrupts spine maturation during development. Our data indicate that intersectin-1 is indeed an important regulator of constitutive endocytosis and neuronal development but that it is not a prominent player in the regulated endocytosis of SVs.

Direct evidence for central proinflammatory mechanisms in rats with experimental acute liver failure: protective effect of hypothermia	JOURNAL OF CEREBRAL BLOOD FLOW AND METABOLISM			English	Article						acute liver failure; brain edema; hepatic devascularization; hypothermia; microglial activation; proinflammatory cytokines	TUMOR-NECROSIS-FACTOR; UNCONTROLLED INTRACRANIAL HYPERTENSION; CEREBROSPINAL-FLUID LACTATE; FULMINANT HEPATIC-FAILURE; MILD HYPOTHERMIA; MODERATE HYPOTHERMIA; FACTOR-ALPHA; BRAIN EDEMA; INFLAMMATORY RESPONSE; MAGNETIC-RESONANCE	It has been proposed that proinflammatory mechanisms are involved in the pathogenesis of brain edema in acute liver failure (ALF). The aim of this study was to assess the contribution of cerebral inflammation to the neurologic complications of ALF and to assess the antiinflammatory effect of mild hypothermia. Upregulation of CD11b/c immunoreactivity, consistent with microglial activation, was observed in the brains of ALF rats at coma stages of encephalopathy. Interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) mRNAs were increased two to threefold in the brains of ALF rats compared with that in sham-operated controls. The magnitude of increased expression of proinflammatory cytokines in the brain was correlated with the progression of encephalopathy and the onset of brain edema. Significant increases in IL-1 beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha levels were also found in the sera and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of these animals. Mild hypothermia delayed the onset of encephalopathy, prevented brain edema, and concomitantly attenuated plasma, brain, and CSF proinflammatory cytokines. These results show that experimental ALF leads to increases in brain production of proinflammatory cytokines, and afford the first direct evidence that central inflammatory mechanisms play a role in the pathogenesis of the cerebral complications of ALF. Antiinflammatory agents could be beneficial in the management of these complications.

However, it is unknown whether the vascular and metabolic responses within a given brain area differ when local neuronal activity is evoked by an activity in the distinct neuronal networks. In this study we assessed, for the first time, the differences in neuronal responses and changes in CBF and oxygen consumption that are evoked after the activation of two different inputs to a single cortical area. We show that, for a given level of glutamatergic synaptic activity, corticocortical and thalamocortical inputs evoked activity in pyramidal cells and different classes of interneurons, and produced different changes in oxygen consumption and CBF. Furthermore, increases in stimulation intensities either turned off or activated additional classes of inhibitory interneurons immunoreactive for different vasoactive molecules, which may contribute to increases in CBF. Our data imply that for a given cortical area, the amplitude of vascular signals will depend critically on the type of input, and that a positive blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal may be a consequence of the activation of both pyramidal cells and inhibitory interneurons.

Differential errors in recalled phone use are a major concern in such studies. INTERPHONE, a multinational case-control study of brain tumour risk and mobile phone use, included validation studies to quantify such errors and evaluate the potential for recall bias. Mobile phone records of 212 cases and 296 controls were collected from network operators in three INTERPHONE countries over an average of 2 years, and compared with mobile phone use reported at interview. The ratio of reported to recorded phone use was analysed as measure of agreement. Mean ratios were virtually the same for cases and controls: both underestimated number of calls by a factor of 0.81 and overestimated call duration by a factor of 1.4. For cases, but not controls, ratios increased with increasing time before the interview; however, these trends were based on few subjects with long-term data. Ratios increased by level of use. Random recall errors were large. In conclusion, there was little evidence for differential recall errors overall or in recent time periods. However, apparent overestimation by cases in more distant time periods could cause positive bias in estimates of disease risk associated with mobile phone use.

GABA-B-1 Receptors are Coupled to the ERK1/2 MAP Kinase Pathway in the Absence of GABA-B-2 Subunits	JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						GABA-B-1; MAPK pathway; Dimerisation; Translational control	METABOTROPIC GLUTAMATE RECEPTORS; FUNCTIONAL GABA(B) RECEPTOR; AMINOBUTYRIC-ACID RECEPTOR; SENSORY NEURONS; MESSENGER-RNA; B-RECEPTOR; PROTEIN; BRAIN; TRAFFICKING; CELLS	In the current model of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) B receptor function, there is a requirement for GABA-B-1/2 heterodimerisation for targetting to the cell surface. However, different lines of evidence suggest that the GABA-B-1 subunit can form a functional receptor in the absence of GABA-B-2. We observed coupling of endogenous GABA-B-1 receptors in the DI-TNC1 glial cell line to the ERK pathway in response to baclofen even though these cells do not express GABA-B-2. GABA-B-1A receptors were also able to mediate a rapid, transient, and dose-dependent activation of the ERK1/2 MAP kinase pathway when transfected alone into HEK 293 cells. The response was abolished by G(i/o) and MEK inhibition, potentiated by inhibitors of phospholipase C and protein kinase C and did not involve PI-3-kinase activity. Finally, using bioluminescence resonance energy transfer and co-immunoprecipitation, we show the existence of homodimeric GABA-B-1A receptors in transfected HEK293 cells. Altogether, our observations show that GABA-B-1A receptors are able to activate the ERK1/2 pathway despite the absence of surface targetting partner GABA-B-2 in both HEK 293 cells and the DI-TNC1 cell line.

Cells were incubated 3 and 24 h with 5 mM ammonia in the presence or absence of the glutamine synthetase inhibitor methionine sulfoximine. An increase of de novo synthesized fatty acids and the glycerol subunit of lipids was observed after 3 h treatment with ammonia (35% and 40% over control, respectively), the initial time point examined. Both parameters further increased significantly to 85% and 60% over control after 24 h ammonia treatment. Three hours incubation with ammonia increased the synthesis of diacylglycerides, while formation of triacylglycerides was decreased (40% over and 15% under control, respectively). The degradation of fatty acids was not affected by ammonia treatment. Furthermore, ammonia caused alterations in the composition of fatty acids, e.g. increased mono- and decreased polyunsaturated fatty acids (85% over and 15% under control concentrations, respectively). The decrease of polyunsaturated fatty acids was even more pronounced in isolated astrocytic mitochondria (39% lower than controls). Our results suggest ammonia-induced abnormalities in astrocytic membranes, which may be related to astrocytic mitochondrial dysfunction in hyperammonemic states. Most of the observed effects of ammonia on fatty acid synthesis and composition were ameliorated when glutamine synthetase was inhibited by methionine sulfoximine, supporting a pathological role of glutamine in ammonia toxicity. This study further emphasizes the importance of investigating the relative contribution of exogenous ammonia, effects of glutamine and of glutamine-derived ammonia on astrocytes and astrocytic mitochondria.

We previously demonstrated that heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) is up-regulated in AD and PD brain and promotes the accumulation of non-transferrin iron in astroglial mitochondria. Herein, dynamic secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) and other techniques were employed to ascertain (i) the impact of HO-1 over-expression on astroglial mitochondrial morphology in vitro, (ii) the topography of aberrant iron sequestration in astrocytes over-expressing HO-1, and (iii) the role of iron regulatory proteins (IRP) in HO-1-mediated iron deposition. Astroglial hHO-1 over-expression induced cytoplasmic vacuolation, mitochondrial membrane damage, and macroautophagy. HO-1 promoted trapping of redox-active iron and sulfur within many cytopathological profiles without impacting ferroportin, transferrin receptor, ferritin, and IRP2 protein levels or IRP1 activity. Thus, HO-1 activity promotes mitochondrial macroautophagy and sequestration of redox-active iron in astroglia independently of classical iron mobilization pathways. Glial HO-1 may be a rational therapeutic target in AD, PD, and other human CNS conditions characterized by the unregulated deposition of brain iron.

The atypical protein kinase C in Aplysia can form a protein kinase M by cleavage	JOURNAL OF NEUROCHEMISTRY			English	Article						Aplysia; atypical PKCs; calpain; learning and memory; protein kinase C; protein kinase M	LONG-TERM POTENTIATION; RAPAMYCIN-SENSITIVE MANNER; M-ZETA SYNTHESIS; MOLECULAR-MECHANISMS; SENSORY NEURONS; HETEROSYNAPTIC FACILITATION; SYNAPTIC FACILITATION; ISOFORM SPECIFICITY; MEMORY STORAGE; PI 3-KINASE	In vertebrates, a brain-specific transcript from the atypical protein kinase C (PKC) zeta gene encodes protein kinase M (PKM) zeta, a constitutively active kinase implicated in the maintenance of synaptic plasticity and memory. We have cloned the atypical PKC from Aplysia, PKC Apl III. We did not find a transcript in Aplysia encoding PKM zeta, and evolutionary analysis of atypical PKCs suggests formation of this transcript is restricted to vertebrates. Instead, over-expression of PKC Apl III in Aplysia sensory neurons leads to production of a PKM fragment of PKC Apl III. This cleavage was induced by calcium and blocked by calpain inhibitors. Moreover, nervous system enriched spliced forms of PKC Apl III show enhanced cleavage. PKC Apl III could also be activated through phosphorylation downstream of phosphoinositide 3-kinase. We suggest that PKM forms of atypical PKCs play a conserved role in memory formation, but the mechanism of formation of these kinases has changed over evolution.

The consequences of the accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau in the somatodendritic compartment remain poorly characterized at the early stage of disease before the formation of tau insoluble filaments. We investigated the Ultrastructural changes induced by this accumulation in the neuronal soma of motor neurons in asymptomatic JNPL3 mice that overexpress mutant tau, P301L. More numerous contacts between rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) membranes and mitochondria were observed in JNLP3 mice compared with wild-type mice. This correlated with a preferential increase of the amount of tau at the surface of RER membranes but not at the surface of mitochondria, as revealed by tau immunogold labeling. Using a subcellular fractionation procedure, all increased amount of phosphorylated tau was identified in the rough microsome subfraction, wherein the RER marker, ribophorin, was enriched. A similar increase was noted in the rough microsome subfraction isolated from Alzheimer disease brains. The association of hyperphosphorylated tau with ER membranes was confirmed by double immunogold labeling of the subtraction enriched in ER membranes isolated from Alzheimer disease brains. These results Suggest that more contacts between RER membranes and mitochondria resulting from the accumulation of tau at the surface of RER membranes might contribute to tau-induced neurodegeneration.

Within the spinal cord, the vast network of excitatory and inhibitory interneurons must be functionally reconfigured on an ongoing basis during locomotion to adapt to the environment and meet particular demands of the task. It is clear that different rhythmic motor behaviors are generated by shared and specialized circuitry and that reconfiguration is governed by multiple inputs that dynamically interact at the spinal level.

First published February 18, 2009; doi:10.1152/jn.91121.2008. The neuronal mechanisms that contribute to tactile perception were studied using single-unit recordings from the cutaneous hand representation of primate primary (S1) and secondary (S2) somatosensory cortex. This study followed up on our recent observation that S1 and S2 neurons developed a sustained change in discharge during the instruction period of a directed-attention task. We determined the extent to which the symbolic light cues, which signaled the modality (tactile, visual) to attend and discriminate, elicited changes in discharge rate during the instructed delay (ID) period of the attention task and the functional importance of this discharge. ID responses, consisting of a sustained increase or decrease in discharge during the 2-s instruction period, were present in about 40% of the neurons in S1 and S2. ID responses in both cortical regions were very similar in most respects (frequency, sign, latency, amplitude), suggesting a common source. A major difference, however, was related to attentional modulation during the ID period: attentional influences were almost entirely restricted to S2 and these effects were always superimposed on the ID response (additive effect). These findings suggest that the underlying mechanisms for ID discharge and attention are independent. ID discharge significantly modified the initial response to the standard stimuli (competing texture and visual stimuli), usually enhancing responsiveness. We also showed that tactile detection in humans is enhanced during the ID period. Together, the results suggest that ID discharge represents a priming mechanism that prepares cortical areas to receive and process sensory inputs.	[Meftah, El-Mehdi; Bourgeon, Stephanie; Chapman, C.

To report the case of a 49-year-old woman with lifelong PGAD who was recently prescribed varenicline for smoking cessation and who subsequently experienced amelioration of PGAD symptoms. Patient self-report and literature review. Written consent was obtained from the patient. Abatement of lifelong PGAD symptoms occurred within approximately two weeks each time varenicline treatment was initiated. PGAD symptoms returned in approximately 2 weeks each time treatment was suspended. Varenicline is a partial agonist of the alpha 2 beta 4 subtype of nicotinic cholinergic receptor. Its unique pharmacological action stimulates a small amount of brain dopamine release while antagonizing the ability of nicotine to stimulate much larger dopamine release. Genital sexual arousal is controlled in part by the action of hypothalamic and limbic dopamine systems. Based on the mechanism of action of varenicline and the observation of its effectiveness in this case, we hypothesize that: (i) central hyperactive dopamine release is an important component in the pathophysiology of PGAD in this patient; and (ii) use of varenicline resulted in lowering of this hyperstimulated central dopamine release. Objective testing of varenicline's safety and efficacy in the treatment of other women with PGAD is suggested. Korda JB, Pfaus JG, and Goldstein I.

Patients with neurological disease often make rule violation (RV) errors, but the anatomical basis for RV during cognitive testing remains debated. The present study examined the neuroanatomical correlates of RV errors made on tests of executive functioning in 166 subjects diagnosed with neurodegenerative disease or as neurologically healthy. Specifically, RV errors were voxel-wisely cot-related with gray matter volume derived from high-definition magnetic resonance images using voxel-based morphometry implemented in SPM2. Latent variable analysis showed that RV errors tapped a unitary construct separate from repetition errors. This analysis was used to generate factor scores to represent what is common among RV errors across tests. The extracted RV factor scores correlated With tissue loss in the lateral middle and inferior frontal gyri and the caudate nucleus bilaterally. When a more stringent control for global cognitive functioning was applied using Mini Mental State Exam scores, only the correlations with the right lateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) remained significant. These data underscore the importance of right lateral PFC in behavioral monitoring and highlight the potential of RV error assessment for identifying patients with damage to this region.

Yet, equivalence in construct measurement across groups cannot be assumed. To address this issue, we examined data from the Canadian Study of Health and Aging, a large study of older adults. We tested the hypothesis that the latent variables underlying the neuropsychological battery administered in French or English were the same (invariant). The best-fitting, baseline model. established in the English-speaking Exploratory sample (n = 716), replicated well in the English-speaking Validation sample (n = 715), and the French-speaking sample (IFS, n = 446). Across the English- and FSs, two of the factors, Long-term Retrieval and Visuospatial speed, displayed invariance, that is, reflected the same constructs measured in the same scales. In contrast, the Verbal Ability factor showed only partial invariance. reflecting 41 differences in the relative difficulty Of Some tests Of language functions. This empirical demonstration of partial measurement invariance lends Support to the Continued use of these translated measures in clinical and research contexts and illustrates a framework for detailed evaluation of the generality of models of cognition and psychopathology, across groups of any sort.

At alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) iGluRs, full and partial agonists close the agonist-binding domain (ABD) to different degrees whereas agonist-induced domain closure is apparently fixed at N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors. Although kainate (KA) iGluRs are thought to behave like AMPA receptors, the issue has not been formally tested because of the paucity of available receptor agonists. Here we identify a series of structurally related full and partial agonists at GluK2 (formerly GluR6) KARs and predict their docking mode using the in silico ligand-docking program FITTED. As expected, the neurotransmitter L-Glu behaved as a full agonist but modest reduction (e. g., L-serine or L-aspartate) or elongation (e. g., L-alpha-aminoadipate) in chain length generated weak partial agonists. It is noteworthy that in silico ligand-docking predicted that most partial agonists select for the closed and not, as expected, the open or intermediate conformations of the GluK2 ABD. Experiments using concanavalin-A to directly report conformations in the intact GluK2 receptor support this prediction with the full agonist, L-Glu, indistinguishable in this regard from weak partial agonists, D-and L-Asp. Exceptions to this were KA and domoate, which failed to elicit full closure as a result of steric hindrance by a key tyrosine residue. Our data suggest that alternative structural models need to be considered to describe agonist behavior at KARs. Finally, our study identifies the responsiveness to several neurotransmitter candidates establishing the possibility that endogenous amino acids other than L-Glu may regulate native KARs at central synapses.

Management of agitation and aggression associated with Alzheimer disease	NATURE REVIEWS NEUROLOGY			English	Review							PLACEBO-CONTROLLED TRIAL; DOUBLE-BLIND; NEUROPSYCHIATRIC SYMPTOMS; BEHAVIORAL SYMPTOMS; RANDOMIZED-TRIAL; NURSING-HOME; PSYCHOLOGICAL SYMPTOMS; INSTITUTIONALIZED PATIENTS; CHOLINESTERASE-INHIBITORS; ANTIPSYCHOTIC-DRUGS	Agitation and aggression are frequently occurring and distressing behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD). These symptoms are disturbing for individuals with Alzheimer disease, commonly confer risk to the patient and others, and present a major management challenge for clinicians. The most widely prescribed pharmacological treatments for these symptoms-atypical antipsychotics-have a modest but significant beneficial effect in the short-term treatment (over 6-12 weeks) of aggression but limited benefits in longer term therapy. Benefits are less well established for other symptoms of agitation. in addition, concerns are growing over the potential for serious adverse outcomes with these treatments, including stroke and death. A detailed consideration of other pharmacological and nonpharmacological approaches to agitation and aggression in patients with Alzheimer disease is, therefore, imperative. This article reviews the increasing evidence in support of psychological interventions or alternative therapies (such as aromatherapy) as a first-line management strategy for agitation, as well as the potential pharmacological alternatives to atypical antipsychotics-preliminary evidence for memantine, carbamazepine, and citalopram is encouraging.

The drugs used for the treatment of these disorders generally act through and/or on the serotonergic system. Different animal models of depression have provided researchers with tools to obtain a better understanding of drug actions and possibilities to obtain insight into the neurochemical bases of these disorders. The measurements of the 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B receptor densities in a rat model of depression, Flinders sensitive line (FSL) rats, and comparisons with Sprague-Dawley (SPD) and Flinders resistant line (FRL) rats, are reported here. The receptor sites were quantified by autoradiography in more than 25 distinct brain regions known to have relatively large densities of respective sites. Some brain regions (e.g., dental gyrus, septal nucleus) were divided into several parts, according to previously known subdivisions, because of a substantial heterogeneity of these receptors. The densities in the FSL rats ("depressed" rats) were compared statistically to those in the SPD rats. In addition, comparisons were made to the densities in the FRL rats (rats not showing depressive symptoms). Comparisons were performed with the SPD and FRL rats because both of these strains have been used as control animals in studies of FSL rats. The results show that the densities of 5-HT1A receptors are not significantly different between the FSL and SPD rats, but they are significantly different from the FRL rats. 5-HT1A receptor density is significantly higher in the FRL rats than the SPD rats. The 5-HT1B, receptors were significantly greater in the FSL rats than in either the SPD or FRL rats. In addition, the FRL rats have 5-HT1B receptor densities significantly lower in many brain regions than the SPD rats. The data presented here, in addition to previously reported differences in regional synthesis between these strains and the effect of acute citalopram on synthesis, suggest that SPD rats are likely a more appropriate control than FRL rats, when studies of FSL rats are performed with drugs acting directly or indirectly on, or through, the brain serotonergic system. However, comparisons, particularly of neurochemical and/or biological parameters in FRL rats. may reveal new insight into the alterations of 5-HT neurotransmission in this animal model of depression and possibly human depression. as well as the elevation of symptoms with treatments. The data also suggest that there could be a different fraction of 5-HT1A receptors in high and low affinity states in these strains, as well as the possibility of different intracellular signalling.

Sprague-Dawley (SPD) rats were used as the controls, and Flinders Resistant Line (FRL) rats were used as auxiliary controls, to hopefully obtain a better understanding of the effects of citalopram on Flinders Sensitive Line (FSL; "depressed") rats. Regional 5-HT synthesis was evaluated using a radiographic method with a labelled tryptophan analog tracer. In each strain of rats, the animals were treated with citalopram (10 mg/(kg day)) or saline for 14 days. The groups consisted of between fourteen and twenty rats. There were six groups of rats with citalopram (CIT) and saline (SAL) groups in each of the strains (SPD-SAL, SPD-CIT, FRL-SAL, FRL-CIT, FSL-SAL and FSL-CIT). A two-factor analysis of variance was used to evaluate the effect of the treatment c., SPD-SAL relative to SPD-CIT) followed by planned comparisons to evaluate the effect in each brain region. In addition, the planned comparison with appropriate contrast was used to evaluate a relative effects in SPD relative to FSL and FRL, and FSL relative to FRL groups. A statistical analysis was first performed in the a priori selected regions, because we had learned, from previous work, that it was possible to select the brain regions in which neurochemical variables had been altered by the disorder and subsequent antidepressant treatments. The results clearly show that citalopram treatment does not have an overall effect on synthesis in the control SPD rats; there was no significant (p > 0.05) difference between the SPD-SAL and SPD-CIT rats. In "depressed" FSL rats, citalopram produced a significant (p < 0.05) elevation of synthesis in seventeen out of thirty-four regions, with a significant (p < 0.05) reduction in the dorsal and median raphe. In the FRIL rats, there was a significant (p < 0.05) elevation in the synthesis in twenty-two out of thirty-four brain regions, with a reduction in the dorsal raphe. In addition to these regions magnus raphe was different in the SPD and FSL groups, but it was on the statistical grounds identified as an outlier. There were significant changes produced in the FSL and FRL rats in thirteen out of seventeen a priori selected brain regions, while in the SPD rats. citalopram produced significant changes in only four out of seventeen a priori selected regions. The statistical evaluation also revealed that changes produced by citalopram in the FSL and FRL rats were significantly greater than those in the SPD rats and that there was no significant difference between the effect produced in the FSL and FRL rats. The presented results suggest that in "depressed" FSL rats, the antidepressant citalopram elevates 5-HT synthesis, which probably in part relates to the reported improved in behaviour with citalopram.

Sex differences in the growth of white matter during adolescence	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							ADULT HUMAN BRAIN; CORPUS-CALLOSUM; MAGNETIZATION-TRANSFER; MORPHOMETRIC ANALYSIS; IN-VIVO; MRI; DIMORPHISM; CHILDHOOD; ARCHITECTURE; EXPRESSION	The purpose of this study was to examine sex differences in the maturation of white matter during adolescence ( 12 to 18 years of age). We measured lobular volumes of white matter and white-matter "density" throughout the brain using T1-weighted images, and estimated the myelination index using magnetisation-transfer ratio (MTR). In male adolescents, we observed age-related increases in white-matter lobular volumes accompanied by decreases in the lobular values of white-matter MTR. White-matter density in the putative cortico-spinal tract (pCST) decreased with age. In female adolescents, on the other hand, we found only small age-related increase in white-matter volumes and no age-related changes in white-matter MTR, with the exception of the frontal lobe where MTR increased. White-matter density in the pCST also increased with age. These results suggest that sex-specific mechanisms may underlie the growth of white matter during adolescence. We speculate that these mechanisms involve primarily age-related increases in axonal calibre in males and increased myelination in females. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	[Perrin, J.

Lately, BOLD changes occurring before the spike were found in patients with generalized epilepsy. The study of metabolic changes preceding spikes might improve our knowledge of spike generation. We tested this hypothesis in patients with idiopathic and symptomatic focal epilepsy. Eleven consecutive patients were recorded at 3 T: five with idiopathic focal and 6 with symptomatic focal epilepsy. Thirteen spike types were analyzed separately. Statistical analysis was performed using the timing of spikes as events, modeled with HRFs peaking between -9 s and +9 s around the spike. HRFs were calculated the most focal BOLD response. Eleven of the thirteen studies showed prespike BOLD responses. Prespike responses were more focal than postspike responses. Three studies showed early positive followed by later negative BOLD responses in the spike field. Three had early positive BOLD responses in the spike field, which remained visible in the later maps. Three others had positive BOLD responses in the spike field, later propagating to surrounding areas. HRFs peaked between -5 and +6 s around the spike timing. No significant EEG changes could be identified prior to the spike. BOLD changes prior to the spike frequently occur in focal epilepsies. They are more focal than later BOLD changes and strongly related to the spike field. Early changes may result from increased neuronal activity in the spike field prior to the EEG spike and reflect an event more localized than the spike itself. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

This conviction stems from both neurophysiological studies in the behaving monkey and from the analysis of the consequences of parietal lobe lesions in humans. Despite an extensive literature concerning varying aspects of the composition and control of eye and hand movements, there is little information about the physiological processes responsible for encoding target distance and hand movement in depth or about their control and impairment in parietal patients. This review is an attempt to provide a comprehensive picture from the fragmentary material existing on this issue in the literature. This should serve as a basis for discussion of what we consider to be a prototypical function of the dorsal visuomotor stream in the primate brain, that of encoding eye and hand movement in depth.

A.			Role of rat sensory neuron-specific receptor (rSNSR1) in inflammatory pain: Contribution of TRPV1 to SNSR signaling in the pain pathway	PAIN			English	Article						Dorsal root ganglia; GPCR; Heat hyperalgesia	SMALL INTERFERING RNA; SPINAL-CORD; VANILLOID RECEPTOR-1; NEUROPATHIC PAIN; HYPERALGESIA; ACTIVATION; FAMILY; POTENTIATION; INVOLVEMENT; NOCICEPTION	Sensory neuron-specific receptors (SNSRs) belong to a large family of GPCRs, known as Mrgs (Mas-related genes), many of which are preferentially expressed in primary afferent nociceptors. Selective SNSR agonists produce pain-like behaviors in rats, showing that SNSR activation is sufficient to produce pain. However, it is unknown whether SNSR activation is necessary for pain either in the normal condition or in pathological pain states. Here we used small interfering RNA (siRNA) to acutely knockdown rat SNSR1 and test the hypothesis that this receptor mediates pain responses. Administration of siRNA to the lumbar spinal cord in rats dose-dependently knocked down rSNSR1 mRNA and protein and abolished heat hyperalgesia evoked by intradermal administration of specific rSNSR1 agonists. In rats with levels of rSNSR1 knockdown sufficient to block responses to the SNSR1 agonists, there was no effect on normal pain responses, but there was a significant reduction of heat hyperalgesia in an inflammatory pain model (Complete Freund's Adjuvant), Supporting a role for rSNSR1 in inflammatory pain. Further in Vivo studies revealed that SNSR1 knockdown had no effect on responses to intradermal capsaicin, a selective TRPV1 agonist. In contrast, a selective TRPV1 antagonist abolished heat hyperalgesia produced by an SNSR agonist, suggesting that TRPV1 receptors Mediate rSNSR1-evoked responses. We also found that rSNSR1-like immunoreactivity, like TRPV1, is localized in the superficial dorsal horn of the spinal cord. We propose that rSNSR1 represents a new member of the receptors expressed on chemosensitive nociceptors responsible for detecting the "inflammatory soup" of mediators generated by tissue damage.

J	Thomson, S; Jacques, L				Thomson, Simon; Jacques, Line			Demographic Characteristics of Patients with Severe Neuropathic Pain Secondary to Failed Back Surgery Syndrome	PAIN PRACTICE			English	Article						patient characteristics; failed back surgery syndrome; neuropathic pain; quality of life; treatment pathway		Background: Neuropathic pain commonly affects the back and legs and is associated with severe disability and psychological illness. It is unclear how patients with predominantly neuropathic pain due to failed back surgery syndrome (FBSS) compare with patients with other chronic pain conditions. Aims: To present data on characteristics associated with FBSS patients compared with those with complex regional pain syndrome, rheumatoid and osteoarthritis, and fibromyalgia. Methods: The PROCESS (Prospective Randomized Controlled Multicenter Trial of the Effectiveness of Spinal Cord Stimulation, ISRCTN 77527324) trial randomized 100 patients to spinal cord stimulation (n = 52) plus conventional medical management (CMM) or CMM alone (n = 48). Baseline patient parameters included age, sex, time since last surgery, employment status, pain location and severity (visual analogue scale), health-related quality of life (HRQoL), level of disability, medication, and nondrug therapies. Reference population data was drawn from the literature. Results: At baseline, patients in the PROCESS study had a similar age and gender profile compared with other conditions. PROCESS patients suffered from greater leg pain and had lower HRQoL. PROCESS patients treatment cost was higher and they commonly took opioids, while antidepressants and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were more often used for other conditions. Prior to baseline, 87% of patients had tried at least 4 different treatment modalities. Conclusions: Patients suffering from chronic pain of neuropathic origin following FBSS often fail to obtain adequate relief with conventional therapies (eg, medication, nondrug therapies) and suffer greater pain and lower HRQoL compared with patients with other chronic pain conditions. Neuropathic FBSS patients may require alternative and possibly more (cost-) effective treatments, which should be considered earlier in their therapeutic management.

REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE PSIQUIATRIA			English	Article						Depression; Transcranial direct current stimulation; Brain; Mental disorders; Review literature as topic	NONINVASIVE BRAIN-STIMULATION; MOTOR CORTEX; DC STIMULATION; POLARIZATION; HUMANS; SAFETY; TDCS	Objective: In recent years, a number of new somatic (non-pharmacological treatments) have been developed for the treatment of major depression and other neuropsychiatric disorders. Among these, one of the most promising is transcranial direct current stimulation. Method: For the present literature review we searched the PubMed between January 1985 and February 2009. To be included, articles should have been published in English and should address general principles of transcranial direct current stimulation and its use in major depression. Discussion: Current protocols for the treatment of major depression with transcranial direct current stimulation usually involve the application of two sponge-electrodes in the scalp. In general, the positive electrode is applied in the region above the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (i.e., F3 region of the 10/20 International System for EEG) and the negative electrode is applied in the region above the right supra-orbital area. A direct electrical current of 1-2 mA is then applied between the electrodes for about 20 minutes, with sessions being daily performed for one to two weeks. Initial studies (including a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial) showed that transcranial direct current stimulation is effective for the treatment of non-complicated major depression and that this technique, when used in depressed patients, is associated with improvement in cognitive performance (including working memory). Finally, transcranial direct current stimulation is safe and well tolerated. Conclusion: Recent studies show that transcranial direct current stimulation is an important neuromodulatory method that may be useful for the treatment of depressed patients. However, further studies are needed to better clarify its precise role in the management of depressive disorders.

Paraplegia after chest wall resection for primitive neuroectodermal tumor	SEMINARS IN PEDIATRIC SURGERY			English	Article						Primitive neuroectodermal tumor; Paraplegia; Chest wall resection	THORACOTOMY	Spinal cord complications are rarely encountered in elective pediatric surgery. We present a patient who became paraplegic after resection of a chest wall tumor. After neoadjuvant radio- and chemotherapy, a 10-year-old girl with primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET) of the right chest underwent a right chest wall resection. Ribs #3, 4, 5, and 6 were resected en masse with a Pulmonary wedge resection of right upper and middle lobes. To obtain clear margins, the ribs were disarticulated from the vertebral column. Significant bleeding arose when the fourth rib was detached. Presuming an intercostal vessel bleed, the area was packed with surgicel with resolution of the bleeding. The patient was kept sedated and ventilated in the PICU. The next day, she complained of paresis of her lower extremities. MRI revealed compression of the spinal cord at the T4 level. Emergency decompression and laminectomy was performed. Blood clot and surgicel were found in the area of the spinal canal. Giant epidural veins were encountered as well, again with massive bleeding. The patient never regained neurological function below the insult to the cord. Despite negative margins and ongoing chemo- and radiotherapy, her tumor recurred and she died to her disease less than I year later. Chest wall tumors arising near the spinal canal may be associated with enlarged Batson's plexus that may hemorrhage during Surgical resection. We recommend immediate imaging or prophylactic laminectomy for any concerns of spinal hemorrhage. Patients should also receive regular assessment of neurovitals, despite issues of pain control and sedation. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Glial cells have been proposed to participate in excitotoxic neuronal loss, but their precise role is defined poorly. In this in vivo study, we show that NMDA induces profound nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B) activation in Muller glia but not in retinal neurons. Intriguingly, NMDA-induced death of retinal neurons is effectively blocked by inhibitors of NF-kappa B activity. We demonstrate that tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) protein produced in Muller glial cells via an NMDA-induced NF-kappa B-dependent pathway plays a crucial role in excitotoxic loss of retinal neurons. This cell loss occurs mainly through a TNF alpha-dependent increase in Ca(2+)-permeable AMPA receptors on susceptible neurons. Thus, our data reveal a novel non-cell-autonomous mechanism by which glial cells can profoundly exacerbate neuronal death following excitotoxic injury.

Although the latter process is manifested as increases in synaptic efficacy which require new protein synthesis in pyramidal neurons, it is unknown whether such enduring plasticity occurs in interneurons. Here, we uncover a long-term potentiation (LTP) of transmission at individual interneuron excitatory synapses which persists for at least 24 h, after repetitive activation of type-1 metabotropic glutamate receptors [mGluR1-mediated chemical late LTP (cL-LTP(mGluR1))]. cL-LTP(mGluR1) involves presynaptic and postsynaptic expression mechanisms and requires both transcription and translation via phosphoinositide 3-kinase/mammalian target of rapamycin and MAP kinase kinase-extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase signaling pathways. Moreover, cL-LTP(mGluR1) involves translational control at the level of initiation as it is prevented by hippuristanol, an inhibitor of eIF4A, and facilitated in mice lacking the cap-dependent translational repressor, 4E-BP. Our results reveal novel mechanisms of long-term synaptic plasticity that are transcription and translation-dependent in inhibitory interneurons, indicating that persistent synaptic modifications in interneuron circuits may contribute to hippocampal-dependent cognitive processes.

We investigated the in vivo function of Src family kinases (SFKs) as growth cone guidance signaling intermediates in the context of spinal lateral motor column (LMC) motor axon projection toward the ventral or dorsal limb mesenchyme. Using in situ mRNA detection we determined that Src and Fyn are expressed in LMC motor neurons of chick and mouse embryos at the time of limb trajectory selection. Inhibition of SFK activity by C-terminal Src kinase (Csk) overexpression in chick LMC axons using in ovo electroporation resulted in LMC axons selecting the inappropriate dorsoventral trajectory within the limb mesenchyme, with medial LMC axon projecting into the dorsal and ventral limb nerve with apparently random incidence. We also detected LMC axon trajectory choice errors in Src mutant mice demonstrating a nonredundant role for Src in motor axon guidance in agreement with gain and loss of Src function in chick LMC neurons which led to the redirection of LMC axons. Finally, Csk-mediated SFK inhibition attenuated the retargeting of LMC axons caused by EphA or EphB over-expression, implying the participation of SFKs in Eph-mediated LMC motor axon guidance. In summary, our findings demonstrate that SFKs are essential for motor axon guidance and suggest that they play an important role in relaying ephrin: Eph signals that mediate the selection of motor axon trajectory in the limb.

Role of Protein Kinase C in the Induction and Maintenance of Serotonin-Dependent Enhancement of the Glutamate Response in Isolated Siphon Motor Neurons of Aplysia californica	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							INTERMEDIATE-TERM FACILITATION; POSTSYNAPTIC AMPA RECEPTORS; SYNAPTIC FACILITATION; M-ZETA; SENSORY NEURONS; HETEROSYNAPTIC FACILITATION; BEHAVIORAL SENSITIZATION; PERSISTENT ACTIVATION; ISOFORM SPECIFICITY; NERVOUS-SYSTEM	Serotonin (5-HT) mediates learning-related facilitation of sensorimotor synapses in Aplysia californica. Under some circumstances 5-HT-dependent facilitation requires the activity of protein kinase C (PKC). One critical site of PKC's contribution to 5-HT-dependent synaptic facilitation is the presynaptic sensory neuron. Here, we provide evidence that postsynaptic PKC also contributes to synaptic facilitation. We investigated the contribution of PKC to enhancement of the glutamate-evoked potential (Glu-EP) in isolated siphon motor neurons in cell culture. A 10 min application of either 5-HT or phorbol ester, which activates PKC, produced persistent (> 50 min) enhancement of the Glu-EP. Chelerythrine and bisindolylmaleimide-1 (Bis), two inhibitors of PKC, both blocked the induction of 5-HT-dependent enhancement. An inhibitor of calpain, a calcium-dependent protease, also blocked 5-HT's effect. Interestingly, whereas chelerythrine blocked maintenance of the enhancement, Bis did not. Because Bis has greater selectivity for conventional and novel isoforms of PKC than for atypical isoforms, this result implicates an atypical isoform in the maintenance of 5-HT's effect. Although induction of enhancement of the Glu-EP requires protein synthesis (Villareal et al., 2007), we found that maintenance of the enhancement does not. Maintenance of 5-HT-dependent enhancement appears to be mediated by a PKM-type fragment generated by calpain-dependent proteolysis of atypical PKC. Together, our results suggest that 5-HT treatment triggers two phases of PKC activity within the motor neuron, an early phase that may involve conventional, novel or atypical isoforms of PKC, and a later phase that selectively involves an atypical isoform.

The tactile stimuli consisted of either static dots, dots moving coherently in one of two possible directions, or in random directions. Although CB and sighted controls performed equally well on the motion discrimination task, only CB showed increased activation in the right middle temporal area. In addition, CB also activated other visual areas including the cuneus and extrastriate area V3. These results indicate that the dorsal visual pathway is activated by tactile motion stimuli in CB, therefore providing additional support for the cross-modal plasticity hypothesis.

To investigate the role of the NPY Y5 receptor during lactation, an antisense oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) targeted to the NPY Y5 receptor, an equivalent scrambled ODN or vehicle. was chronically infused into the 3rd ventricle of lactating rats from day 8 postpartum. Y5 antisense ODN treatment reduced Y5 positive cell number in the paraventricular nucleus and resulted in significant reductions in food intake and litter growth. Litters from pair-fed vehicle treated dams gained significantly more weight than the litters of Y5 antisense ODN treated dams suggesting that decreased maternal food intake is not the only mechanism involved in suppressing litter weight gain. When mother-litter interaction was examined on day 13 pp, Y5 antisense ODN treated dams spent significantly less time on the nest and had significantly shorter nest bouts. These results suggest that in addition to regulating feeding behaviour, the Y5 receptor subtype may have previously unrecognised roles in the control of nesting behaviour during lactation with subsequent effects on litter growth rates.

Several electrophysiological and anatomical lines of evidence support plasticity caudal to the lesion site, but do not provide sufficient clues about neuronal and vascular reorganization after SCI. The aim of the present study was to compare neuronal activation in the lumbar spinal cord between uninjured and SCI rats with novel optical imaging technology. The results showed significant haemodynamic response differences after sciatic nerve stimulation in uninjured controls, in comparison to SCI rats. Both timing and shape of the response were modified. In uninjured rats, blood flow presented an initial dip but was rapidly drained from the activation site through the venous system. In comparison, the blood transfer rate in SCI rats was much slower. Damaged blood vessels at the lesion site after thoracic SCI impacted the vascular response upon neuronal activation in the lumbar spinal cord. This observation is important in the study of spinal cord function after SCI by imaging techniques based on haemodynamics (blood oxygenation level-dependent using functional magnetic resonance imaging (BOLD fMRI) and optical imaging). In conclusion, our results indicate that new avenues quantifying the influence of vascular plumbing will have to be developed to explore the efficacy of rehabilitation and pharmacological therapies by haemodynamic imaging.

CDF Collaboration	Measurement of the Top-Quark Mass with Dilepton Events Selected Using Neuroevolution at CDF	PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS			English	Article							NEURAL-NETWORKS; FERMILAB; COLLISIONS; TEVATRON; TEV	We report a measurement of the top-quark mass M(t) in the dilepton decay channel tt -> bl('+)nu(')(l)b1 nu(l). Events are selected with a neural network which has been directly optimized for statistical precision in top-quark mass using neuroevolution, a technique modeled on biological evolution. The top-quark mass is extracted from per-event probability densities that are formed by the convolution of leading order matrix elements and detector resolution functions. The joint probability is the product of the probability densities from 344 candidate events in 2.0 fb(-1) of pp collisions collected with the CDF II detector, yielding a measurement of M(t)=171.2 +/- 2.7(stat)+/- 2.9(syst) GeV/c(2).

CDF Collaboration	Search for Top-Quark Production via Flavor-Changing Neutral Currents in W+1 Jet Events at CDF	PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS			English	Article							EP COLLISIONS; DECAYS; PHYSICS; HERA	We report on a search for the non-standard-model process u(c)+g -> t using pp collision data collected by the Collider Detector at Fermilab II detector corresponding to 2.2 fb(-1). The candidate events are classified as signal-like or backgroundlike by an artificial neural network. The observed discriminant distribution yields no evidence for flavor-changing neutral current top-quark production, resulting in an upper limit on the production cross section sigma(u(c)+g -> t)< 1.8 pb at the 95% C.L. Using theoretical predictions we convert the cross section limit to upper limits on flavor-changing neutral current branching ratios: B(t -> u+g)< 3.9x10(-4) and B(t -> c+g)< 5.7x10(-3).

These somatic stem cells have several characteristics resembling those of germ line stem cells in other animals, such as the presence of perinuclear RNA granules (chromatoid bodies). We have isolated a Tudor domain-containing gene in the planarian species Schmidtea polychroa, Spoltud-1, and show that it is expressed in neoblast cells, germ line cells and central nervous system, and during embryonic development. Within the neoblasts, Spoltud-1 protein is enriched in chromatoid bodies. Spoltud-1 RNAi eliminates protein expression after 3 weeks, and abolishes the power of regeneration of planarians after 7 weeks. Neoblast cells are eliminated by the RNAi treatment, disappearing at the end rather than gradually during the process. Neoblasts with no detectable Spoltud-1 protein are able to proliferate and differentiate. These results suggest that Spoltud-1 is required for long term stem cell self renewal. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Since reward processing is closely linked to the ventral striatum and the neurotransmitter dopamine, we examined the relationships between brain gray matter, placebo analgesic response, and personality traits associated with dopaminergic neurotransmission. We report that dopamine-related traits predict a substantial portion of the pain relief an individual gains from a sham treatment. Voxel-based morphometry of magnetic resonance images shows that the magnitude of placebo analgesia is related to gray matter density(GMD) in several brain regions, including the ventral striatum, insula, and prefrontal cortex. Similarly, GMD in ventral striatum and prefrontal cortex is related to dopamine-related personality traits. Our findings highlight the relationship between placebo and reward and potentially offer ways of identifying subjects who are likely to show large placebo analgesic responses.

Brain Dev Cooperative Grp	The effect of template choice on morphometric analysis of pediatric brain data	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Magnetic resonance imaging; Pediatric brain template; Spatial normalization; Tissue classification; Cortical surface; Parcellation	AUTOMATED 3-D EXTRACTION; SPATIAL NORMALIZATION; CORTICAL THICKNESS; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; WILLIAMS-SYNDROME; MRI DATA; SURFACE; CHILDREN; REGISTRATION; IMAGES	The present study investigated the "template effect" on the morphometric analysis of a pediatric brain MRI database obtained from 8-year-old children through various measures of surface and volumetric morphologies. We first constructed an age-appropriate template from an independent set of pediatric brain images and then compared it with a well-known adult brain template, the ICBM152, in terms of the morphometric features that resulted from our pediatric database. The individual cortical surface acquired based on the pediatric template exhibited, on average, a significantly thinner cortex (-1.66 +/- 1.60%, t=-15.18), larger cortical surface areas (0.31 +/- 0.70%, t=6.52), and a higher degree of cortical folding (0.08 +/- 0.13%, t=8.72) while compared with those based on the adult template. We also found a significant increase in the cerebrospinal fluid volume (-2.63 +/- 4.84) for the adult template based brains and the cortical gray matter (GM) volume (6.10 +/- 7.81) for the pediatric template based brains. The cross-correlation of pediatric template based individual brain data (0.95 without brain mask) was significantly higher than those of adult template based (0.88) and the amount of deformation during non-linear spatial normalization was significantly reduced when using the pediatric template (average magnitude of deformation in the cortical GM class: 1.71 mm vs. 2.23 mm, t=12.39). In addition, an "internal" pediatric template, taken from the study subjects themselves, was generated and compared with the "external" pediatric template for reference. There was no significant difference between these two pediatric brain templates and associated tissue probability maps. The results show that it is necessary to be cautious when interpreting results from pediatric imaging studies based on adult reference data. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Quantifying the risk of neurodegenerative disease in idiopathic REM sleep behavior disorder	NEUROLOGY			English	Article							PARKINSONS-DISEASE; OLDER-ADULTS; SYNUCLEINOPATHY; DEMENTIA; IDENTIFICATION; DYSFUNCTION; IMPAIRMENT; VALIDATION; RELEVANCE; TICS	Objective: Idiopathic REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is a potential preclinical marker for the development of neurodegenerative diseases, particularly Parkinson disease (PD) and Lewy body dementia. However, the long-term risk of developing neurodegeneration in patients with idiopathic RBD has not been established. Obtaining an accurate picture of this risk is essential for counseling patients and for development of potential neuroprotective therapies. Methods: We conducted a follow-up study of all patients seen at the sleep disorders laboratory at the Hopital du Sacre Coeur with a diagnosis of idiopathic RBD. Diagnoses of parkinsonism and dementia were defined according to standard criteria. Survival curves were constructed to estimate the 5-, 10-, and 12-year risk of developing neurodegenerative disease. Results: Of 113 patients, 93 (82%) met inclusion criteria. The mean age of participants was 65.4 years and 75 patients (80.4%) were men. Over the follow-up period, 26/93 patients developed a neurodegenerative disorder. A total of 14 patients developed PD, 7 developed Lewy body dementia, 4 developed dementia that met clinical criteria for AD, and 1 developed multiple system atrophy. The estimated 5-year risk of neurodegenerative disease was 17.7%, the 10-year risk was 40.6%, and the 12-year risk was 52.4%. Conclusions: Although we have found a slightly lower risk than other reports, the risk of developing neurodegenerative disease in idiopathic REM sleep behavior disorder is substantial, with the majority of patients developing Parkinson disease and Lewy body dementia.

Some highlights of research on the effects of caudate nucleus lesions over the past 200 years	BEHAVIOURAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Review						Caudoputamen; Caudate; Lesions; Dorsal Striatum; Learning; Memory	MULTIPLE MEMORY-SYSTEMS; FRONTAL CORTICAL ABLATIONS; LATERAL HYPOTHALAMIC-LESIONS; STRIATUM IMPAIR ACQUISITION; SIMPLE DISCRIMINATION TASK; STIMULUS-RESPONSE HABIT; DORSAL STRIATUM; PUTAMEN LESIONS; BASAL GANGLIA; WATER MAZE	This review describes experiments on the effects of caudate nucleus lesions on behavior in monkeys, cats and rats. Early work on monkeys and cats focused on the relationship of the caudate to the cortex in motor control, leading to the idea that the caudate serves to inhibit behaviors initiated by the cortex. However, investigation of this hypothesis with systematic behavioral testing in all three species did not support this idea; rather, these studies provided evidence that caudate lesions affect memory functions. Two main types of memory tasks were affected. One type involved reinforced stimulus-response (S-R) associations, the other involved spatial information, response-re in forcer contingencies, or working memory. Recent evidence, mainly from rats, suggests that the dorsolateral part of the caudoputamen is central to the processing and consolidation of memory for reinforced S-R associations, and that the more medial and anterior parts of the same structure are part of a neural circuit that (in some cases) also includes the hippocampus, and mediates relational information and certain forms of working memory. The possibility that the spatial distribution of the patch and matrix compartments within the caudoputamen underlies these regional differences is discussed. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Among multiple Ca2+ mechanisms operating in neuronal dendrites, voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels (VSCCs) represent a major source of Ca2+ influx; however, their use-dependent implication, regulation, and function in different types of central neurons remain widely unknown. Using two-photon microscopy to probe Ca2+ signaling in dendrites of hippocampal oriens/alveus interneurons, we found that intense synaptic activity or local activation of mGluR5 induced long-lasting potentiation of action potential evoked Ca2+ transients. This potentiation of dendritic Ca2+ signaling required mGluR5-induced intracellular Ca2+ release and PKC activation and was expressed as a selective compartmentalized potentiation of L-type VSCCs. Thus, in addition to mGluR1a-dependent synaptic plasticity, hippocampal interneurons in the feedback inhibitory circuit demonstrate a novel form of mGluR5-induced dendritic plasticity. Given an implication of L-type VSCCs in the induction of Hebbian LTP at interneuron excitatory synapses, their activity-dependent regulation may represent a powerful mechanism for regulating synaptic plasticity.

Activity Profiles of Cholinergic and Intermingled GABAergic and Putative Glutamatergic Neurons in the Pontomesencephalic Tegmentum of Urethane-Anesthetized Rats	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							SLEEP-WAKING CYCLE; BASAL FOREBRAIN; RETICULAR-FORMATION; PARADOXICAL SLEEP; REM-SLEEP; IN-VIVO; SLOW OSCILLATIONS; STATE CONTROL; CELL AREA; NUCLEUS	Cholinergic neurons in the pontomesencephalic tegmentum form part of the ascending activating system and are thought to participate in stimulating cortical activation. Yet in the laterodorsal tegmental and pedunculopontine tegmental nuclei (LDT and PPT), they lie intermingled with GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons, which could also modulate cortical activity and sleep-wake state. To characterize the discharge of these cell types in relation to cortical activity, we recorded neurons in urethane-anesthetized rats during spontaneous slow wave and somatosensory evoked fast electroencephalographic (EEG) activity, then labeled the cells by juxtacellular technique with Neurobiotin (Nb) and dual-immunostained them for vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT) and glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD). All cholinergic cells discharged minimally during prestimulation (similar to 0.5 Hz) and moderately in a tonic manner (similar to 4 Hz) during stimulation. Being heterogeneous, some GABAergic, called "On," cells (similar to 48%) increased their discharge (from similar to 4 to 7 Hz), whereas others, called "Off" cells (similar to 38%), decreased or ceased firing during stimulation. Similarly, some noncholinergic/non-GABAergic On cells increased (from similar to 2 to 6 Hz, similar to 49%), whereas other Off cells decreased firing (similar to 35%) during stimulation. Putative glutamatergic On together with GABAergic On neurons could thus act in parallel with cholinergic cells to stimulate cortical activation. Possibly influenced by cholinergic On and glutamatergic Off cells, whose change in discharge precedes theirs, the GABAergic Off cells could oppose neighboring neurons such as noradrenergic cells, which discharge during waking and cease firing during sleep. By concerted activity, these heterogeneous cell groups can modulate cortical activity and behavioral state across the sleep-waking cycle.

The syndrome is caused by the silencing of a single gene (fragile X mental retardation-1; FMR1) and the lack of expression of its protein product (fragile X mental retardation-1 protein; FMRP). Recent work has linked the high expression levels of FMRP in the magnocellular layers of lateral geniculate nucleus (M-LGN) of the visual system to a specific reduction of perceptual function known to be mediated by that neural structure. This finding has given rise to the intriguing notion that FMRP expression level may be used as an index of susceptibility of specific brain regions to the observed perceptual and cognitive deficits in FXS. We undertook a comprehensive expression profiling study of FMRP in the monkey to obtain further insight into the link between FMPR expression and the behavioural impact of its loss in FXS. We report here the first 3D whole-brain map of FMRP expression in the Old-World monkey and show that certain brain structures display high FMRP levels, such as the cerebellum, striatum, and temporal lobe structures. This finding provides support for the notion that FMRP expression loss is linked to behavioural and cognitive impairment associated with these structures. We argue that whole-brain FMRP expression mapping may be used to formulate and test new hypotheses about other forms of impairments in FXS that were not specifically examined in this study.

Here, we used the olfactory bulbectomy (OBX) model of depression to characterize cAMP-second messenger signaling pathways, i.e., adenylyl cyclase activity (basal, sodium fluoride (NaF)- and forskolin-stimulated conditions) as well as G(i) and G(s) protein levels in different regions of the limbic system. Two weeks after surgery and compared to sham controls, OBX rats displayed reduced NaF-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity and increased G(i)/G(s) ratios in the hypothalamus, pre-frontal and cingulate cortices but not in the amygdala, hippocampus and caudate nucleus. No differences were found in basal or forskolin-stimulated conditions. The observed reduction of adenylyl cyclase activity induced by NaF and the increase in the G(i)/G(s) ratio could explain the changes in neurotransmission in OBX rats as well as in humans with depression.

However, little attention has been paid to the possibility of genetic contributions to depressive symptoms in cardiac patients. We conducted a candidate gene study focusing on genes related to inflammation, platelet aggregation, endothelial function and omega-3 fatty acid metabolism as predictors of depressive symptoms among 977 participants with established cardiovascular disease. Results suggested that genetic variation related to endothelial dysfunction is predictive of depressive symptoms and that endothelial dysfunction may be a novel mechanism contributing to depressive symptoms among cardiac patients.

Amitrole is a pesticide potentially interfering with thyroid hormone regulation. In this study, the rare minnow (Gobiocypris rarus) was exposed to different levels of 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole(amitrole) and allowed to recover in clean water. Plasma TH levels and the expression of TH-related genes, including transthyretin(ttr), deiodinases (d1 and d2), and the thyroid hormone receptor (trot) from the livers and brains were evaluated. After exposure, the plasma TH levels did not change. Histopathological observations showed that livers were degenerated at 10,000 ng/l and these damages could be recovered by the withdrawal of amitrole. However, the ttr, d1, and d2 mRNA levels in the livers of males were significantly up-regulated in all exposure groups (p < 0.05). The ttr and d2 mRNA levels were significantly up-regulated at 10,000 ng/l and 10, 100, and 1000 ng/l in the livers of females, respectively (p < 0.05). In the brains of males, a twofold increase of d2 mRNA levels at >= 100 ng/l and a fivefold decrease of tr alpha mRNA levels at >= 10 ng/l were observed (p < 0.05), whereas no significant differences were observed in the expression of d2 and tra in the brains of females. After a recovery period, the ttr, d1, and d2 mRNA levels in the livers of males returned to control levels, but the trot mRNA levels were irreversibly decreased at all treatments (p < 0.05). In addition, the d2 mRNA levels in the livers of females were significantly induced at >= 100 ng/l. Moreover, the d2 mRNA levels in the brains of males and females were up-regulated at 10,000 ng/l. These results indicated that amitrole exposure could result in alternations of ttr, d1, d2, and trot gene expression in different tissues of the rare minnow. The expression of these TH-related genes in males was more sensitive to amitrole than those of females. Recovery in clean water was associated with the selective regulation of TH-related gene transcription in the rare minnow. Therefore, these TH-related genes can serve as biomarkers to screen the effects of thyroid disruption chemicals in rare minnow. (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Here, we find that Rab35 colocalizes with actin. laments and with Cdc42, Rac1 and RhoA, and that Rab35 can activate Cdc42 both in vivo and in vitro. We find activated Rab35 stimulates neurite outgrowth in PC12 and N1E-115 cells via a Cdc42-dependent pathway and that siRNA knockdown of Rab35 activity abolishes neurite outgrowth in these cell lines. We conclude that one function of Rab35 is to regulate Rho-family GTPases and that this role has consequences for neurite outgrowth.

The symposium involved presentations on current trends in aging and dementia research across several sub-disciplines: genetics, neurochemistry, structural and functional neuroimaging and clinical treatment and rehabilitation. The goal of this symposium was to provide a forum for knowledge-transfer between scientists and clinicians with different specializations in order to promote cross-fertilization of research ideas that would lead to future collaborative neuroscience research in aging and dementia. In this review article, we summarize the presentations made by the 13 international scientists at the symposium and highlight: (i) past research, and future research trends in neuroscience of aging and dementia and (ii) links across levels of analysis that can lead to fruitful transdisciplinary research programs that will advance knowledge about the neurobiological changes associated with healthy aging and dementia.

First published January 27, 2009; doi:10.1152/ajpendo.90725.2008.-Apolipoprotein D ( apoD), a widely expressed lipocalin, has the capacity to transport small hydrophobic molecules. Although it has been proposed that apoD may have multiple tissue-specific, physiological ligands and functions, these have yet to be identified. To gain insight in some of its functions, we generated transgenic mice over-expressing human apoD (H-apoD) under the control of neuron-specific promoters. In Thy-1/apoD and NSE/apoD mice, expression of H-apoD was strong in the nervous system although weakly detected in peripheral organs such as the liver and blood cells. These mice displayed not entirely anticipated metabolic defects. Although they are not obese and have normal lipid concentration in circulation, Thy-1/apoD and NSE/apoD mice are glucose intolerant, insulin resistant, and develop hepatic steatosis. The steatosis and its associated insulin resistance are correlated with impairments in hepatic lipogenesis. However, they are not strongly related with inflammation. This impaired insulin response is not caused by a decrease in circulating leptin or a modulation of adiponectin and resistin levels. These results suggest that variations in the levels and/or sites of apoD expression influence the lipid and glucose metabolism, consolidating apoD as a target for insulin-resistance-related disorders.

There is an accumulating body of evidence that the neurocognitive, inflammatory and cardiovascular symptoms that characterize the syndrome of obstructive sleep apnea are linked to the stimulus of intermittent hypoxia. In addition, altered sensitivities to opiates in children with obstructive sleep apnea have been linked to recurrent hypoxia during sleep. Therefore anesthesiologists should have an understanding of this important stimulus.

This study examined whether brain regions that concentrate steroid hormones and receive olfactory projections were important for the mediation of FMM. Fos induction was observed within the medial amygdala, medial preoptic area, and ventromedial hypothalamus of ovariectomized, hormone-primed rats that displayed FMM compared with rats that did not. Excitotoxic lesions of those regions eliminated FMM, whereas implants of crystalline estradiol benzoate to the ventromedial hypothalamus, but not the medial preoptic area or medial amygdala, restored FMM. These data indicate that the ventromedial hypothalamus is a critical area of convergence of hormonal, olfactory, and somatosensory inputs for FMM.

A Biosemiotic Approach to Wine-Tasting	BIOSEMIOTICS			English	Article						Wine-tasting; Sensation; Bodymind; Biosemiotics; Neurology; Knowledge		The object of our paper is to examine how wine-related knowledge and practices play an important role in determining the respective flavour experiences of novice wine drinkers and sommeliers. We defend the idea that sensation is informed by knowledge, as it circulates in a cultural environment. Biosemiotics has developed appropriate concepts helping us understand how the same wine can generate diverging experiences. Within a biosemiotic framework, we consider wine flavours as relational, semiosic experiences produced by the convergence of sensory-discriminative, motivational-affective and cognitive-evaluative factors. Drawing from fundamental biosemiotics we argue that these factors vary according to the creature and its simultaneously biological and cultural umwelt. We conclude by examining a series of empirical studies consolidating the idea that sensation is informed by knowledge and language.

HFOs occur predominantly in the seizure onset zone (SOZ) but their relationship to the underlying pathology is unknown. It was the aim of this study to investigate whether HFOs are specific to the SOZ or result from pathologically changed tissue, whether or not it is epileptogenic. Patients with different lesion types, namely mesial temporal atrophy (MTA), focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) and nodular heterotopias (NH) were investigated. Intracranial EEG was recorded from depth macroelectrodes with a sampling rate of 2000 Hz. Ripples (80250 Hz) and Fast Ripples (250500 Hz) were visually marked in 12 patients: five with MTA, four with FCD and three with NH. Rates of events were statistically compared in channels in four areas: lesional SOZ, non-lesional SOZ, lesional non-SOZ and non-lesional non-SOZ. HFO rates were clearly more linked to the SOZ than to the lesion. They were highest in areas in which lesion and SOZ overlap, but in patients with a SOZ outside the lesion, such as in NHs, HFO rates were clearly higher in the non-lesional SOZ than in the inactive lesions. No specific HFO pattern could be identified for the different lesion types. The findings suggest that HFOs represent a marker for SOZ areas independent of the underlying pathology and that pathologic tissue changes alone do not lead to high rates of HFOs.

The disorder is caused by the silencing of a single gene on the X chromosome, the FMR1 gene. The premutation (carrier) status, however, is less well documented but has an emerging literature that highlights a more subtle profile of executive cognitive deficiencies that mirror those reported in fully affected males. Rarely, however, has the issue of age-related declines in cognitive performance in premutation males been addressed. In the present study, we focus specifically on the cognitive domain of working memory and its subcomponents (verbal, spatial and central executive memory) and explore performance across a broad sample of premutation males aged 18-69 years matched on age and IQ to unaffected comparison males. We further tease apart the premutation status into those males with symptoms of the newly identified neurodegenerative disorder, the fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) and those males currently symptom-free. Our findings indicate a specific vulnerability in premutation males on tasks that require simultaneous manipulation and storage of new information, so-called executive control of memory. Furthermore, this vulnerability appears to exist regardless of the presence of FXTAS symptoms. Males with FXTAS symptoms demonstrated a more general impairment encompassing phonological working memory in addition to central executive working memory. Among asymptomatic premutation males, we observed the novel finding of a relationship between increased CGG repeat size and impairment to central executive working memory. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

While the Gate Control Theory was based on the notion that spinal inhibition is dynamically regulated, mechanisms underlying the regulation of inhibition have turned out to be far more complex than Melzack and wall could have ever imagined. Recent evidence indicates that an exquisitely sensitive form of regulation involves changes in anion equilibrium potential (E(anion)) which subsequently impacts fast synaptic inhibition mediated by GABA(A), and to a lesser extent, glycine receptor activation, the prototypic ligand gated anion channels. The cation-chloride co-transporters (in particular NKCC1 and KCC2) have emerged as proteins that play a critical role in the dynamic regulation of E(anion) which in turn appears to play a critical role in hyperalgesia and allodynia following peripheral inflammation or nerve injury. This review summarizes the current state of knowledge in this area with particular attention to how such findings relate to endogenous mechanisms of hyperalgesia and allodynia and potential applications for therapeutics based on modulation of intracellular Cl(-) gradients or pharmacological interventions targeting GABA(A) receptors.

Here, we review how TMS can be combined with various neuroimaging techniques to investigate human brain function. When applied during neuroimaging (online approach), TMS can be used to test how focal cortex stimulation acutely modifies the activity and connectivity in the stimulated neuronal circuits. TMS and neuroimaging can also be separated in time (offline approach). A conditioning session of repetitive TMS (rTMS) may be used to induce rapid reorganization in functional brain networks. The temporospatial patterns of TMS-induced reorganization can be subsequently mapped by using neuroimaging methods. Alternatively, neuroimaging may be performed first to localize brain areas that are involved in a given task. The temporospatial information obtained by neuroimaging can be used to define the optimal site and time point of stimulation in a subsequent experiment in which TMS is used to probe the functional contribution of the stimulated area. to a specific task. In this review, we first address some general methodologic issues that need to be taken into account when using TMS in the context of neuroimaging. We then discuss the use of specific brain mapping techniques in conjunction with TMS. We emphasize that the various neuroimaging techniques offer complementary information and have different methodologic strengths and weaknesses. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Modem frameless stereotaxic systems yield high accuracy, but require extensive equipment and cannot be used in every setting, for example, during functional imaging sessions. Objective The aim of this study was the development of a method for TMS-coil placement based on individual imaging data without the need for external tracking devices. Methods We compared coil positioning over Broca's area using an advanced stereotaxic navigation system with placement according to the surface distance measurements (SDM) method. By using the SDM-method, 3-dimensional renderings adapted from individual T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data were created to identify Broca's area and Broca's homologue, respectively, and to define anatomic landmarks on the skin's surface. Distances between these landmarks were used to localize the real target on the individual's head. Results The mean Euclidean distance between surface positions as determined with the two methods was 8.31 mm and the mean difference of estimated virtual electric field intensity at the target point was 7.37 V/m corresponding to 4.01% of maximum field strength. Conclusions Our findings Suggest that, compared with a state-of-the-art frameless stereotaxy system, the SDM-method yields a reasonable accuracy for positioning of a TMS-coil over Broca's area in terms of spatial coordinates.

Such advanced elements as underfloor air distribution (UFAD), passive swirl diffusers, and demand controlled ventilation have posed challenges to system design and operation. This paper is concerned with the development and implementation of a practical and robust optimization scheme, aiming to assist office building designers and operators to enhance thermal comfort and indoor air quality (IAQ) without sacrificing energy costs of ventilation. The objective function was constructed in a way attempting to aggregate and weight indices (for thermal comfort, IAQ, and ventilation energy usage assessment) into one indicator. The path taken was a simulation-based optimization approach by using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) techniques in conjunction with genetic algorithm (GA), with the integration of an artificial neural network (ANN) for response surface approximation (RSA) and for speeding up fitness evaluations inside GA loop.

Part I of this paper proposed a simulation-based optimization approach by using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) techniques in conjunction with genetic algorithm (GA), with the integration of an artificial neural network (ANN) for response surface approximation (RSA) and for speeding up fitness evaluations inside GA loop. In this part, the results from data preparation for ANN model construction, ANN training and testing, and sensitivity analysis (regarding the impact of weighting factors in the objective function on the optimization results) are presented.

Triple-Negative Breast Cancer: Distinguishing between Basal and Nonbasal Subtypes	CLINICAL CANCER RESEARCH			English	Article							GENE-EXPRESSION PROFILES; ESTROGEN-RECEPTOR; IMMUNOHISTOCHEMICAL MARKERS; PROGNOSTIC-SIGNIFICANCE; EPITHELIAL PHENOTYPE; MOLECULAR PORTRAITS; CARCINOMAS; TUMORS; BRCA1; CHEMOTHERAPY	Purpose: Triple-negative (TN; estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and HER-2 negative) cancer and basal-like breast cancer (BLBC) are associated with poor outcome and lack the benefit of targeted therapy. It is widely perceived that BLBC and TN tumors are synonymous and BLBC can be defined using a TN definition without the need for the expression of basal markers. Experimental Design: We have used two well-defined cohorts of breast cancers with a large panel of biomarkers, BRCA1 mutation status, and follow-up data to compare the clinicopathologic and immunohistochemical features of TN tumors expressing one or more of the specific basal markers (CK5/6, CK17, CK14, and epidermal growth factor receptor; BLBC) with those TN tumors that express none of these markers (TN3BKE-). Results: Here, we show that although the morphologic features of BLBC are not significantly different from that of TN3BKE- tumors, BLBC showed distinct clinical and immunophenotypic differences. BLBC showed a statistically significant association with the expression of the hypoxia-associated factor (CA9), neuroendocrine markers, and other markers of poor prognosis such as p53. A difference in the expression of cell cycle-associated proteins and biomarkers involved in the immunologic portrait of tumors was seen. Compared with TN3BKE- tumors, BLBC was positively associated with BRCA1 mutation status and showed a unique pattern of distant metastasis, better response to chemotherapy, and shorter survival. Conclusion: TN breast cancers encompass a remarkably heterogeneous group of tumors. Expression of basal markers identifies a biologically and clinically distinct subgroup of TN tumors, justifying the use of basal markers (in TN tumors) to define BLBC.

Plumbing in the embryo: developmental defects of the urinary tracts.Clin Genet 2009: 75: 307-317. (C) 2009 John wiley & sons A/S Kidney and urinary tract malformations are among the most frequent developmental defects identified in newborns. Ranging from asymptomatic to neonatal lethal, these malformations represent an important clinical challenge. Recent progress in understanding the developmental origin of urinary tract defects in the mouse and other animal models suggests a new framework for the interpretation of these defects in humans. Gene inactivation studies in mice provided invaluable information on the formation of the Wolffian duct, a central component of embryonic renal development, on ureter and kidney induction as well as on distal ureter maturation. All three developmental processes are crucial for normal urinary tract morphogenesis. A failure to complete these developmental steps is responsible for a spectrum of kidney and urinary tract malformations including renal agenesis, renal dysplasia, vesicoureteral reflux, hydroureter, hydronephrosis and ureterocele. Surprisingly, distal ureter maturation, the process by which the ureter is displaced from the Wolffian duct to its final position within the bladder wall, has only recently been characterized at the morphological level. Anomalies in this process are emerging as a major source of urinary tract developmental defects. This review is aimed at bridging the current knowledge on the morphological and molecular events identified in the mouse, together with clinical observations of urinary tract malformation in humans.

Design: A cross-sectional study on two separate days, using a web questionnaire. Setting: NPICU/PICUs affiliated to the Groupe Francophone de Reanimation et Urgences Pediatriques and the Reseau Mere-Enfant de la Francophonie. Patients: Children >1 month of gestationally corrected age. Measurements and Main Results: Disability was defined as a Pediatric Overall Performance Category >= 3 before admission and chronic conditions as hospitalization since birth or the presence before admission of any condition requiring ongoing pediatric subspecialty care that was expected to last >= 12 months. Intensivists indicated what rehabilitation services they would have ideally prescribed ("perceived needs") and those provided. Of 45 affiliated units, 8 PICUs and 15 NPICUs participated. Staff included or had access to a psychologist (11 and 5, respectively), a social worker (10 and 3), a physiotherapist (11 and 12), a "psychomotrician" (2 and 8), a child educator (1 and 6), and a speech-language pathologist (0 and 6). Among 289 recorded intensive care unit-days, 236 were analyzed (excluding those for children admitted after surgery): 57 concerned children hospitalized since birth and 179 children admitted from home. Among these 179 recorded intensive care unit-days, 107 concerned children with chronic conditions (including 50 concerning disabled children) and 72 previously healthy children. Thus, prevalence of chronic conditions, including children hospitalized since birth, was 67%. Rehabilitation services included respiratory physical therapy (552 visits), musculoskeletal physical therapy (71), neurologic physical therapy (37), rehabilitation for swallowing (11), and for speech-language disorders (1), representing 79% of perceived needs. Conclusions: Prevalence of chronic conditions in NPICU/PICU was 67%. More attention must be paid to the rehabilitation care needs of patients during their NPICU/PICU stay and after discharge.

However, the origin of such dreams remains largely unexplained, and there have been no attempts to reconcile repetitive traumatic nightmares with nontraumatic nightmares, dysphoric dreams that do not awaken the dreamer, or with more normative dreams. Based on recent research in cognitive neuroscience, sleep physiology, fear conditioning, and emotional-memory regulation, we propose a multilevel neurocognitive model that unites waking and sleeping as a conceptual framework for understanding a wide spectrum of disturbed dreaming. We propose that normal dreaming serves a fear-extinction function and that nightmares reflect failures in emotion regulation. We further suggest that nightmares occur as a result of two processes that we term affect load-a consequence of daily variations in emotional pressures-and affect distress-a disposition to experience events with high levels of negative emotional reactivity.

Consequently, their consideration requires stressful and often critical decisions from both clinicians and families. This has resulted in an emergent need to understand better the impact of these early life lesions on child development. We performed a comprehensive literature search of studies describing neurodevelopmental outcomes of cerebellar malformations between January 1997 and December 2007. Overall, the data suggested that children with isolated inferior vermis hypoplasia (IVH) and mega cisterna magna (MCM) have a good developmental outcome, whereas children with molar tooth sign/Joubert syndrome, vermis hypoplasia, pontocerebellar hypoplasia (PCH) type II, and cerebellar agenesis experience moderate to severe global developmental delays. Reports for Dandy-Walker malformation (DWM) were conflicting; however, the presence of a normally lobulated vermis and the absence of associated brain anomalies were associated with a more favourable outcome. Finally, children with isolated cerebellar hypoplasia experienced fewer impairments. Important methodological limitations highlighted include a lack of standardized outcome measure use in 79% of studies and the predominant use of retrospective study designs (85%), with 40% limited to case reports or case-series. In summary, rigorous outcome studies describing the spectrum of disabilities in survivors are urgently needed to accurately delineate the long-term neurodevelopmental consequences of cerebellar malformations.

Structural and functional neuroanatomy of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)	ENCEPHALE-REVUE DE PSYCHIATRIE CLINIQUE BIOLOGIQUE ET THERAPEUTIQUE			French	Article						Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD); Magnetic resonance imagery (MRI)	ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; MAGNETIC-RESONANCE; CORPUS-CALLOSUM; CHILDREN; MRI; ADOLESCENTS; FMRI; INHIBITION; ACTIVATION	Introduction.-Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common and impairing neuropsychiatric disorder with preschool onset. ADHD occurs in approximately 3-9% of the childhood population. There is a much higher incidence rate in boys who are around three times more likely than girls to be diagnosed. Approximately 30-60% of individuals diagnosed with ADHD in youth have symptoms that persist into adulthood. Literature findings.-Three subtypes of the disorder have been proposed in the current clinical view of ADHD: inattentive, hyperactive-impulsive and combined type. Numerous problems are associated with ADHD: poor academic performance, learning disorders, subtle cognitive deficits, conduct disorders, antisocial personality disorder, poor social relationships, and a higher incidence of anxiety and depression symptoms into adulthood. Researchers have emphasized poor behavioural inhibition as the central impairment of the disorder. From the neuropsychological viewpoint, impairment of the "hot" affective aspects of executive functions, like behavioural inhibition and attention and the more cognitive, "cool" aspects of executive functions like self-regulation, working memory, planning, and cognitive flexibility, are often reported by studies on ADHD. The hot executive functions are associated with ventral and medial regions of the prefrontal cortex (including the anterior cingulated cortex) and named "hotbrain" and the cool executive functions are associated with the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and are called "coolbrain". Discussion.-Convergent data from neuroimaging, neuropsychology, genetics and neurochemical studies consistently point to the involvement of the frontostriatal network as a likely contributor to the pathophysiology of ADHD. This network involves the lateral prefrontal cortex, the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, the caudate nucleus and putamen. Moreover, a growing literature demonstrates abnormalities affecting other cortical regions and the cerebellum. The exploratory brain regions of interest in which abnormalities have been identified, but that were not predicted by cognitive models of ADHD, are the temporal lobe, parietal lobe, occipital lobe and lateral ventricles. Anatomical studies suggest widespread reductions in volume throughout the cerebrum and cerebellum, white functional imaging studies suggest that affected individuals activate more diffuse areas than controls during the performance of cognitive tasks. More precisely, reductions in volume have been observed in the total cerebral volume, the prefrontal cortex, the basal ganglia (striatum), the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, the corpus callosum and the cerebellum. Furthermore, hypoactivation of the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, the frontal cortex and the basal ganglia (striatum) have also been reported. The paradigms mostly used in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) are tasks of motor inhibition, interference and attention such as the go/no-go, "stop-signal" and the Stroop. Conclusion.-This review provides an overview of the main imaging studies that investigated the neurobiological substrate of ADHD. Some guidelines for future functional magnetic imaging studies are also suggested. (C) L'Encephale, Paris, 2008.

J	Sablier, J; Stip, E; Franck, N				Sablier, J.; Stip, E.; Franck, N.			Cognitive remediation and cognitive assistive technologies in schizophrenia	ENCEPHALE-REVUE DE PSYCHIATRIE CLINIQUE BIOLOGIQUE ET THERAPEUTIQUE			French	Article						Schizophrenia; Cognitive remediation; Assistive cognitive technology; Autonomy; Quality of life	ENHANCEMENT THERAPY; FUNCTIONAL CONSEQUENCES; REHABILITATION; DEFICITS; PROGRAM; FUTURE; SKILLS; IMPACT; TRIAL	Background. - Cognitive impairments are a core feature in schizophrenia. They impact several cognitive abilities but most importantly attention, memory and executive functions, consequently leading to great difficulties in everyday life. Most schizophrenia patients need assurance and require assistance and help from care workers, family members and friends. Family members taking care of a patient have additional daily work burden, and suffer psychological anguish and anxiety. Therefore, improving cognitive functions in schizophrenia patients is essential for the well-being of patients and their relatives. Reducing these deficits may decrease the economic burden to the health care system through tower numbers of hospital admissions and shorter hospitalisation periods, for example. Cognitive rehabilitation was developed to address the limited benefits of conventional treatments on cognitive deficits through the use of assistive technology as a means of enhancing memory and executive skills in schizophrenia patients. Objective. - To provide clinicians with comprehensive knowledge on cognitive trainings, programs of remediation, and cognitive assistive technologies. Method. - Literature review. A search in the electronic databases (PubMed, EMBASE, Index Medicus) for recent articles in the last 10 years related to cognitive remediation published in any language using the words: cognitive and remediation or rehabilitation and schizophrenia, and a search for chapters in psychiatry and rehabilitation textbooks. Results. - We found 392 articles and 112 review paper mainly in English. First, we identified cognitive remediation programs that were beneficial to schizophrenia patients. Programs available in French (IPT, RECOS, and RehaCom (R)) and others (CET, NET, CRT, NEAR, APT and CAT) were identified. In addition, since memory and executive function impairments could be present in people without schizophrenia, we reviewed inventories of cognitive assistive technologies proven to enhance cognitive skills in other populations. Finally, we present a review of recent studies testing innovative devices developed to assist schizophrenia patients. Discussion. - First, we found several cognitive programs proven to be effective with schizophrenia patients, but only three were validated in French. It could be useful to adapt other programs for French-speaking populations. Unfortunately, we found that very few of the existing cognitive assistive technologies are proposed to be used with schizophrenia patients. In fact, most of the available cognitive orthoses were tested primarily in people with neurological injuries (for example, various memory impairments caused by traumas), and in elderly illnesses (like Alzheimer disease). Devices for patients with mental deficits (e.g., mental retardation) were developed later, and only very recently explored for use in schizophrenia. As a result of an international collaboration between France and Canada, currently a tool. called MOBUS is being tested. This technology aims at improving the autonomy of schizophrenia patients, by helping them plan and remember their daily activities. Furthermore, it encourages patient-caregiver communication, and permits monitoring patients' subjective reports of their symptoms. The use of cognitive assistive technologies is not meant to isolate patients by replacing the human element of relatives and caregivers by a machine. On the contrary, they offer a sense of security and they improve interpersonal relationships by permitting enhanced autonomy and greater self-confidence. Finally, a literature review of cognitive remediation in schizophrenia emphasizes the importance of a structured application of the technique in order for it to succeed. First, it is crucial to detect the impairments that wilt be targeted in each patient presenting a specific pattern of impairments. For this purpose, validated and customised neuropsychological tests are required. Then, cognitive remediation programs must be customised to each patient's needs in order to motivate the patient to participate. Finally, long-term effects must be assessed in order to verify whether reinforcement is needed. Following these steps, most of the studies show an improvement in the well-being of patients with schizophrenia. These recommendations are also suitable for the cognitive remediation programs, as for treatments with cognitive assistive devices. An important hurdle facing the advance of cognitive assistive technology programs is that different research groups work individually without a coordinated effort to improve and validate the existing programs. Conclusion. - Schizophrenia treatments must take into account not only patients' symptoms, but also the associated cognitive deficits which constitute an important factor in their social problems. It has been shown that several cognitive remediation programs are efficient in schizophrenia. New technologies complement the benefits of such programs, and support pharmacological treatments and psychotherapies. (c) L'Encephale, Paris, 2008.

Cloning of Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone I Complementary DNAs in Songbirds Facilitates Dissection of Mechanisms Mediating Seasonal Changes in Reproduction	ENDOCRINOLOGY			English	Article							STARLINGS STURNUS-VULGARIS; ZONOTRICHIA-LEUCOPHRYS-GAMBELII; SPARROWS PASSER-DOMESTICUS; WHITE-CROWNED SPARROW; EUROPEAN STARLINGS; PHOTOPERIODIC CONTROL; LUTEINIZING-HORMONE; STEROID-HORMONES; MESSENGER-RNA; BRAIN GNRH	Temperate zone animals exhibit seasonal variation in reproductive physiology. In most cases, seasonal changes in reproductive states are regulated by changes in GnRH1 secretion, rather than synthesis, from the preoptic area (POA)/anterior hypothalamus. An important exception occurs in some songbirds that become photorefractory to the stimulatory effects of long days and show profound decreases in brain GnRH1 protein content. Whether this decline reflects changes in gene expression is unknown because of past failures to measure GNRH1 mRNA levels, due in large part to the absence of available GNRH1 gene sequence in this taxon. Here, we report the first cloning of GNRH1 cDNAs in two songbirds: European starlings and zebra finches. Consistent with the size of the prepro-hormone in other avian and non-avian species, the open-reading frames predict proteins of 91 and 92 amino acids, respectively. Whereas the decapeptide in both species is perfectly conserved with chicken GnRH1, the amino acid identity in the signal peptide and GNRH associated peptide subdomains are significantly less well conserved. At the nucleotide level, the starling and zebra finch coding sequences are approximately 88% identical to each other but only approximately 70% identical to chicken GNRH1. In situ hybridization using radiolabeled cRNA probes demonstrated GNRH1 mRNA expression primarily in the POA, consistent with previous studies on the distribution of the GnRH1-immunoreactive cell bodies. Furthermore, we provide evidence for photoperiod-dependent regulation of GNRH1 mRNA in male starlings. Declines in GNRH1 mRNA levels occur in parallel with testicular involution. Thus, photorefractoriness is associated with decreases in GNRH1 gene expression in the medial POA. (Endocrinology 150: 1826-1833, 2009)	[Stevenson, T. J.; Lynch, K. S.; Ball, G.

Ten-minute epochs of wakefulness (W), stage 1-2 non-REM (N1-N2), stage 3 non-REM (N3) and REM sleep (R) were identified from stereo-electroencephalography (SEEG) data recorded at 2 kHz in nine patients. Rates of spikes, ripples (> 80 Hz), and fast ripples (> 250 Hz) were calculated, as were HFO durations, degree of spike-HFO overlap, HFO rates inside and outside of spikes, and inside and outside of the seizure-onset zone (SOZ). Ripples were observed in nine patients and fast ripples in eight. Spike rate was highest in N1-N2 in 5 of 9 patients, and in N3 in 4 of 9 patients, whereas ripple rate was highest in N1-N2 in 4 of 9 patients, in N3 in 4 of 9 patients, and in W in 1 of 9 patients. Fast ripple rate was highest in N1-N2 in 4 of 8 patients, and in N3 in 4 of 8 patients. HFO properties changed significantly with sleep stage, although the absolute effects were small. The difference in HFO rates inside and outside of the SOZ was highly significant (p < 0.000001) in all stages except for R and, for fast ripples, only marginally significant (p = 0.018) in W. Rates of HFOs recorded from depth macroelectrodes are highest in non-REM sleep. HFO properties were similar in stages N1-N2 and N3, suggesting that accurate sleep staging is not necessary. The spatial specificity of HFO, particularly fast ripples, was affected by sleep stage, suggesting that recordings excluding REM sleep and wakefulness provide a more reliable indicator of the SOZ.

This therapy enhances the firing rate of rat norepinephrine neurons after 1 h and that of serotonin (5-HT) neurons only after 14 days. Various stimulation parameters were thus tested on their capacity to enhance 5-HT neuronal firing because of the delayed action of VNS on the 5-HT system and its important rote in the antidepressant response. Rats were implanted with a stimulator and treated for 14 days, each group of rats having only one stimulation parameter modified from the standard ones (0.25 mA, 20 Hz, 500 mu s, 30 s ON/5 min OFF). Electrophysiological recordings showed that the usual parameters utilized in depressed patients, with the exception of current intensity, produced an optimal activation of 5-HT neurons. Excessive enhancement of the charge delivered to the nerve can lead to a loss of VNS effect on 5-HT neuronal firing. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. and ECNP. All rights reserved.

A total of 12 healthy male participants underwent a PET scan presented with four scanning conditions; two left-sided intranasal CO(2)-stimuli and two matched baseline conditions consisting of odorless air. CO(2) was used as it produces burning and stinging sensations. Stimulation started 20 s before intravenous injection of the isotope and lasted for the first 60 s of the 5 min scan time. A comparison between CO(2) and baseline showed a pronounced activation of the trigeminal projection area at the base of the postcentral gyrus (primary and secondary somatosensory cortex) which was more intense for the right hemisphere, contralateral to the side of stimulation. In addition, activation was also found in the piriform cortex which is typically activated following odor presentation and thus thought of as primary olfactory cortex. In conclusion, and in line with previously published work, our data suggest that intranasal trigeminal Stimulation not only activates somatosensory projection areas, but that it also leads to activation in cerebral areas associated with the processing of olfactory information. This may be interpreted in terms of the intimate relation between the intranasal chemosensory systems. Hum Brain Mapp 30:1100-1104, 2009. (C) 2008 Wiley.Liss. Inc.

Although parametric maps have been used to identify areas of eloquent cortex such as the primary (S1) and secondary (S2) somatosensory areas for tumor surgery, to date, few fMRI methods exist to localize subcortical targets for surgical interventions used to treat movement disorders. The scanning time required to obtain statistically significant functional signals must be balanced against the possibility of movement artifacts and patient discomfort. We propose a vibrotactile stimulation technique to activate the somatosensory pathway for neurosurgical planning and perform a sensitivity analysis to determine the amount of time required to achieve significant activations of S1, S2, and sensory thalamus in individual Subjects. Bilateral Stimulation experiments were carried out on two MRI scanners (n = 13 at 1.5 T; n = 5 at 3.0 T). The analysis demonstrates that statistically significant functional activations can be achieved in clinically acceptable times: 16 min at 1.5 T (26/26 experiments) and 6 min at 3.0 T (10/10) for S1 activations; 24 min at 1.5 T (22/26) and 18 min at 3.0 T for S2 activations (9/10); and 32 min at 1.5 T (15/26) and 18 min at 3.0 T (10/10) for activation of thalamic nuclei. These results demonstrate that SI and S2 activations are robust at 1.5 and 3.0 T, and that robust thalamic activations in individual subjects are possible at 3.0 T. These techniques demonstrate that this technique can be used for preoperative planning for surgical candidates. Hum Brain Mapp 30:1328-1337, 2009. (C) 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.	[Chakravarty, M.

To deal with the nonaffine problem in face of the nonsmooth characteristics of hysteresis, the mean-value theorem is applied successively, first to the functions in the pure-feedback plant, and then to the hysteresis input function. Unknown uncertainties are compensated for using the function approximation capability of neural networks. The unknown virtual control directions are dealt with by Nussbaum functions. By utilizing Lyapunov synthesis, the closed-loop control system is proved to be semiglobally uniformly ultimately bounded, and the tracking error converges to a small neighborhood of zero. Simulation results are provided to illustrate the performance of the proposed approach.

We present a dynamical system model that is based on these two conditions. The collection of neurons are partitioned into clusters on which we define a map that reflects the communication between clusters. Such a map displays the forward and backward circuitry between clusters in a probabilistic manner. The presence of "re-entry" guarantees that the map is sufficiently complex, that is, nonlinear and chaotic, to possess numerous invariant sets of clusters, which are referred to as agglomerations. We suggest that an agglomeration that is mixing characterizes a conscious state. The model establishes a theoretical framework that may structure and encourage experimental work.

The biology of childhood obesity was the theme of an international symposium held in November 2007. Speakers discussed monogenic causes of obesity, prenatal epigenetic programing, neurobehavioral aspects of obesity, and hormonal and neuroendocrine abnormalities, and the insights provided by non-murine models for understanding the biology of early-onset obesity. Several new developments have been reported in white and brown adipose tissue biology. They are summarized briefly in this review and include observations about cell lineage of adipocytes, the renewal of adipocytes throughout life and the numerous factors that influence adipocyte fatty acid release. The biological underpinnings of childhood obesity are multiple and complex.	[Mitchell, G.

There is little in the literature about the anaesthetic management of parturients with this condition. We report the anaesthetic management for caesarean section of two such parturients. One patient, with significant pulmonary involvement, received neuraxial anaesthesia for caesarean delivery. The second patient had general anaesthesia because investigations could not rule out neurological involvement. We review and discuss the anaesthetic considerations for obstetric patients with hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Coexpression of alpha(2A)-Adrenergic and delta-Opioid Receptors in Substance P-Containing Terminals in Rat Dorsal Horn	JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE NEUROLOGY			English	Article						immunohistochemistry; large dense-core vesicle; synaptosome; primary afferent; nociceptor; terminal	GENE-RELATED PEPTIDE; SPINAL-CORD SYNAPTOSOMES; CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; SUPERFICIAL LAYERS; MORPHINE TREATMENT; KNOCKOUT MICE; DIFFERENTIAL DISTRIBUTION; ISOBOLOGRAPHIC ANALYSIS; NORADRENERGIC AGONISTS; INTRATHECAL MORPHINE	Agonists acting at alpha(2)-adrenergic and opioid receptors (alpha(2)ARs and ORs, respectively) inhibit pain transmission in the spinal cord. When coadministered, agonists activating these receptors interact in a synergistic manner. Although the existence of alpha(2)AR/OR synergy has been well characterized, its mechanism remains poorly understood. The formation of heterooligomers has been proposed as a molecular basis for interactions between neuronal G-protein-coupled receptors. The relevance of heterooligomer formation to spinal analgesic synergy requires demonstration of the expression of both receptors within the same neuron as well as the localization of both receptors in the same neuronal compartment. We used immunohistochemistry to investigate the spatial relationship between alpha(2)ARs and ORs in the rat spinal cord to determine whether coexpression could be demonstrated between these receptors. We observed extensive colocalization between alpha(2A)-adrenergic and delta-opioid receptors (DOP) on substance P (SP)-immunoreactive (-ir) varicosities in the superficial dorsal horn of the spinal cord and in peripheral nerve terminals in the skin. alpha(2A)AR- and DOP-ir elements were colocalized in subcellular structures of 0.5 mu m or less in diameter in isolated nerve terminals. Furthermore, coincubation of isolated synaptosomes with alpha(2)AR and DOP agonists resulted in a greater-than-additive increase in the inhibition of K+-stimulated neuropeptide release. These findings suggest that coexpression of the synergistic receptor pair alpha(2A)AR-DOP on primary afferent nociceptive fibers may represent an anatomical substrate for analgesic synergy, perhaps as a result of protein-protein interactions such as heterooligomerization.

Sixteen men with coronary heart disease underwent a cardiopulmonary exercise testing and a quadriceps skeletal muscle fatigue assessment. Patients were divided into two groups and trained in a combined aerobic and resistance or aerobic training group during 7 weeks. Maximal voluntary contraction and isometric endurance time were measured with electromyographic signals recorded from vastus lateralis (VL), rectus femoris (RF) and vastus medialis (VM) during isometric endurance time. Exercise tolerance increased only in the combined group (p < 0.05). Maximal voluntary contraction and isometric endurance time did not change after training in either group but was performed at 5.8% higher force output for the combined group. After training, median frequency values were higher for the VL and VM (p < 0.001) in the aerobic group and also higher for the VL, RF (p < 0.001) and VM (p < 0.05) in the combined group. Combined aerobic and resistance training was more effective to improve exercise tolerance, decrease skeletal muscle fatigue and correct neuromuscular alterations in men with coronary heart disease.

The precise pathophysiologic mechanisms responsible have not been fully elucidated but it has been recently proposed that microglia-derived proinflammatory cytokines are involved. In the present study we evaluated the role of microglial activation and the protective effect of the anti-inflammatory drug minocycline in the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy and brain edema in rats with ALF resulting from hepatic devascularisation. ALF rats were killed 6 h after hepatic artery ligation before the onset of neurological symptoms and at coma stages of encephalopathy along with their appropriate sham-operated controls and in parallel with minocycline-treated ALF rats. Increased OX-42 and OX-6 immunoreactivities confirming microglial activation were accompanied by increased expression of interleukins (IL-1 beta, IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) in the frontal cortex at coma stage of encephalopathy in ALF rats compared with sham-operated controls. Minocycline treatment prevented both microglial activation as well as the up-regulation of IL-1 beta, Iota L-6 and TNF-alpha mRNA and protein expression with a concomitant attenuation of the progression of encephalopathy and brain edema. These results offer the first direct evidence for central proinflammatory mechanisms in the pathogenesis of brain edema and its complications in ALF and suggest that anti-inflammatory agents may be beneficial in these patients.

Neurons in the frontal eye fields (FEFs) register incoming visual information and select visual stimuli that are relevant for behavior. Here we investigated the timing of the visual response and the timing of selection by recording from single FEF neurons in a curve-tracing task that requires shifts of attention followed by an oculomotor response. We found that the behavioral selection signal in area FEF had a latency of 147 ms and that it was delayed substantially relative to the visual response, which occurred 50 ms after stimulus presentation. We compared the FEF responses to activity previously recorded in the primary visual cortex (area V1) during the same task. Visual responses in area V1 preceded the FEF responses, but the latencies of selection signals in areas V1 and FEF were similar. The similarity of timing of selection signals in structures at opposite ends of the visual cortical processing hierarchy supports the view that stimulus selection occurs in an interaction between widely separated cortical regions.

Reaching to multiple targets when standing: the spatial organization of feedforward postural adjustments. J Neurophysiol 101: 2120-2133, 2009. First published February 11, 2009; doi:10.1152/jn.91135.2008. We examined the spatial organization of feedforward postural adjustments produced prior to and during voluntary arm reaching movements executed while standing. We sought to investigate whether the activity of postural muscles before and during reaching was directionally tuned and whether a strategy of horizontal force constraint could be observed. To this end, eight human subjects executed self-paced reach-to-point movements on the random illumination of one of 13 light targets placed within a 180 array centered along the midline of the body. Analysis was divided into two periods: a first corresponding to the 250 ms preceding the onset of the reaching movements ( termed pPA period) and a second 250-ms period immediately preceding target attainment ( the aPA period). For both periods, electromyographic activity of the lower limb muscles revealed a clear directional tuning, with groups of muscles being activated for similar directions of reach. Analysis of horizontal ground reaction forces supported the existence of a force constraint strategy only for the pPA period, however, with those in the aPA period being more widely dispersed. We suggest that the strategy adopted for feedforward pPAs is one where the tuned muscle synergies constrain the forces diagonally away from the center of mass (CoM) to move it within the support base. However, the need to control for final finger and body position for each target during the aPA phase resulted in a distribution of vectors across reaching directions. Overall, our results would support the idea that endpoint limb force during postural tasks depends on the use of functional muscle synergies, which are used to displace the CoM or decelerate the body at the end of the reach.

The knowledge about the mechanisms that keep neuronal precursors in the migratory stream and organize this long-distance migration is incomplete. Here we show that blood vessels precisely outline the migratory stream for new neurons in the adult mammalian forebrain. Real-time video imaging of cell migration in the acute slices demonstrate that neuronal precursors are retained in the migratory stream and guided into the OB by blood vessels that serve as a physical substrate for migrating neuroblasts. Our data suggest that endothelial cells of blood vessels synthesize brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) that fosters neuronal migration via p75NTR expressed on neuroblasts. Interestingly, GABA released from neuroblasts induces Ca(2+)-dependent insertion of high-affinity TrkB receptors on the plasma membrane of astrocytes that trap extracellular BDNF. We hypothesize that this renders BDNF unavailable for p75NTR-expressing migrating cells and leads to their entrance into the stationary period. Our findings provide new insights into the functional organization of substrates that facilitate the long-distance journey of adult neuronal precursors.

Recently, the hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and its receptor, the tyrosine kinase Met, have emerged as key components of human medulloblastoma growth and metastasis, suggesting that inhibition of this pathway may represent art attractive target for the prevention and treatment of this disease. Using immunoblotting procedures, we observed that the dietary-derived flavonols quercetin, kaempferol, and myricetin inhibited HGF/Met signaling in a medulloblastoma cell line (DAOY). preventing the formation of actin-rich membrane ruffles and resulting in the inhibition of Met-induced cell migration in Boyden chambers. Furthermore, quercetin and kaempferol also strongly diminished HGF-mediated Akt activation. Interestingly, the inhibitory effects of quercetin on the tyrosine kinase receptor Met [half-maximal inhibitory effect (IC(50)) of 12 mu mol/L] or on the Met-induced activation of Akt (IC(50) of 2.5 mu mol/L) occurred at concentrations achievable through dietary approaches. These results highlight quercetin, kaempferol, and myricetin as dietary-derived inhibitors of Met activity and suggest that this inhibitory effect may contribute to the chemopreventive properties of these molecules J.

Healthy subjects in three age groups (23 +/- 1, 50 +/- 1 and 76 +/- 2 y old) were given a ketogenic meal and plasma -hydroxybutyrate, glucose, insulin, triacylglycerols, total cholesterol, non-esterified fatty acids and breath acetone were measured over the subsequent 6 h. Each subject completed the protocol twice in order to determine the oxidation of a tracer dose of both carbon-13 ((13)C) glucose and (13)C- -hydroxybutyrate. The tracers were given separately in random order. Apolipoprotein E genotype was also determined in all subjects. Plasma glucose decreased and -hydroxybutyrate, acetone and insulin increased similarly over 6 h in all three groups after the ketogenic meal. There was no significant change in cholesterol, triacylglycerols or non-esterified fatty acids over the 6 h. (13)C-glucose and (13)C- -hydroxybutyrate oxidation peaked at 2-3 h post-dose for all age groups. Cumulative (13)C-glucose oxidation over 24 h was significantly higher in the elderly but only versus the middle-aged group. There was no difference in cumulative 13C- -hydroxybutyrate oxidation between the three groups. Apolipoprotein E ( 4) was associated with elevated fasting cholesterol but was unrelated to the other plasma metabolites. Elderly people in relatively good health have a similar capacity to produce ketones and to oxidize (13)C- -hydroxybutyrate as middle-aged or young adults, but oxidize (13)C-glucose a little more rapidly than healthy middle-aged adults.

The clinic was created to provide a comprehensive assessment of patients with dysphagia. All patients are evaluated with flexible endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (FEES) and other necessary investigations. Following this evaluation, appropriate treatment, dietary modifications, and swallowing techniques are taught to the patient. Objective: To study the characteristics of the population evaluated at the McGill University Health Centre Dysphagia Clinic to better understand the role and impact of a multidisciplinary team. Method: A retrospective chart review of 183 patients presenting to the Dysphagia Clinic since its creation in December 2004 was conducted. Information regarding demographics, etiology, comorbidities, additional referrals or investigations, treatment, and outcome was collected. Results: The majority of patients (61%) were referred by otolaryngologists. The FEES was normal for all consistencies in 28% of patients, and pooling was the most frequently encountered abnormality. The most common etiologies were neurologic (27%), laryngopharyngeal reflux (22%), and malignancy (21%). The four treatment modalities consisted of dietary modifications (37%), teaching of therapeutic swallowing manoeuvres (33%), medical treatment (26%), and surgical treatment (11%). Conclusion: A multidisciplinary dysphagia clinic is an invaluable resource for patients suffering from cervical dysphagia. As the etiologies and initial presentation of patients vary greatly, otolaryngologists' expertise in endoscopy gives them a critical role in the evaluation of this condition.

The fundamental problem with ridges is to find a correspondence among and analyze the variability among them. Many techniques to achieve these goals exist but use scalar functions. Depth maps are used to efficiently project the geometry of folds into a scalar function in the case where a natural projection plane exists. However, in most cases of curved surfaces, there is no natural projection plane to represent folding patterns. This paper studies the problem of shape matching and analysis of folding patterns by extending the notion of depth maps when no natural projection plane exists. The novel depth measure is called a depth potential function. The depth potential function integrates the information known from the curvature of the surface into a point-of-view invariant representation. The main advantage of the depth potential function is that it is computed by solving a time independent Poisson equation. The Poisson equation endows our surface representation with a significant computational advantage that makes it orders of magnitude faster to compute compared with other available surface representations. The method described in this paper was validated using both synthetic surfaces and cortical surfaces of human brain acquired by magnetic resonance imaging. On average, the improvement in shape matching when using the depth potential was of 11%, which is considerable. Crown Copyright (C) 2008 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Information content of SNR/resolution trade-offs in three-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging	MEDICAL PHYSICS			English	Article						biomedical MRI; brain	TO-NOISE RATIO; NATURAL IMAGES; HUMAN VISION; QUALITY; MRI; STATISTICS; RESOLUTION	In MRI, a trade-off exists between resolution and signal-to-noise ratio, since different fractions of the available scan time can be used to acquire data at higher spatial frequencies and to perform signal averaging. By comparing a wide variety of 3D isotropic MR scans with different combinations of SNR, resolution, and scan duration, the impact of this trade-off on the image information content was assessed. The information content of mouse brain, mouse whole-body, and human brain images was evaluated using a simple numerical approach, which sums the information contribution of each individual k-space data point. Results show that, with a fixed receiver bandwidth and field of view, the information content of trade-off images is always maximized when the SNR is equal to about 16. The optimal imaging resolution is dependent on the scan duration, as well as certain MR system properties, such as field strength and coil sensitivity. These properties are, however, easily accounted for with the acquisition of a single scout MR image, and the optimal imaging resolution can then be calculated using a simple mathematical relationship. If the imaging task is approached with a predetermined resolution requirement, the same scout scan can be used to calculate the scan duration that will provide the maximum possible information. Using these relationships to maximize the image information content is an excellent technique for guiding the initial selection of imaging parameters.	[Portnoy, S.; Kale, S.

Taking advantage of the spatial and temporal separation of proliferating and differentiated cells within the developing anterior pituitary gland, we investigated the control of cell proliferation during organogenesis. Thus, we identified a population of noncycling precursors that are uniquely marked by expression of the cell cycle inhibitor p57(Kip2) and by cyclin E. In p57(Kip2-/-) mice, the developing pituitary is hyperplastic due to accumulation of proliferating progenitors, whereas overexpression of p57(Kip2) leads to hypoplasia. p57(Kip2)-dependent cell cycle exit is not required for differentiation, and conversely, blockade of cell differentiation, as achieved in Tpit(-/-) pituitaries, does not prevent cell cycle exit but rather leads to accumulation of p57(Kip2)-positive precursors. Upon differentiation, p57(Kip2) is replaced by p27(Kip1). Accordingly, proliferating differentiated cells are readily detected in p27(Kip1-/-) pituitaries but not in wild-type or p57(Kip2-/-) pituitaries. Strikingly, all cells of p57(Kip2-/-); p27(Kip1-/-) pituitaries are proliferative. Thus, during normal development, progenitor cell cycle exit is controlled by p57(Kip2) followed by p27(Kip1) in differentiated cells; these sequential actions, taken together with different pituitary outcomes of their loss of function, suggest hierarchical controls of the cell cycle that are independent of differentiation.

In the adult retina, nerve growth factor (NGF) hinds to TrkA (expressed by neurons) and p75(NTR) (expressed by Muller glia), but fails to promote the survival of axotomized retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). We addressed the functional role of TrkA and p75(NTR) in this lack of Of survival by using peptidomimetic agonistic or antagonistic ligands specific for each receptor. While administration of exogenous NGF failed to rescue axotomized RGCs, administration of selective TrkA agonists led to robust. neuroprotection. Surprisingly, we found a remarkable survival of axotomized RGCs following pharmacological inhibition of p75(NTR) or in p75(NTR) knockout mice. Combination of NGF or TkA agonists with p75(NTR) antagonists further potentiated RGC neuroprotection in vivo, an effect that was greater than each treatment alone. NGF can therefore be neuroprotective when acting oil neuronal TrkA receptors but engagement of p75(NTR) on glial cells antagonizes this effect. Our data reveal a novel mechanism by which p75(NTR) expressed on retinal glia can profoundly influence neuronal survival. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Combinations of DEAD box proteins distinguish distinct types of RNA: Protein complexes in neurons	MOLECULAR AND CELLULAR NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							TAU-MESSENGER-RNA; P-BODIES; TRANSLATION; PARTICLES; TRANSPORT; HELICASES; GRANULES; CULTURE	Transport of mRNAs to axons and dendrites in neurons is important for growth, polarization and plasticity. Recent proteomic Studies in neurons have identified a number of DEAD box proteins as components of RNA granules. Using DEAD box proteins as markers, we have defined classes of RNA:protein structures present in neurons. In particular, we demonstrate that the conjunction of DEAD box I and DEAD box 3 identifies a motile ribosome-containing RNA granule present in both axons and dendrites that is similar to the biochemically isolated RNA granule. Conjunction of DEAD box I and the novel protein CGI-99 defines a distinct complex in neurons. Attempts to define a P-body like Structure with expression of DEAD box 6 and decapping enzymes suggest that this structure may be more complex in neuronal processes than in other compartments. These studies hint at a great complexity in RNA transport and storage in neuronal processes. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

This study demonstrates the varied toxicity of a selected type of nanoparticle, cadmium telluride quantum dots (QDs), in three increasingly complex cell models of the peripheral nervous system. Materials & methods: QD-induced cytotoxicity was assessed via cell viability assays and biomarkers of subcellular damage in PC12 cells and mixed primary dispersed dorsal root ganglia (DRG) cultures. Morphological analysis of neurite outgrowth was used to determine the viability of axotomized DRG explant cultures. Results & discussion: Cadmium telluride QDs and their core metals exert different degrees of toxicity in the three cell models, the primary dispersed DRGs being the most susceptible. alpha-lipoic acid is an effective, multimodal, cytoprotective agent that can act as an antioxidant, metal chelator and QD-surface modifier in these cell systems. Conclusion: Complex multicellular model systems, along with homogenous cell models, should be utilized in standard screening and monitoring procedures for evaluating nanomaterial safety.

Valproic acid enhances protein L-isoaspartyl methyltransferase expression by stimulating extracellular signal-regulated kinase signaling pathway	NEUROPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Protein L-isoaspartyl methyltransferase; Valproic acid; Epilepsy; ERK1/2 signaling pathway; RSK-1; GSK-3; beta-catenin	GLYCOGEN-SYNTHASE KINASE-3-BETA; BETA-CATENIN; SYNAPTIC-TRANSMISSION; UP-REGULATION; INACTIVATION; GROWTH; MICE; ACTIVATION; CELLS; PHOSPHORYLATION	Proteins are susceptible to various non-enzymatic post-translational modifications occurring during aging and in certain pathological states. The protein L-isoaspartyl methyltransferase (PIMT) is an enzyme that recognizes and repairs the abnormal L-isoaspartyl residues in proteins. Recently, we reported that PIMT expression was stimulated by the anti-epileptic drug valproic acid and that this was mediated through the glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3)/beta-catenin pathway. In this study, to gain further insights into which of the signaling pathways activated by valproic acid regulate PIMT abundance, astrocytoma U-87 MG and neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells were treated with this drug to investigate the possible involvement of the extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway in PIMT induction. Valproic acid increased ERK1/2 phosphorylation on Thr202/Tyr204 and Thr185/Tyr187, respectively. Pharmacological inhibitors against the kinases Src, c-Raf, MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 abolished the ERK1/2 phosphorylation stimulated by valproic acid, thus preventing PIMT induction by the drug. Furthermore, MEK1/2 inhibition with U0126 blocked the higher phosphorylation of RSK-1 on Thr359/Ser363 and of GSK-3 beta on Ser9 as well as the increased expression of RSK-1, beta-catenin and PIMT upon treatment with valproic acid. RSK-1 knockdown by interfering RNA abrogated the increased expression of RSK-1, beta-catenin and PIMT as well as the induced phosphorylation of RSK-1 and GSK-3 beta due to valproic acid. Thus, our findings demonstrated that PIMT up-regulation by valproic acid required the activation of the ERK signaling pathway including RSK-1 the latter being responsible for inactivating GSK-3 and subsequently leading to beta-catenin stabilization.

A randomized, placebo-controlled trial of oxycodone and of gabapentin for acute pain in herpes zoster	PAIN			English	Article						Herpes zoster; Acute pain; Randomized clinical trial; Oxycodone; Gabapentin; Postherpetic neuralgia	QUALITY-OF-LIFE; POSTHERPETIC NEURALGIA; CLINICAL-TRIALS; IMMPACT RECOMMENDATIONS; NEUROPATHIC PAIN; OLDER-ADULTS; VARICELLA; SHINGLES; VACCINE; EPIDEMIOLOGY	Although acute pain in patients with herpes zoster can be severe and has a Substantial impact on health-related quality of life, there have. been no randomized clinical trials of oral medications specifically for its ongoing treatment. A randomized clinical trial was conducted in which 87 subjects >= 50 years of age with herpes zoster within 6 calendar days of rash onset and with worst pain in the past 24 h >= 3 on a 0-10 rating scale initiated 7 clays of treatment with famciclovir in combination with 28 days of treatment with either controlled-release (CR) oxycodone, gabapentin, or placebo. Subjects were evaluated for adverse effects of treatment, acute pain, and health-related quality of life. The results showed that CR-oxycodone and gabapentin were generally safe and were associated with adverse events that reflect well-known effects of these medications. Discontinuing participation in the trial, primarily associated with constipation, occurred more frequently in subjects randomized to CR-oxycodone (27.6%) compared with placebo (6.9%). Treatment with CR-oxycodone reduced the mean worst pain over days 1-8 (p = 0.01) and days 1 - 14 (p = 0.02) relative to placebo but not throughout the entire 28-day treatment period as pain resolved in most subjects. Gabapentin did not provide significantly greater pain relief than placebo, although the data for the first week were consistent with a modest benefit. By demonstrating that CR-oxycodone is safe, generally adequately tolerated, and appears to have efficacy for relieving acute pain, the results of this clinical trial provide a foundation for evidence-based treatment for acute pain in herpes zoster.

Despite these efforts, little improvement has occurred, and we postulate that focused attention to public policy and cost implications of systemic change is required to create positive pain-related outcomes. Our goal was to outline feasible and cost-effective clinical and public policy recommendations designed to address the undermanagement of pain in LTC facilities. We arranged a 2-day consensus meeting of prominent United States and Canadian pain and public policy experts. An initial document describing the problem of pain undermanagement in LTC was developed and circulated prior to the meeting. Participants were also asked to respond to a list of relevant questions before arriving. Following formal presentations of a variety of proposals and extensive discussion among clinicians and policy experts, a set of recommendations was developed. We outline key elements of a transformational model of pain management in LTC for the United States and Canada. Consistent with previously formulated clinical guidelines but with attention to readily implementable public policy change in both countries, this transformational model of LTC has important implications for LTC managers and policy makers as well as major quality of life implications for LTC residents.

However, the mechanisms through which metabolic manipulations intercede the rewarding effects of drug reward are unknown. Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is thought to be critically involved in the regulation of energy balance. Central administration of NPY induces feeding in sated animals, and importantly, is reported to increase the rewarding properties of food. NPY has also been shown to be involved in drug-related behavior. We have recently demonstrated that NPY injections augmented on-going heroin self-administration and induced a reinstatement of heroin seeking. The present study sought to support and expand our previous finding on NPY's role in addictive drugs-related behaviors by examining the effects of NPY on cocaine-induced locomotor hyperactivity and cocaine self-administration. In Experiment 1, rats received NPY injections (0.0, 2.5, 5.0 mu g/rat, ICV), followed by cocaine administration (0.0, 1.0, 5.0, and 10.0 mg/kg, IP) and their locomotor activity was monitored over 90 min. In Experiment 2, rats were trained to self-administer cocaine (0.50 mg/kg/infusion) during one 3-h session per day for 12 days. Once trained, NPY (0.0, 4.0, 10.0 mu g/rat, ICV) was administered 15 min prior to the self-administration session. Results revealed that NPY injections augmented cocaine-induced hyperactivity and moderately increased cocaine self-administration. Together with our previous findings, these results suggest that NPY is involved, albeit to a limited extent, in the augmenting effect of food deprivation on drug-related behaviors.

This communication was designed to study the relationship between PVN and endogenous opiate system in the spinal cord in the rat. The results showed that in both the thoracic and the lumber spinal cord, microinjection of 100 ng L-glutamate sodium into PVN could increase leucine-enkephalin (L-Ek), beta-endorphin (beta-Ep), dynorphinA(1-13) (DynA(1-13)) concentrations and PVN cauterization decreased L-Ek and beta-Ep concentrations. Pretreatment of the spinal cord with 5 mu g naloxone, an opiate receptor antagonist could partly reverse the analgesia induced by microinjection of 100 ng L-glutamate sodium into PVN. The data suggested that PVN analgesia might be involved in the endogenous opiate peptide system in the spinal cord independently. (c) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Individuals with atypical depression (AD) are particularly responsive to treatment with MAO inhibitors (MAOIs). Biomarker tests are essential for prompt diagnosis of AD, and to identify those with an altered brain neurotransmitter metabolism who may selectively respond to MAOI therapy. Methods In a sample of 118 Scandinavian patients with treatment-resistant depression who are naive to MAOI therapy, we investigated the associations between a common MAOA functional promoter polymorphism (MAOA-uVNTR), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) neurotransmitter metabolites, and AD susceptibility. The metabolites for dopamine (homovanillic acid, HVA), serotonin (5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid) and noradrenaline (3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol) were measured in the CSF. Results AD was associated with the female sex and a higher HVA in CSF (P=0.008). The carriers of the MAOA-uVNTR short allele were significantly overrepresented among women with AD (P=0.005; odds ratio=4.76; 95% confidence interval = 1.5-13.1; statistical power = 80.0%). Moreover, the MAOA-uVNTR genotype significantly influenced the HVA concentration (P=0.01) and showed a strong trend in relation to 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid concentration (P=0.057) in women. The mediational statistical analyses showed the CSF-HVA concentration as a key driver of the relationship between MAOA-uVNTR genotype and AD. Conclusion The association of the MAOA-uVNTR with both susceptibility to AD and dopamine metabolite (HVA) concentration lends further biological plausibility for high MAO-A enzyme activity as a mechanistic factor for genetic predisposition to AD through altered dopamine turnover. Our observations provide new evidence on the in-vivo functional significance of the MAOA-uVNTR short allele as a high-activity variant.

CDF Collaboration	Top quark mass measurement in the lepton plus jets channel using a modified matrix element method	PHYSICAL REVIEW D			English	Article							PARTON DISTRIBUTIONS; DETECTOR; PHYSICS	We report a measurement of the top quark mass, m(t), obtained from p(p)over bar collisions at root s=1.96 TeV at the Fermilab Tevatron using the CDF II detector. We analyze a sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 1.9 fb(-1). We select events with an electron or muon, large missing transverse energy, and exactly four high-energy jets in the central region of the detector, at least one of which is tagged as coming from a b quark. We calculate a signal likelihood using a matrix element integration method, where the matrix element is modified by using effective propagators to take into account assumptions on event kinematics. Our event likelihood is a function of m(t) and a parameter JES (jet energy scale) that determines in situ the calibration of the jet energies. We use a neural network discriminant to distinguish signal from background events. We also apply a cut on the peak value of each event likelihood curve to reduce the contribution of background and badly reconstructed events. Using the 318 events that pass all selection criteria, we find m(t)=172.7 +/- 1.8(stat+JES)+/- 1.2(syst) GeV/c(2).	[Blair, R. E.; Byrum, K. L.; LeCompte, T.; Nodulman, L.; Proudfoot, J.; Wagner, R.

Re-expression of Locomotor Function After Partial Spinal Cord Injury	PHYSIOLOGY			English	Review							MEDULLARY RETICULAR-FORMATION; INTACT UNANESTHETIZED CAT; RETICULOSPINAL NEURONAL-ACTIVITY; CENTRAL PATTERN GENERATOR; OVERGROUND LOCOMOTION; NEONATAL-RAT; ADULT-RAT; SENSORIMOTOR INTERACTIONS; TREADMILL LOCOMOTION; UNRESTRAINED WALKING	After a complete spinal section, quadruped mammals (cats, rats, and mice) can generally regain hindlimb locomotion on a treadmill because the spinal cord below the lesion can express locomotion through a neural circuitry termed the central pattern generator (CPG). In this review, we propose that the spinal CPG also plays a crucial role in the locomotor recovery after incomplete spinal cord injury.

Methods: All children diagnosed with infantile spasms between 1990 and 2003 at our institution were included. Charts were reviewed for the presence or absence of a defined aetiology/association, response to treatment, long-term epileptic and cognitive outcome. Results: 80 out of 95 children are included in this review. 50 children (63%) had symptomatic spasms with disorders of cortical development being the most frequent cause followed by neonatal injury and tuberous sclerosis. Symptomatic children with developmental brain lesions responded at a rate of 54% to vigabatrin versus 62% for ACTH/prednisone, while other symptomatic aetiologies 83% responded to vigabatrin versus 63% for ACFH/prednisone. Cryptogenic spasms responded at a similar rate to both drugs. Other than children with cryptogenic spasms, very few went on to develop normally. Our results are however biased by on average more than 30 days of delay to diagnosis. None of our children developed Lennox-Gastaut syndrome but a number developed severe epilepsy with multifocal spikes. Discussion: The aetiology and prognosis of infantile spasms is evolving. To improve Outcome, we need to reduce the delay to diagnosis and develop prospective double-blind randomized clinical trials looking at not only the epileptic outcome but also cognitive outcome of these children.

METHODS A total of 54 female rats were studied. Of the 54 rats, 6 served as normal controls, and 48 underwent T10 spinal cord transection (SCT). Of the latter 48 rats, 12 were paraplegic controls, and the remaining 36 rats were divided into 3 equal subgroups that received LEV by way of a subcutaneous osmotic minipump at a dose of 17, 54, and 108 mg/kg daily, respectively. The paraplegic control and treatment groups were further subdivided (n = 6), and cystometry was performed at 3 and 4 weeks after SCT, respectively. RESULTS All paraplegic controls developed NDO, with spontaneous contractions. At 3 and 4 weeks after SCT, the mean frequency of the contractions was 1.6 +/- 0.3/min and 1.7 +/- 0.2/min. The contraction amplitude and bladder capacity were not significantly different. After I week of LEV treatment, these urodynamic parameters improved significantly in a dose-dependent manner, and the changes were more striking at 2 weeks. At a LEV dosage of 17, 54, and 108 mg/kg, respectively, the NDO frequency increased from 1.7 +/- 0.3 to 0.7 +/- 0.2 contractions/min (P = .01), 0.48 +/- 0.16 contractions/min (P = .009), and 0.5 +/- 0.17 contractions/min (P = .01). The bladder capacity increased from 0.51 +/- 0.1 mL to 1.5 +/- 0.2 mL (P = .0001), 2.5 +/- 1.7 mL (P = .006), and 2.6 +/- 0.3 mL (P = .0003), and the micturition pressure improved from 105.8 +/- 6.9 to 73.8 +/- 6.8 cm H(2)O (P =.01), 58.6 +/- 8.9 cm H(2)O (P = .006), and 49.7 +/- 8.9 cm H(2)O (P = .002). CONCLUSIONS The results of our study have shown that LEV is an effective treatment of NDO after SCT in rats. It might prove to be a novel, alternative therapeutic approach to NDO. The follow-up of these experimental results with a clinical trial is warranted. UROLOGY 73: 922-927, 2009. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Carotid Artery Angioplasty and Stenting: Introduction of a New Technique Into an Established Vascular Surgery Center	VASCULAR AND ENDOVASCULAR SURGERY			English	Article						carotid artery stenting; carotid endarterectomy; restenosis; stroke; high risk	HIGH-RISK PATIENTS; ENDARTERECTOMY; STENOSIS; PLACEMENT	Background: The aim of this study was to review our initial experience with the introduction of carotid artery angioplasty and stenting as a treatment for carotid stenosis in high-risk patients and compare clinical outcomes to carotid endarterectomy patients treated over the same time period at our center. Methods: A total of 265 carotid revascularization procedures (45 carotid artery angioplasty and stenting and 220 carotid endarterectomy) were performed over 3 years period. In the carotid artery angioplasty and stenting group, 93% were at high risk according to the current reporting standards. Death, neurological events, and restenosis rates were compared at 30 days and at most recent follow-up. Results: Mean follow-up for all patients was 18 months (range 0-48 months). Carotid artery angioplasty and stenting group-had higher cardiac risk than carotid endarterectomy group (13% vs 2%, P < .05. High-risk carotid lesions were present in 67% of carotid artery angioplasty and stenting patients. There was a tendency toward higher restenosis rate in carotid artery angioplasty and stenting than in carotid endarterectomy patients (35% vs 15%, P = .06). Combined stroke and death was higher in the carotid stenting group (4% and 9%) compared to the carotid endarterectomy group (0.5% and 0.5%) at 30 days and at late follow-up, respectively (P = .04 and .00). Conclusion: Restenosis and stroke were observed more frequently in our initial experience in patients undergoing carotid artery angioplasty and stenting compared with carotid endarterectomy patients during the same time period. These differences disappeared in high-risk patients. Further studies, to evaluate the effect of the learning curve on early results as well as follow-up for intermediate and long-term durability of carotid artery angioplasty and stenting in high-risk patients, are required.

J	Chu-Shore, CJ; Major, P; Montenegro, M; Thiele, E				Chu-Shore, Catherine J.; Major, Philippe; Montenegro, Maria; Thiele, Elizabeth			Cyst-like tubers are associated with TSC2 and epilepsy in tuberous sclerosis complex	NEUROLOGY			English	Article							PROGNOSTIC-SIGNIFICANCE; MUTATIONAL ANALYSIS; SURGICAL-TREATMENT; CORTICAL TUBERS; PATHOGENESIS; IMPAIRMENT; SEVERITY; SURGERY; LESIONS; COUNT	Background: Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a genetic condition characterized by the presence of hamartomatous lesions in multiple organs, including tubers in the brain. The majority of patients with TSC have epilepsy. Some cortical tubers are epileptic foci, while others appear to be physiologically quiescent. It is unknown whether variations in tuber morphology may account for this difference. The objectives of this study were to determine the frequency of cyst-like tubers in patients with TSC, whether cyst-like tubers correlate with TSC genotype, and whether cyst-like cortical tubers are associated with a history of infantile spasms, epilepsy, or refractory epilepsy. Methods: A retrospective chart review was performed of 173 patients with TSC. MRI images were evaluated for the presence of at least one cyst-like cortical tuber. Patient charts were then reviewed for genetic mutation, a history of infantile spasms, epilepsy, and epilepsy refractory to more than three medications. Results: A total of 46% of patients had at least one cyst-like cortical tuber present on neuroimaging. Patients with a TSC2 mutation were more likely to have a cyst-like tuber than patients with TSC1 mutation (p = 0.002) or patients with no mutation identified (p = 0.039). Patients with at least one cyst-like cortical tuber were more likely to have a history of infantile spasms (p = 0.00005), epilepsy (p = 0.0038), and refractory epilepsy (p = 0.0007) than patients without a cyst-like cortical tuber. Conclusion: Cyst-like cortical tubers are strongly associated with TSC2 gene mutation and a more aggressive seizure phenotype in patients with tuberous sclerosis complex.

ARCHITECTONIC MAPPING OF THE MEDIAL REGION OF THE HUMAN ORBITOFRONTAL CORTEX BY DENSITY PROFILES	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Review						human; cytoarchitecture; orbitofrontal cortex; areal density; density profiles	COMPARATIVE CYTOARCHITECTONIC ANALYSIS; CORTICOCORTICAL CONNECTION PATTERNS; PREFRONTAL CORTICAL PROJECTIONS; QUANTITATIVE APPROACH; MACAQUE MONKEYS; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; RHESUS-MONKEY; AREAL PATTERN; FRONTAL-CORTEX; INTERINDIVIDUAL VARIABILITY	The study of architectonic differentiation in the cortex is advanced by the articulation of objective definitions based on clear features of the cortical architecture. We adopted areal density profiles as a means of sampling the cortex. On the profiles, we isolated and quantified the density of individual cortical layers. These features may serve as criteria in objective definitions in a way that builds on qualitative observations found in the classical literature. A preprocessing procedure was introduced to overcome artefacts in the density profiles caused by the partial overlap of neighboring neuronal layers and cortical folding. We applied this method to the medial half of the orbital frontal cortex in specimens drawn from 10 human postmortem brain hemispheres. The measurements successfully confirmed the existence of several qualitatively observed areas (architectonic areas 14c, 14r, 11m, 11 and 13). The selection of specific sampling parameters was justified on the basis of simultaneous measurements of the cortical morphology which demonstrate its influence on the appearance of the cortical layers. We also examined the robustness of the measuring procedure by analyzing the outcome of varying systematically the sampling parameters. We describe here a novel method of sampling the cortex for architectonic analysis and demonstrate its application on histological sections obtained from the medial half of the human orbitofrontal cortex.

Disturbance of homeostasis not only occurs at the site of injury but also extends to the spinal cord and brain involving various types of cells. Emerging data implicate neuroimmune interaction in the initiation and maintenance of chronic pain hypersensitivity. Results: In this study, we sought to investigate the effects of TGF-beta 1, a potent anti-inflammatory cytokine, in alleviating nerve injury-induced neuropathic pain in rats. By using a well established neuropathic pain animal model (partial ligation of the sciatic nerve), we demonstrated that intrathecal infusion of recombinant TGF-beta 1 significantly attenuated nerve injury-induced neuropathic pain. TGF-beta 1 treatment not only prevents development of neuropathic pain following nerve injury, but also reverses previously established neuropathic pain conditions. The biological outcomes of TGF-beta 1 in this context are attributed to its pleiotropic effects. It inhibits peripheral nerve injury-induced spinal microgliosis, spinal microglial and astrocytic activation, and exhibits a powerful neuroprotective effect by preventing the induction of ATF3(+) neurons following nerve ligation, consequently reducing the expression of chemokine MCP-1 in damaged neurons. TGF-beta 1 treatment also suppresses nerve injury-induced inflammatory response in the spinal cord, as revealed by a reduction in cytokine expression. Conclusion: Our findings revealed that TGF-beta 1 is effective in the treatment of neuropathic by targeting both neurons and glial cells. We suggest that therapeutic agents such as TGF-beta 1 having multipotent effects on different types of cells could work in synergy to regain homeostasis in local spinal cord microenvironments, therefore contributing to attenuate neuropathic pain.

The latter effect spares white matter at the injury site and improves locomotion. The aim of this study was to confirm the neuroprotective efficacy of atorvastatin as well as its early action in limiting apoptosis with its administration post-SCI. Female Sprague-Dawley rats received an intra peritoneal injection of: (1) statin/saline (5 mg/kg) at 2 h after the contusion injury; (2) physiological saline at 2 h post-SCI; or (3) physiological saline without injury. Statin-treated rats showed significant (p < 0.05) improvement in locomotion at week 4 post-SCI compared to vehicle-treated animals. Explaining this outcome, caspase-3 activity decreased by 50% (p<0.05), and the histological TUNEL method revealed a decrease of approximately 20% in apoptotic cells at the injury site (p < 0.01) at 4 h post-SCI in atorvastatin-treated rats in comparison to vehicle-treated controls. These data demonstrate that atorvastatin is effective after experimental spinal cord contusion injury in preventing early apoptosis at the injury site within 2 h post-administration.

In animal models of diabetes, it contributes to pain polyneuropathy. This study aims at defining the cellular localization of B1R in thoracic spinal cord of type 1 diabetic rats by confocal microscopy with the use of a fluorescent agonist, [N alpha-Bodipy]-des-Arg(9)-BK (BdABK) and selective antibodies. Methods: Diabetes was induced by streptozotocin (STZ; 65 mg/kg, i.p.). Four days post-STZ treatment, B1R expression was confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR and autoradiography. The B1R selectivity of BdABK was determined by assessing its ability to displace B1R [I-125]-HPP-desArg(10)-Hoe 140 and B2R [I-125]-HPP-Hoe 140 radioligands. The in vivo activity of BdABK was also evaluated on thermal hyperalgesia. Results: R was increased by 18-fold (mRNA) and 2.7-fold (binding sites) in the thoracic spinal cord of STZ-treated rats when compared to control. BdABK failed to displace the B2R radioligand but displaced the B1R radioligand (IC50 = 5.3 nM). In comparison, IC50 values of B1R selective antagonist R-715 and B1R agonist des-Arg(9)-BK were 4.3 nM and 19 nM, respectively. Intraperitoneal BdABK and des-Arg(9)-BK elicited dose-dependent thermal hyperalgesia in STZ-treated rats but not in control rats. The B1R fluorescent agonist was co-localized with immunomarkers of microglia, astrocytes and sensory C fibers in the spinal cord of STZ-treated rats. Conclusion: The induction and up-regulation of B1R in glial and sensory cells of the spinal cord in STZ-diabetic rats reinforce the idea that kinin B1R is an important target for drug development in pain processes.

With corticothalamic excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) evoked by 2.5- to 20-Hz trains, we found Q (estimated using various corrections of variance/mean ratios) to be unchanged during rundown and close to the size of stimulus-evoked "miniatures". Except for covariances, results were compatible with a depletion model, according to which incomplete "refill" after probabilistic quantal release entails release-site "emptying". For five neurons with 20 train repetitions at each frequency, there was little between-neuron variation of rundown; pool-refill rate increased with stimulus frequency and evolved during rundown. Covariances did not fit the depletion model or theoretical alternatives, being excessively negative for adjacent EPSCs early in trains, absent at equilibrium, and anomalously positive for some nonadjacent EPSCs. The anomalous covariances were unaltered during pharmacological blockade of receptor desensitization and saturation. These findings suggest that pool-refill rate and release probability at each release site are continually modulated by antecedent outputs in its neighborhood, possibly via feedback mechanisms. In all data sets, sampling errors for between-train variances were much less than theoretical, warranting reconsideration of the probabilistic nature of quantal transmitter release.

Nuclear Factor kappa B Signaling Regulates Neuronal Morphology and Cocaine Reward	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							INDUCED STRUCTURAL PLASTICITY; MESOLIMBIC DOPAMINE SYSTEM; LONG-TERM POTENTIATION; BEHAVIORAL PLASTICITY; HIPPOCAMPAL-NEURONS; EMOTIONAL STIMULI; GENE-EXPRESSION; CELL-SURVIVAL; ACCUMBENS; INCREASES	Although chronic cocaine-induced changes in dendritic spines on nucleus accumbens (NAc) neurons have been correlated with behavioral sensitization, the molecular pathways governing these structural changes, and their resulting behavioral effects, are poorly understood. The transcription factor, nuclear factor kappa B (NF kappa B), is rapidly activated by diverse stimuli and regulates expression of many genes known to maintain cell structure. Therefore, we evaluated the role of NF kappa B in regulating cocaine-induced dendritic spine changes on medium spiny neurons of the NAc and the rewarding effects of cocaine. We show that chronic cocaine induces NF kappa B-dependent transcription in the NAc of NF kappa B-Lac transgenic mice. This induction of NF kappa B activity is accompanied by increased expression of several NF kappa B genes, the promoters of which show chromatin modifications after chronic cocaine exposure consistent with their transcriptional activation. To study the functional significance of this induction, we used viral-mediated gene transfer to express either a constitutively active or dominant-negative mutant of Inhibitor of kappa B kinase (IKKca or IKKdn), which normally activates NF kappa B signaling, in the NAc. We found that activation of NF kappa B by IKKca increases the number of dendritic spines on NAc neurons, whereas inhibition of NF kappa B by IKKdn decreases basal dendritic spine number and blocks the increase in dendritic spines after chronic cocaine. Moreover, inhibition of NF kappa B blocks the rewarding effects of cocaine and the ability of previous cocaine exposure to increase an animal's preference for cocaine. Together, these studies establish a direct role for NF kappa B pathways in the NAc to regulate structural and behavioral plasticity to cocaine.

NEUROLOGY			English	Article							TELEPHONE DIAGNOSTIC INTERVIEW; DIABETIC-NEUROPATHY; POLYNEUROPATHY; VALIDATION; SEVERITY; IRON	Objective: Associations between peripheral neuropathy and restless legs syndrome (RLS) have been described, but have not been consistently reproduced. If RLS prevalence is truly increased by neuropathy, this has important implications for RLS pathophysiology. Methods: In a case-control design, 245 patients with peripheral neuropathy and 245 age-and sex-matched controls were screened for RLS using a standardized phone questionnaire based on international RLS diagnostic criteria. All persons who answered yes to three of four criteria were considered screen-positive. All screen-positive patients underwent a confirmatory diagnostic evaluation by a movement disorders specialist blinded to the neuropathy status of the patient. RLS prevalence was calculated and compared using Fisher exact test. Results: A total of 65 (26.5%) patients with neuropathy screened positive compared to 25 (10.2%) controls (p < 0.0001). However, the diagnosis was confirmed in only 46% of screen-positive patients with neuropathy, vs 80% of controls (p = 0.005). Cramps and paresthesia without true diurnal variation or rest exacerbation were the commonest causes of false-positive screens. After diagnostic confirmation, the overall prevalence of RLS did not differ between neuropathy patients and controls (12.2% vs 8.2%, p = 0.14). However, when classified by etiology, RLS was found in 14/72 (19.4%) patients with hereditary neuropathy, a prevalence higher than found in controls (p = 0.016) and acquired neuropathy (9.2%, p = 0.033). Among patients with neuropathy, those with RLS more commonly had a family history of RLS (37% vs 15%, p = 0.007) and were younger (49.9 vs 61.4, p = 0.0003). Conclusions: Restless legs syndrome is more prevalent among patients with hereditary neuropathy, but not in those with acquired neuropathies.

High-frequency oscillations mirror disease activity in patients with epilepsy	NEUROLOGY			English	Article							TEMPORAL-LOBE EPILEPSY; ENTORHINAL CORTEX; NEOCORTICAL EPILEPSY; INTERICTAL SPIKES; INTRACEREBRAL EEG; SUBDURAL EEG; 100-500 HZ; SEIZURES; BRAIN; HIPPOCAMPUS	Objective: High-frequency oscillations (HFOs) can be recorded in epileptic patients with clinical intracranial EEG. HFOs have been associated with seizure genesis because they occur in the seizure focus and during seizure onset. HFOs are also found interictally, partly co-occurring with epileptic spikes. We studied how HFOs are influenced by antiepileptic medication and seizure occurrence, to improve understanding of the pathophysiology and clinical meaning of HFOs. Methods: Intracerebral depth EEG was partly sampled at 2,000 Hz in 42 patients with intractable focal epilepsy. Patients with five or more usable nights of recording were selected. A sample of slow-wave sleep from each night was analyzed, and HFOs (ripples: 80-250 Hz, fast ripples: 250-500 Hz) and spikes were identified on all artifact-free channels. The HFOs and spikes were compared before and after seizures with stable medication dose and during medication reduction with no intervening seizures. Results: Twelve patients with five to eight nights were included. After seizures, there was an increase in spikes, whereas HFO rates remained the same. Medication reduction was followed by an increase in HFO rates and mean duration. Conclusions: Contrary to spikes, high-frequency oscillations (HFOs) do not increase after seizures, but do so after medication reduction, similarly to seizures. This implies that spikes and HFOs have different pathophysiologic mechanisms and that HFOs are more tightly linked to seizures than spikes. HFOs seem to play an important role in seizure genesis and can be a useful clinical marker for disease activity.

VARIATIONS IN EXCITATORY AND INHIBITORY POSTSYNAPTIC PROTEIN CONTENT IN RAT CEREBRAL CORTEX WITH RESPECT TO AGING AND COGNITIVE STATUS	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						brain aging; excitatory; inhibitory; postsynaptic proteins; cognitive impairment	GAMMA-AMINOBUTYRIC-ACID; RECEPTOR SUBUNIT EXPRESSION; RECOMBINANT NMDA RECEPTORS; CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; GABA(A) RECEPTORS; SYNAPSE FORMATION; DEVELOPMENTAL REGULATION; HYPOXIC/ISCHEMIC INJURY; REGIONAL SUSCEPTIBILITY; GLUTAMATERGIC SYNAPSES	Age-related cognitive impairments are associated with structural and functional changes in the cerebral cortex. We have previously demonstrated in the rat that excitatory and inhibitory pre- and postsynaptic changes occur with respect to age and cognitive status; however, in aged cognitively impaired animals, we have shown a significant imbalance in postsynaptic markers of excitatory versus inhibitory synapses, using markers of excitatory versus inhibitory neurotransmitter-related scaffolding proteins [postsynaptic density-95 (PSD95)/synapse associated protein-90 (SAP90) and gephyrin, respectively]. The present study focuses on whether the expression of various excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic proteins is affected by ageing and cognitive status. Thus, aged animals were segregated into aged cognitively impaired (Al) and aged cognitively unimpaired (AU) groups using the Morris water maze. We applied Western immunoblotting to reveal the expression patterns of a number of relevant excitatory and inhibitory receptors in the prefrontal and parietal cortices of young (Y), AU and Al animals, and performed semi-quantitative analyses to statistically tabulate changes among the three animal groups. A significant increase in the inhibitory postsynaptic scaffold protein, gephyrin, was observed in the parietal cortex of Al animals. Similarly, an increase in GABA(A) receptor subunit alpha 1 was observed in the parietal cortex of Al animals. An increase in the excitatory N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor subunit N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor 1 expression was observed in the parietal cortex of Al animals, whereas a significant decrease in AMPA receptor subunit glutamate receptor 2 expression was found in the prefrontal cortex of Al animals. Finally, the excitatory, postsynaptic neuronal cell-adhesion receptor, neuroligin-1, was found to be significantly increased in both the prefrontal and parietal cortical areas of Al animals.

Sex differences in corticolimbic dopamine and serotonin systems in the rat and the effect of postnatal handling	PROGRESS IN NEURO-PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY & BIOLOGICAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Review						Dopamine; Gender; Handling; Lateralization; Serotonin; Stress	OVARIAN-STEROID REGULATION; ELEVATED PLUS-MAZE; BRAIN CORTICOSTEROID RECEPTORS; CORTICOTROPIN-RELEASING-FACTOR; CHRONIC RESTRAINT STRESS; MEDIAN RAPHE NUCLEUS; FEMALE RATS; ESTROUS-CYCLE; GENDER-DIFFERENCES; PREFRONTAL CORTEX	Stress-related psychopathology is particularly prevalent in women, although the neurobiological reason(s) for this are unclear. Dopamine (DA) and serotonin (5-HT) systems however, are known to play important adaptive roles in stress and emotion regulation. The aims of the present study included examination of sex differences in stress-related behaviour and neuroendocrine function as well as post mortem neurochemistry, with the main hypothesis that corticolimbic DA and 5-HT systems would show greater functional activity in males than females. Long-Evans rats of both sexes were employed. Additional factors incorporated included differential postnatal experience (handled vs. nonhandled) and adult mild stress experience (acute vs. repeated (5) restraint). Regional neurochemistry measures were conducted separately for left and right hemispheres. Behaviourally, females showed more exploratory behaviour than males in the elevated plus maze and an openfield/holeboard apparatus. Females also exhibited significantly higher levels of adrenocorticotrophic hormone and corticosterone at all time points in response to restraint stress than males across treatment conditions, although both sexes showed similar habituation in stress-induced ACTH activation with repeated mild stress. Neurochemically, females had significantly higher levels of DA (in ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), insular cortex and n. accumbens) and 5-HT (in vmPFC, amygdala, dorsal hippocampus and insula) than males. In contrast, males had higher levels of the DA metabolite DOPAC or DOPAC/DA ratios than females in all five regions and higher levels of the 5-HT metabolite 5-HIAA or 5-HIAA/5-HT ratios in vmPFC, amygdala and insula, suggesting greater neurotransmitter utilization in males. Moreover, handling treatment induced a significant mate-specific upregulation of 5-HT metabolism in all regions except n. accumbens. Given the adaptive role of 5-HT and DAergic neurotransmission in stress and emotion regulation, the intrinsic sex differences we report in the functional status of these systems across conditions, may be highly relevant to the differential vulnerability to disorders of stress and emotion regulation.

Using a global Hopf bifurcation theorem for FDE due to Wu [Wu J. Symmetric functional differential equations and neural networks with memory. Trans Amer Math Soc 1998;350:4799-838], a group of sufficient conditions for this model to have multiple periodic solutions are obtained when the sum of delay's is sufficiently large.

How these factors interact together at the genetic and molecular level to coordinate this developmental process is poorly understood. We found that the Lhx2 and Pax6 transcription factors operate in a concerted manner during retinal development to promote transcriptional activation of the Six6 homeobox-gene in primitive and mature retinal progenitors. Lhx2 demarcates the presumptive retina field at the neural plate stage and Lhx2 inactivation delays initiation of Rx, Six3 and Pax6 expression in this domain. The later expressed Six6 is properly activated in the pituitary/hypothalamic axis of Lhx2(-/-) embryos, but expression fails to be initiated in the optic vesicle. Lhx2 and Pax6 associate with the chromatin at several regions of Six6 in vivo and cooperate for trans-activation of Six6 regulatory elements in vitro. In retinal progenitor/stem cells, both Lhx2 and Pax6 are genetically required for proper Six6 expression and forced co-expression of Lhx2 and Pax6 can synergistically trans-activate the Six6 locus. Our work reveals how two master regulators of eye development coordinate their action to sequentially promote tissue-specific transcriptional initiation and full activation of a retinal determinant gene.

MEIS1 intronic risk haplotype associated with restless legs syndrome affects its mRNA and protein expression levels	HUMAN MOLECULAR GENETICS			English	Article							GENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION; PERIODIC LIMB MOVEMENTS; COPY-NUMBER VARIATION; GENE-EXPRESSION; LINKAGE DISEQUILIBRIUM; MYELOID-LEUKEMIA; DISEASE; DELETION; SLEEP; POLYMORPHISMS	Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a common neurological disorder characterized by an irresistible urge to move the legs at night, which is often accompanied by unpleasant sensations. A recent genomewide association study identified an association between RLS and intronic markers from the MEIS1 gene. Comparative genomic analysis indicates that MEIS1 is the only gene encompassed in this evolutionarily conserved chromosomal segment, i.e. a conservation synteny block, from mammals to fish. We carried out a series of experiments to delineate the role of MEIS1 in RLS pathogenesis and the underlying genetic mechanism. We sequenced all 13 MEIS1 exons and their splice junctions in 285 RLS probands with confirmed clinical diagnosis and did not identify any causative coding or exon-intron junction mutations. We found no evidence of structural variation or disease-associated haplotype differential splicing. However, sequencing of conserved regions of MEIS1 introns 8 and 9 identified a novel single nucleotide polymorphism (C13B_2) significantly associated with RLS (allelic association, P = 1.81E-07). We detected a significant decrease in MEIS1 mRNA expression by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction in lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) and brain tissues from RLS patients homozygous for the intronic RLS risk haplotype, compared with those homozygous for the non-risk haplotype. Finally, we found significantly decreased MEIS1 protein levels in the same batch of LCLs and brain tissues from the homozygous carriers of the risk haplotype, compared with the homozygous non-carriers. Therefore, these data suggest that reduced expression of the MEIS1 gene, possibly through intronic cis-regulatory element(s), predisposes to RLS.

MOTEXAFIN GADOLINIUM COMBINED WITH PROMPT WHOLE BRAIN RADIOTHERAPY PROLONGS TIME TO NEUROLOGIC PROGRESSION IN NON-SMALL-CELL LUNG CANCER PATIENTS WITH BRAIN METASTASES: RESULTS OF A PHASE III TRIAL	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RADIATION ONCOLOGY BIOLOGY PHYSICS			English	Article						Brain metastases; Non-small-cell lung cancer; Whole brain radiotherapy; Motexafin gadolinium; Neurologic progression; Neurocognitive function	RANDOMIZED-TRIAL; END-POINTS; RADIATION; METABOLISM; EXPRESSION; TEXAPHYRIN; SURVIVAL	Purpose: To determine the efficacy of motexafin gadolinium (MGd) in combination with whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) for the treatment of brain metastases from non-small-cell lung cancer. Methods and Materials: In an international, randomized, Phase III study, patients with brain metastases from non-small-cell lung cancer were randomized to WBRT with or without MGd. The primary endpoint was the interval to neurologic progression, determined by a centralized Events Review Committee who was unaware of the treatment the patients had received. Results: Of 554 patients, 275 were randomized to WBRT and 279 to WBRT+MGd. Treatment with MGd was well tolerated, and 92% of the intended doses were administered. The most common MGd-related Grade 3+ adverse events included liver function abnormalities (5.5%), asthenia (4.0%), and hypertension (4%). MGd improved the interval to neurologic progression compared with WBRT alone (15 vs. 10 months; p = 0.12, hazard ratio [HR] = 0.78) and the interval to neurocognitive progression (p = 0.057, HR = 0.78). The WBRT patients required more salvage brain surgery or radiosurgery than did the WBRT+MGd patients (54 vs. 25 salvage procedures, p < 0.001). A statistically significant interaction between the geographic region and MGd treatment effect (which was in the prespecified analysis plan) and between treatment delay and MGd treatment effect was found. In North American patients, where treatment was more prompt, a statistically significant prolongation of the interval to neurologic progression, from 8.8 months for WBRT to 24.2 months for WBRT+MGd (p = 0.004, HR = 0.53), and the interval to neurocognitive progression (1) = 0.06, HR = 0.73) were observed. Conclusion: In the intent-to-treat analysis, MGd exhibited a favorable trend in neurologic outcomes. MGd significantly prolonged the interval to neurologic progression in non-small-cell lung cancer patients with brain metastases receiving prompt WBRT. The toxicity was acceptable.

On the Fisher's Z transformation of correlation random fields	STATISTICS & PROBABILITY LETTERS			English	Article							PRINCIPAL-COMPONENT ANALYSIS; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; BRAIN; SCHIZOPHRENIA; RECOGNITION; ACTIVATION; GEOMETRY; MODEL; MAPS; SETS	One of the most interesting problems studied in Random Field Theory (RFT) is to approximate the distribution of the maximum of a random field. This problem usually appears in a general hypothesis testing framework, where the statistics of interest are the maximum of a random field of a known distribution. In this paper, we use the RFT approach to compare two independent correlation random fields, R, and R(2). Our statistics of interest are the maximum of a random field G, resulting from the difference between the Fisher's Z transformation of R(1) and R(2), respectively. The Fisher's Z transformation guarantees a Gaussian distribution at each point of G but, unfortunately, G is not transformed into a Gaussian random field. Hence, standard results of RFT for Gaussian random fields are not longer available for G. We show here that the distribution of the maximum of G can still be approximated by the distribution of the maximum of a Gaussian random field, provided there is some correction by its spatial smoothness. Indeed, we present a general setting to obtain this correction. This is done by allowing different smoothness parameters for the components of G. Finally, the performance of our method is illustrated by means of both numerical simulations and real Electroencephalography data, recorded during a face recognition experimental paradigm.

A GRFa2/Prop1/Stem (GPS) Cell Niche in the Pituitary	PLOS ONE			English	Article								Background: The adult endocrine pituitary is known to host several hormone-producing cells regulating major physiological processes during life. Some candidates to progenitor/stem cells have been proposed. However, not much is known about pituitary cell renewal throughout life and its homeostatic regulation during specific physiological changes, such as puberty or pregnancy, or in pathological conditions such as tumor development. Principal Findings: We have identified in rodents and humans a niche of non-endocrine cells characterized by the expression of GFRa2, a Ret co-receptor for Neurturin. These cells also express b-Catenin and E-cadherin in an oriented manner suggesting a planar polarity organization for the niche. In addition, cells in the niche uniquely express the pituitary-specific transcription factor Prop1, as well as known progenitor/stem markers such as Sox2, Sox9 and Oct4. Half of these GPS (GFRa2/Prop1/Stem) cells express S-100 whereas surrounding elongated cells in contact with GPS cells express Vimentin. GFRa2+-cells form non-endocrine spheroids in culture. These spheroids can be differentiated to hormone-producing cells or neurons outlining the neuroectoderm potential of these progenitors. In vivo, GPSs cells display slow proliferation after birth, retain BrdU label and show long telomeres in its nuclei, indicating progenitor/stem cell properties in vivo. Significance: Our results suggest the presence in the adult pituitary of a specific niche of cells characterized by the expression of GFRa2, the pituitary-specific protein Prop1 and stem cell markers. These GPS cells are able to produce different hormone-producing and neuron-like cells and they may therefore contribute to postnatal pituitary homeostasis. Indeed, the relative abundance of GPS numbers is altered in Cdk4-deficient mice, a model of hypopituitarism induced by the lack of this cyclin-dependent kinase. Thus, GPS cells may display functional relevance in the physiological expansion of the pituitary gland throughout life as well as protection from pituitary disease.

Training-induced structural brain changes have been demonstrated in the healthy adult human brain. However, no study has yet directly related structural brain changes to behavioral changes in the developing brain, addressing the question of whether structural brain differences seen in adults (comparing experts with matched controls) are a product of "nature" (via biological brain predispositions) or "nurture" (via early training). Longterm instrumental music training is an intense, multisensory, and motor experience and offers an ideal opportunity to study structural brain plasticity in the developing brain in correlation with behavioral changes induced by training. Here we demonstrate structural brain changes after only 15 months of musical training in early childhood, which were correlated with improvements in musically relevant motor and auditory skills. These findings shed light on brain plasticity and suggest that structural brain differences in adult experts (whether musicians or experts in other areas) are likely due to training-induced brain plasticity.

Methods: We conducted a population-based case-control study where the cases were children with a first episode of acute CNS inflammatory demyelination in France (1994-2003). Each case was matched on age, sex, and geographic location to up to 12 controls, randomly selected from the general population. Information on vaccinations was confirmed by a copy of the vaccination certificate. The odds ratios (ORs) of CNS inflammatory demyelination associated with HB vaccination were estimated using conditional logistic regression. Results: The rates of HB vaccination in the 3 years before the index date were 24.4% for the 349 cases and 27.3% for their 2,941 matched controls. HB vaccination within this period was not associated with an increase in the rate of CNS inflammatory demyelination (adjusted OR, 0.74; 0.54-1.02), neither > 3 years nor as a function of the number of injections or brand type. When the analysis was restricted to subjects compliant with vaccination, HB vaccine exposure > 3 years before index date was associated with an increased trend (1.50; 0.93-2.43), essentially from the Engerix B vaccine (1.74; 1.03-2.95). The OR was particularly elevated for this brand in patients with confirmed multiple sclerosis (2.77; 1.23-6.24). Conclusions: Hepatitis B vaccination does not generally increase the risk of CNS inflammatory demyelination in childhood. However, the Engerix B vaccine appears to increase this risk, particularly for confirmed multiple sclerosis, in the longer term. Our results require confirmation in future studies.

Screening of a large panel of glioma samples increasing histological grade demonstrated frequencies of CD133(+) cells which correlated with high expression of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 and of membrane type-1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP). Methods: We used qRT-PCR and immunoblotting to examine the molecular interplay between MT1-MMP and COX-2 gene and protein expression in parental, CD133(+), and neurospheres U87 glioma cell cultures. Results: We found that CD133, COX-2 and MT1-MMP expression were enhanced when glioma cells were cultured in neurosphere conditions. A CD133(+)-enriched U87 glioma cell population, isolated from parental U87 cells with magnetic cell sorting technology, also grew as neurospheres and showed enhanced COX-2 expression. MT1-MMP gene silencing antagonized COX-2 expression in neurospheres, while overexpression of recombinant MT1-MMP directly triggered COX-2 expression in U87 cells independent from MT1-MMP's catalytic function. COX-2 induction by MT1-MMP was also validated in wild-type and in NF-kappa B p65(-/-) mutant mouse embryonic fibroblasts, but was abrogated in NF-kappa B1 (p50(-/-)) mutant cells. Conclusion: We provide evidence for enhanced COX-2 expression in CD133(+) glioma cells, and direct cell-based evidence of NF-kappa B-mediated COX-2 regulation by MT1-MMP. The biological significance of such checkpoint control may account for COX-2-dependent mechanisms of inflammatory balance responsible of therapy resistance phenotype of cancer stem cells.

The primary outcome assessed whether this combination would increase the rate of development of new active lesions on cranial MRI scans vs GA alone. Methods: This phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study included patients aged 19 to 55 years who were treated with GA for at least 1 year before randomization and experienced at least one relapse during the previous year. Patients received IV natalizumab 300 mg (n = 55) or placebo (n = 55) once every 4 weeks plus GA 20 mg subcutaneously once daily for <= 20 weeks. Results: The mean rate of development of new active lesions was 0.03 with combination therapy vs 0.11 with GA alone (p = 0.031). Combination therapy resulted in lower mean numbers of new gadolinium-enhancing lesions (0.6 vs 2.3 for GA alone, p = 0.020) and new/newly enlarging T2-hyperintense lesions (0.5 vs 1.3, p = 0.029). The incidence of infection and infusion reactions was similar in both groups; no hypersensitivity reactions were observed. One serious adverse event occurred with combination therapy (elective hip surgery). With the exception of an increase in anti-natalizumab antibodies with combination therapy, laboratory data were consistent with previous clinical studies of natalizumab alone. Conclusion: The combination of natalizumab and glatiramer acetate seemed safe and well tolerated during 6 months of therapy. Neurology (R) 2009; 72: 806-812	[Goodman, A.

Normally present, its persistence is suggestive of neurologic dysfunction and a prognostic marker highly suggestive of an adverse outcome. Working in different fields, with different approaches and largely independently, three leaders of early 20th century neurosciences (Rudolf Magnus, Josef Gerstmann, and Arnold Gesell) elaborated different aspects of this primitive reflex. Magnus provided the first description in an animal model utilizing a meticulously prepared decerebrate cat correctly identifying the reflex's reliance on proprioceptors in the neck and processing in the upper cervical segment. Gerstmann first described its occurrence in the setting of neurologic disease, providing a meticulous written description in an early description of the index case of what would later be eponymously designated Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker syndrome.

J	Hernandez, G; Shizgal, P				Hernandez, Giovanni; Shizgal, Peter			Dynamic changes in dopamine tone during self-stimulation of the ventral tegmental area in rats	BEHAVIOURAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						In-vivo microdialysis; Dopamine; Nucleus accumbens; Self-stimulation; Ventral tegmental area; Continuous reinforcement schedule; Phasic; Tonic	NUCLEUS-ACCUMBENS DOPAMINE; MEDIAL FOREBRAIN-BUNDLE; EXTRACELLULAR DOPAMINE; ELECTRICAL-STIMULATION; INVIVO MICRODIALYSIS; BRAIN-STIMULATION; RELEASE; REWARD; BEHAVIOR; NEUROCHEMISTRY	In a prior study, phasic release of dopamine (DA) in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) was only transiently and rarely detected by means of fast-scan cyclic voltammetry (FCSV) in rats already trained to work for electrical stimulation of the ventral tegmental area (VTA) on a continuous reinforcement schedule. However, in rats receiving rewarding electrical stimulation via lateral hypothalamic (LH) electrodes, elevated DA tone in the NAc terminal field was detected via microdialysis for up to 2 h, even when short (1.5 s) inter-train intervals were employed. To better characterize the similarities and differences between the FSCV and microdialysis measurements, we trained rats to self-administer VTA stimulation under conditions similar to those employed in the initial FSCV Study. The results resemble those obtained by means of microdialysis in rats receiving LH Stimulation but differed from the prior FSCV data. Although the concentration of DA in dialysate obtained from NAc probes did fall after having peaked at the 30 min mark, this decline set in much later than in the FSCV studies, and elevated DA tone could still be detected after 110 min of self-stimulation. The stimulation-induced peak in DA tone could be restored by a 30 min rest period, a manipulation that was ineffective previously in restoring the FSCV measure of phasic release. These findings are discussed in terms of the differential sensitivity of the FSCV and microdialysis methods to phasic and tonic signaling by DA neurons and to different transitions between their activity states.

Motor sequence learning in primate: Role of the D2 receptor in movement chunking during consolidation	BEHAVIOURAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Motor learning; Movement; Dopamine; D2 receptor; Raclopride; Sumanirole	NIGROSTRIATAL DOPAMINE SYSTEM; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; BASAL GANGLIA; SENSORIMOTOR ADAPTATION; SQUIRREL-MONKEYS; STRIATAL NEURONS; PLASTICITY; ERROR; REPRESENTATIONS; SCHIZOPHRENIA	Motor learning disturbances have been shown in diseases involving dopamine insufficiency such as Parkinson's disease and schizophrenic patients under antipsychotic drug treatment. In non-human primates, motor learning deficits have also been observed following systemic administration of raclopride, a selective D2-receptor antagonist. These deficits were characterized by persistent fluctuations of performance from trial to trial, and were described as difficulties in consolidating movements following a learning period. Moreover, it has been suggested that these raclopride-induced fluctuations can result from impediments in grouping separate movements into one fluent sequence. In the present Study, we explore the hypothesis that such fluctuations during movement consolidation can be prevented through the use of sumanirole - a highly selective D2 agonist - if administered before raclopride. Two monkeys were trained to execute a well known sequence of movements, which was later recalled under three pharmacological conditions: (1) no drug, (2) raclopride, and (3) sumanirole + raclopride. The same three pharmacological conditions were repeated with the two monkeys, trained this time to learn new sequences of movements. Results show that raclopride has no deleterious effect on the well known sequence, nor the sumanirole + raclopride co-administration. However, results on the new sequence to be learned revealed continuous fluctuations of performances in the raclopride condition, but not in the sumanirole + raclopride condition. These fluctuations occurred concurrently with a difficulty in merging separate movement components, known as a "chunking deficit". D2 receptors seem therefore to be involved in the consolidation of new motor skills, and this might involve the chunking of separate movements into integrated motor sequences. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Although the neurologic dysfunction and brain damage resulting from the biochemical consequences of TD is well characterized, the mechanism(s) that lead to the selective histological lesions characteristic of this disorder remain a mystery. Over the course of many years, various structural and functional changes have been identified that could lead to cell death in this disorder. However, despite a concerted effort to explain the consequences of TD in terms of these changes, our understanding of the pathophysiology of this disorder remains unclear. This review will focus on three of these processes, i.e. oxidative stress, glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity and inflammation and their role in selective vulnerability in TD. Since TD inhibits oxidative metabolism, a feature of many neurodegenerative disease states, it represents a model system with which to explore pathological mechanisms inherent in such maladies, with the potential to yield new insights into their possible treatment and prevention.

Measuring Demyelination and Remyelination in Acute Multiple Sclerosis Lesion Voxels	ARCHIVES OF NEUROLOGY			English	Article							QUANTITATIVE MAGNETIZATION-TRANSFER; WHITE-MATTER; CLINICAL-APPLICATIONS; INVERSION-RECOVERY; TRANSFER RATIO; MRI; BRAIN; RELAXATION; TISSUES; APPEARANCE	Objective: To validate the use of the magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) as a practical imaging marker of demyelination and remyelination in acute multiple sclerosis lesions. Design: Case study. Setting: University hospital multiple sclerosis clinic. Patients: Six patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis and acute gadolinium-enhancing lesions were studied serially using a quantitative magnetization transfer examination. Main Outcome Measures: Changes in the water content and macromolecular content, a marker of myelin content that, unlike MTR, is not affected by changes in water content (edema) associated with acute inflammation, and changes in MTR of lesions. Results: Both the macromolecular content and MTR were lower than normal in acute lesions and recovered over several months. The decrease in macromolecular content relative to contralateral normal-appearing white matter was greater than the decrease in MTR (0.46 vs 0.75 at the time of gadolinium enhancement), likely because edema in the acute lesion increased the T1 relaxation time of water and attenuated the decrease in MTR. Nevertheless, there was still a strong correlation between changes in the relative MTR and macromolecular content (R(2) = 0.70; P < .001). Conclusion: Our data support the use of MTR as a practical marker of demyelination and remyelination, even in acute lesions where decreases in MTR are attenuated because of the effects of edema.

Self-activation of Caspase-6 in vitro and in vivo: Caspase-6 activation does not induce cell death in HEK293T cells	BIOCHIMICA ET BIOPHYSICA ACTA-MOLECULAR CELL RESEARCH			English	Article						Caspase-6; Caspase self-activation; Effector caspase; HEK293T; Caspase activation; Caspase activity; Alzheimer disease	INDUCED PROXIMITY MODEL; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; GRANULOVACUOLAR DEGENERATION; INDUCED APOPTOSIS; HUMAN NEURONS; GRANZYME-B; PROTEASES; CASCADE; PROTEIN; OVEREXPRESSION	Caspase-6 (Casp6) is a short pro-domain caspase that is activated early in Alzheimer disease, yet, little is known on the mechanism of activation of this caspase. In this study, critical proteolytic processing events required for Casp6 activation in vitro and in vivo were evaluated by site directed mutagenesis of the D23 prodomain, and D179 and D193 linker processing sites. We found that (1) Casp6 was self-processed and activated in vitro and in vivo, (2) uncleavable Casp6 possessed low activity in vitro but not in vivo, (3) the prodomain of Casp6 entirely prevented self-processing and activation in vivo but not in vitro, (4) removal of the pro-domain promoted Casp6 activation, (5) cleavage at either D179 or D193 was sufficient to generate activity in vitro and in vivo, and (6) Casp6 activity did not induce cell death in HEK293T cells. We conclude that the Casp6 is activated through proteolytic cleavage, as are the effector Caspase-3 and -7. However, unlike other effector caspases, Casp6 can be entirely self-activated and its activation does not necessarily induce cell death. Crown Copyright (c) 2008 Published by Elsevier B.V.

The Oxidative Stress Response Is Region Specific in Organogenesis Stage Mouse Embryos Exposed to 5-Bromo-2 '-deoxyuridine	BIRTH DEFECTS RESEARCH PART A-CLINICAL AND MOLECULAR TERATOLOGY			English	Article						BrdU; teratogen; c-Fos; 8-oxoguanine	DNA-BINDING ACTIVITY; CURLY-TAIL; CELL-DEATH; 5-BROMODEOXYURIDINE; MICE; AP-1; BROMODEOXYURIDINE; DIFFERENTIATION; TERATOGENICITY; HYDROXYUREA	BACKGROUND: The exposure of mouse embryos to 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU), a model teratogen, generates oxidative stress, induces c-Fos dependent activator protein-1 (AP-1) DNA binding activity, and causes skeletal malformations (Sahambi and Hales, 2006). The goal of this study was to test the hypothesis that the ability of BrdU to induce oxidative stress, rather than its incorporation into DNA per se, is responsible for triggering the ensuing malformations. To test this hypothesis, we examined the regional localization of BrdU incorporation, 8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG), a marker of oxidative stress, and c-Fos immunoreactivity in organogenesis stage mouse embryos exposed to a teratogenic dose of BrdU. METHODS: Timed pregnant CD1 mice received vehicle (saline) or BrdU (600 or 1000 mg/kg body weight) on gestation day 9. N-acetyl-L-cysteine, a glutathione precursor, was administered to GD 9 mice 2 hours before treatment with vehicle or BrdU to determine the impact of inhibiting the oxidative stress response. Embryos were excised 3 hours after BrdU treatment and processed for staining for BrdU incorporated into DNA, 8-oxoG, and c-Fos. RESULTS: BrdU incorporation, 8-oxoG adduct formation and c-Fos immunoreactivity were highest in the rostral and caudal developing tissues of BrdU-exposed embryos. Although preadministration of N-acetyl-L-cysteine at a dose that decreased BrdU teratogenicity dampened the oxidative stress response, it did not affect the incorporation of BrdU into DNA. CONCLUSIONS: These data show that rostral and caudal neuroepithelial cells are particularly susceptible to oxidative stress in the organogenesis-stage embryo.

The present study sought to investigate the effects of having sustained a sports concussion more than 30 years prior to testing on cognitive and motor functions. Nineteen healthy former athletes, in late adulthood (mean age 60.79; SD 5.16), who sustained their last sport-related concussion in early adulthood (mean age 26.05; SD 9.21) were compared with 21 healthy former athletes with no history of concussion (mean age 58.89; SD 9.07). Neuropsychological tests sensitive to age-related changes in cognition were administered. An auditory oddball paradigm was used to evoke P3a and P3b brain responses. Four TMS paradigms were employed to assess motor cortex excitability: (i) resting motor threshold; (ii) paired-pulse intracortical inhibition and intracortical facilitation; (iii) input/output curve and (iv) cortical silent period (CSP). A rapid alternating movement task was also used to characterize motor system dysfunctions. Relative to controls, former athletes with a history of concussion had: (i) lower performance on neuropsychological tests of episodic memory and response inhibition; (ii) significantly delayed and attenuated P3a/P3b components; (iii) significantly prolonged CSP and (iv) significantly reduced movement velocity (bradykinesia). The finding that the P3, the CSP as well as neuropsychological and motor indices were altered more than three decades post-concussion provides evidence for the chronicity of cognitive and motor system changes consecutive to sports concussion.

Using an explicitly learned pointing task paradigm, thirty participants were assigned to one of three groups that differed in the training method (PP. MI, and control groups). The physical performance was measured before training (pre-test), as well as before (post-test 1) and after a night of sleep (post-test 2). The time taken to complete the pointing tasks, the number of errors and the kinematic trajectories were the dependent variables. As expected, both the PP and the MI groups improved their performance during the post-test 1. The MI group was further found to enhance motor performance after sleep, hence suggesting that sleep-related effects are effective following mental practice. Such findings highlight the reliability of MI in learning process, which is thought consolidated when associated with sleep. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The results of a literature review suggest that delusional and hallucinatory experiences are more common in the general population than we may think, and that there could well be a symptomatic continuum between people who have and people who have not been diagnosed with indisputable psychotic disorders. In the nonclinical population, voices are mainly positive and nonthreatening. Conversely, in the psychiatric population, they tend to be frequent, intrusive, and distressing. We address the question of voices considered as various human experiences and describe the emergence of the nonclinical group of people who hear voices. We also review the pathophysiology of auditory hallucinations as an illustration of a neurophysiological anomaly, which is useful to understand psychosis or schizophrenia. The main obstacle in the category-specific thought is that it remains impossible to unmistakably demarcate the border around schizophrenia. It is evident that the creation of a boundary is always possible by using arbitrary criteria that improve interrater reliability but exclude a considerable number of people who share multiple common features with diagnosed people.

Here, we utilized diffusion tensor imaging deterministic tractography to construct a macroscale anatomical network capturing the underlying common connectivity pattern of human cerebral cortex in a large sample of subjects (80 young adults) and further quantitatively analyzed its topological properties with graph theoretical approaches. The cerebral cortex was divided into 78 cortical regions, each representing a network node, and 2 cortical regions were considered connected if the probability of fiber connections exceeded a statistical criterion. The topological parameters of the established cortical network (binarized) resemble that of a "small-world" architecture characterized by an exponentially truncated power-law distribution. These characteristics imply high resilience to localized damage. Furthermore, this cortical network was characterized by major hub regions in association cortices that were connected by bridge connections following long-range white matter pathways. Our results are compatible with previous structural and functional brain networks studies and provide insight into the organizational principles of human brain anatomical networks that underlie functional states.

Using a combination of confocal microscopy and the fluorescence loss in photobleaching technique in living hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons expressing membrane-linked GFP, we observed a clear correlation between spine shape parameters and the diffusion and compartmentalization of membrane-associated proteins. The kinetics of membrane-linked GFP exchange between the dendritic shaft and the spine head compartment were slower in dendritic spines with long necks and/or large heads than in those with short necks and/or small heads. Furthermore, when the spine area was reduced by eliciting epileptiform activity, the kinetics of protein exchange between the spine compartments exhibited a concomitant decrease. As synaptic plasticity is considered to involve the dynamic flux by lateral diffusion of membrane-bound proteins into and out of the synapse, our data suggest that spine shape represents an important parameter in the susceptibility of synapses to undergo plastic change.

As part of a longitudinal study of brain maturation and cognitive development during adolescence, we employed dense-array EEG and spatiotemporal source analysis to characterize maturational changes in the timing of brain responses to temporal variations in sound. We found significant changes in the brain responses compared longitudinally at two time points in early adolescence, namely 10 years (65 subjects) and 11.5 years (60 of the 65 subjects), as well as large differences between adults, studied with the same protocol (Poulsen, Picton & Paus, 2007), and the children at 10 and 11.5 years of age. The transient auditory evoked potential to tone onset showed decreases in the latency of vertex and T-complex components, and a highly significant increase in the amplitude of the N1 wave with increasing age. The auditory steady state response to a 40-Hz frequency-modulated tone increased in amplitude with increasing age. The peak frequency of the envelope-following response to sweeps of amplitude-modulated white noise also increased significantly with increasing age. These results indicate persistent maturation of the cortical mechanisms for auditory processing from childhood into middle adulthood.

Investing in early human development: Timing and economic efficiency	ECONOMICS & HUMAN BIOLOGY			English	Article						Early childhood intervention; SES inequalities; Brain development	LOW-BIRTH-WEIGHT; ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES; MATERNAL LIFE-COURSE; COGNITIVE-DEVELOPMENT; SOCIOECONOMIC-STATUS; RANDOMIZED-TRIAL; SCHOOL-AGE; FOLLOW-UP; CHILDREN; HEALTH	Policy discussions to ameliorate socioeconomic (SES) inequalities are increasingly focused on investments in early childhood. Yet such interventions are costly to implement, and clear evidence on the optimal time to intervene to yield a high economic and social return in the future is meagre. The majority of successful early childhood interventions start in the preschool years. However socioeconomic gradients in cognitive skills, socio-emotional functioning and health can be observed by age three, suggesting that preventative programmes starting earlier in childhood may be even more effective. We discuss the optimal timing of early childhood intervention with reference to recent research in developmental neuroscience. We motivate the need for early intervention by providing an overview of the impact of adverse risk factors during the antenatal and early childhood periods on outcomes later in life. We provide a brief review of the economic rationale for investing early in life and propose the "antenatal investment hypothesis". We conclude by discussing a suite of new European interventions that will inform this optimal timing debate. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

POLYCHLORINATED-BIPHENYLS PCBS; BLOOD PARTITION-COEFFICIENTS; DIOXIN-LIKE COMPOUNDS; BREAST-MILK; DEVELOPING BRAIN; RISK; CHEMICALS; CHILDREN; TISSUE; SERUM	BACKGROUND: It has been suggested that pre- and postnatal exposure to persistent organic pollutants (POPs) can promote several adverse effects in children, such as altered neurodevelopment. Epidemiologic studies to date have relied on the analysis of biological samples drawn pre- or postnatally for exposure assessment, an approach that might not capture some key events in the toxico-kinetics of POPs. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to build a generic physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling framework for neutral POPs to assess infant toxicokinetic profiles and to validate the model using data on POP levels measured in mothers and infants from a Northern Quebec Inuit population. METHODS: The PBPK model developed herein was based upon a previously published model to which an infant submodel was added. Using the model and maternal blood levels at the time of delivery, exposure to 1, 1-dichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethylene (p,p'-DDE), 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethane (pp'-DDT), hexachlorobenzene (HCB), beta-hexachlorocyclohexane (beta-HCH), 2,2',3,4,4',5'-hexachlorobiphenyl (PCB-138), 2,2',4,4',5,5'-hexachlorobiphenyl (PCB-153), and 2,2',3,4,4',5,5'-heptachlorobiphenyl (PCB-180) in mothers was estimated to subsequently simulate infant blood, breast milk, and cord blood POP concentration. Simulations were then compared with corresponding measured levels through Spearman correlation analyses. RESULTS: Predictions were highly correlated with measured concentrations for PCB-153, PCB-180, PCB-138, HCB, and p,p'-DDE (r = 0.83-0.96). Weaker correlations were observed for p,p'-DDT and beta-HCH for which levels were near the limits of detection. CONCLUSION: This is the first study to validate a PBPK model of POPs in infants on an individual basis. This approach will reduce sampling efforts and enable the use of individualized POP toxicokinetic profiles in the epidemiologic studies of POP adverse effects on child development.

To date, little is known on the neuronal mechanisms leading to epileptiform synchronization in this structure. Therefore, we investigated the role of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission in epileptiform activity in this cortical area. In addition, since the ACC presents with a high density of opioid receptors, we studied the effect of opioid agonism on epileptiform synchronization in this brain region. Methods: We used field and intracellular recordings in conjunction with pharmacological manipulations to characterize the epileptiform activity generated by the rat ACC in a brain slice preparation. Results: Bath-application of the convulsant 4-aminopyridine (4AP, 50 mu M) induced both brief and prolonged periods of epileptiform synchronization resembling interictal- and ictal-like discharges, respectively. Interictal events could occur more frequently before the onset of ictal activity that was contributed by N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. Mu-opioid receptor activation abolished 4AP-induced ictal events and markedly reduced the occurrence of the pharmacologically isolated GABAergic synchronous potentials. Ictal discharges were replaced by interictal events during GABAergic antagonism; this GABA-independent activity was influenced by subsequent mu-opioid agonist application. Conclusions: Our results indicate that both glutamatergic and GABAergic signaling contribute to epileptiform synchronization leading to the generation of electrographic ictal events in the ACC. In addition, mu-opioid receptors appear to modulate both excitatory and inhibitory mechanisms, thus influencing epileptiform synchronization in the ACC.

It is important to develop non-invasive tools to determine markers of brain function that could have predictive value for the outcome of FSs infants. Pattern visual evoked potentials (pVEPs) were recorded in 18 FS infants (mean age of seizure 15.97 months). Spectral density and coherence analyses were performed in infants evaluated at 1.1 month (n = 4), 5.75 months (n = 4) or 30.33 months (n = 6) following a prolonged FS and compared to age-matched healthy controls. The impact of severity of seizures was assessed by comparing the children who had prolonged FSs to 4 infants that had experienced a simple FS. Cognitive tests (Bayley, Stanford-Binet) were administered at the time of testing in FS and control children. Behavioural measures (Achenbach Child Behavior Check List) were administered two years after the FS. pVEP responses and coherence measures failed to yield significant differences between the FS groups and healthy controls. However, spectral density measures showed a significant increase in delta band activity in both FS groups and a reduced high frequency density only in the prolonged FS groups that was seen up to 39 months post-seizure. Behavioural and cognitive measures revealed cognitive development within average, but lower attentional capacities in the FS infants. The persistent changes in spectral density patterns seen in children with prolonged FS may reflect seizure induced alterations in the developing brain or a result of a complex mode of inheritance. Further studies are needed to determine whether these observations can be used as a marker to predict the vulnerability of the child in developing behavioral deficits or epilepsy.

However, experimental evidence has revealed that epileptiform synchronization is also contributed to by population events mediated by GABA(A) receptors. Here, we analysed the spatial distribution of GABA(A)-receptor-dependent interictal events in the hippocampal/parahippocampal region of the adult guinea pig brain isolated in vitro. We found that arterial perfusion of this preparation with 4-aminopyridine caused the appearance of glutamatergic-independent interictal potentials that were reversibly abolished by GABA(A) receptor antagonism. Laminar profiles and current source density analysis performed in different limbic areas demonstrated that these GABA(A)-receptor-mediated events were independently generated in different areas of the hippocampal/parahippocampal formation (most often in the medial entorhinal cortex) and propagated between interconnected limbic structures of both hemispheres. Finally, intracellular recordings from principal neurons of the medial entorhinal cortex demonstrated that the GABAergic field potential correlated to inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (membrane potential reversal, -68.12 +/- 8.01 mV, n = 5) that were interrupted by ectopic spiking. Our findings demonstrate that, in an acute seizure model developed in the adult guinea pig brain, hypersynchronous GABA(A)-receptor-mediated interictal events are generated from independent sources and propagate within limbic cortices in the absence of excitatory synaptic transmission. As spared or enhanced inhibition was reported in models of epilepsy, our data may support a role of GABA-mediated signaling in ictogenesis and epileptogenesis.

The goal of this study was to further understand the role of the basal ganglia and prefrontal cortex in the realm of self-initiated and externally-triggered right and left hand movements. Young healthy right-handed adults performed random, follow and repeat conditions of a finger moving task with their right and left hands, while being scanned with functional magnetic resonance imaging. Significant activation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex was observed when comparing the self-initiated movements with the repeated control and externally-triggered movements when using either hand in agreement with its role in monitoring. The caudate nucleus activation was found during self-initiated conditions compared with the control condition when either hand was used, showing that it is particularly involved when a new movement needs to be planned. Significant putamen activation was observed in all within-hand contrasts except for the externally-triggered vs. control condition when using the left hand. Furthermore, greater putaminal activation was found for the left vs. the right hand during the control condition, but for the right vs. the left hand subtraction for the self-initiated condition. Our results show that the putamen is particularly involved in the execution of non-routine movements, especially if those are self-initiated. Furthermore, we propose that, for right-handed people performing fine movements, as far as putamen involvement is concerned, the lack of proficiency of the non-dominant hand may prevail over other task demands.

Indeed, in rodents, exposure to chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) produces depressive-like behaviours such as behavioural despair and anhedonia. To date, there have not been many studies that especially explore in vivo changes in 5-HT neurotransmission associated with CUS in the rat. Therefore, using in vivo etectrophysiology, we evaluated whether CUS that induces anhedonia-like behaviours concurrently impairs midbrain raphe 5-HT neuronal activity. Unlike unstressed and acutely stressed rats, CUS produced progressive reductions in sucrose intake and preference (anhedonia-like). These were associated with a decrease in the spontaneous firing activity (35.4%) as welt as in the number of spontaneously active 5-HT neurons, and a desensitization of somatodendritic 5-HT1A autoreceptors in the dorsal raphe. These results suggest that CUS dramatically decreases 5-HT neural activity and 5-HT1A autoreceptor sensitivity, and may represent endophenotypic features of depressive-like states.

New insights into action-perception coupling	EXPERIMENTAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article							EQUILIBRIUM-POINT CONTROL; SINGLE-JOINT MOVEMENT; STRETCH REFLEX; MOTOR CONTROL; PROPRIOCEPTIVE FEEDBACK; REFERENT CONFIGURATION; SACCADIC SUPPRESSION; THRESHOLD CONTROL; DECEREBRATE CAT; PHANTOM LIMBS	According to a view that has dominated the field for over a century, the brain programs muscle commands and uses a copy of these commands [efference copy (EC)] to adjust not only resulting motor action but also ongoing perception. This view was helpful in formulating several classical problems of action and perception: (1) the posture-movement problem of how movements away from a stable posture can be made without evoking resistance of posture-stabilizing mechanisms resulting from intrinsic muscle and reflex properties; (2) the problem of kinesthesia or why our sense of limb position is good despite ambiguous positional information delivered by proprioceptive and cutaneous signals; (3) the problem of visual space constancy or why the world is perceived as stable while its retinal image shifts following changes in gaze. On closer inspection, the EC theory actually does not solve these problems in a physiologically feasible way. Here solutions to these problems are proposed based on the advanced formulation of the equilibrium-point hypothesis that suggests that action and perception are accomplished in a common spatial frame of reference selected by the brain from a set of available frames. Experimental data suggest that the brain is also able to translate or/and rotate the selected frame of reference by modifying its major attributes-the origin, metrics and orientation-and thus substantially influence action and perception. Because of this ability, such frames are called physical to distinguish them from symbolic or mathematical frames that are used to describe system behavior without influencing this behavior. Experimental data also imply that once a frame of reference is chosen, its attributes are modified in a feedforward way, thus enabling the brain to act in an anticipatory and predictive manner. This approach is extended to sense of effort, kinesthetic illusions, phantom limb and phantom body phenomena. It also addresses the question of why retinal images of objects are sensed as objects located in the external, physical world, rather than in internal representations of the brain.

We identified 22R-hydroxycholesterol to be present in much lower levels in the hippocampus and frontal cortex of Alzheimer's disease than in tissue from age-matched controls. 22R-hydroxycholesterol was shown to protect against beta-amyloid (A beta(42))-induced neurotoxicity and block the formation of A beta oligomers. In search of a 22R-hydroxycholesterol stable analog, we identified the naturally occurring heterospirostenol, (22R,25R)-20 alpha-spirost-5-en-3 beta-yl hexanoate (caprospinol). The mechanism of action underlying the neuroprotective properties of caprospinol involves, first, the ability of the compound to bind A beta(42) and, second, its interaction with components of the mitochondria respiratory chain. Samaritan Pharmaceuticals is developing caprospinol as a disease-modifying drug for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Samaritan Pharmaceuticals filed for an Investigational New Drug application with the FDA in 2006. The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parts of the application were found satisfactory, and the FDA has requested that additional information is submitted in support of caprospinol's safety prior to initiating the Phase I clinical study.

In the present study, APPswe/PS1 bigenic mice had higher levels of irritability than non-transgenic controls as measured in the touch escape test. Moreover, APPswe/PS1 mice showed poorer nest building than controls and a higher duration of immobility in the forced swimming assay. These results are concordant with the hypothesis of increased apathy and depression-like behavior in an Alzheimer's disease model. In addition, APPswe/PS1 bigenic mice were deficient in retention of passive avoidance learning and left-right discrimination learning, concordant with previous findings in other Alzheimer-like models.

It is believed that cyclic AMP-response element-binding (CREB) plays an important role in orchestrating the molecular events that guide neuroplastic change, although the details of its genomic targets during normal postnatal development or in response to sensory deprivation remain unknown. Here, we performed CREB chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) from monkey area V1 tissue and hybridized enriched DNA fragments to promoter microarrays (ChIP chip analysis). Our goal was to determine and categorize the CREB regulon in monkey area V1 at two distinct developmental stages (peak of critical period vs. adulthood) and after 5 days of monocular enucleation (ME) at both ages. Classification of enriched candidates showed that the majority of isolated promoter loci (n = 795) were common to all four conditions. A particularly interesting group of candidates (n = 192) was specific to samples derived from enucleated infant area V1. Gene ontology analysis of CREB targets during early postnatal development showed a subgroup of genes implicated in cytoskeleton-based structural modification. Analysis of messenger RNA expression (quantitative real-time-polymerase chain reaction) of candidate genes showed striking differences in expression profiles between infant and adult area V1 after ME. Our study represents the first extensive genomic analysis of CREB DNA occupancy in monkey neocortex and provides new insight into the multifaceted transcriptional role of CREB in guiding neuroplastic change.

Large-Scale Neural Model Validation of Partial Correlation Analysis for Effective Connectivity Investigation in Functional MRI	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING			English	Article						functional MRI; brain functional interactions; effective connectivity; structural equation modeling; partial correlation; large-scale neural model	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; NETWORK ANALYSIS; VISUAL PATHWAYS; BRAIN NETWORKS; TIME-SERIES; FMRI; INTERACTIVITY; SIGNALS; CORTEX; TASK	Recent Studies of functional connectivity based upon blood oxygen level dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging have shown that this technique allows one to investigate large-scale functional brain networks. In a previous study, we advocated that data-driven measures of effective connectivity should be developed to bridge the gap between functional and effective connectivity. To attain this goal, we proposed a novel approach based on the partial correlation matrix. In this study, we further validate the use of partial correlation analysis by employing a large-scale, neurobiologically realistic neural network model to generate simulated data that we analyze with both structural equation modeling (SEM) and the partial correlation approach. Unlike real experimental data, where the interregional anatomical links are not necessarily known, the links between the nodes of the network model are fully specified, and thus provide a standard against which to judge the results of SEM and partial correlation analyses. Our results show that partial correlation analysis from the data alone exhibits patterns of effective connectivity that are similar to those found using SEM, and both are in agreement with respect to the underlying neuroarchitecture. Our findings thus provide a strong validation for the partial correlation method. Hunt Brain Mapp 30:941-950, 2009. (c) 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

The Proportion of Mutations Predicted To Have a Deleterious Effect Differs Between Gain and Loss of Function Genes in Neurodegenerative Disease	HUMAN MUTATION			English	Article						Bioinformatics; missense mutation prediction programs; gain of function genes; SOD1	AMYOTROPHIC-LATERAL-SCLEROSIS; ZINC SUPEROXIDE-DISMUTASE; AFFECT PROTEIN FUNCTION; NUCLEOTIDE POLYMORPHISMS; SNPS	As more studies are turning to bioinformatic prediction programs to assess the potential impact of amino acid substitutions, it is relevant to evaluate the prediction results these programs give in genes that have been well-characterized for Mendelian diseases. Eight genes responsible for neurodegenerative disease with many identified mutations were sub-grouped into those that either have a gain or loss of function disease mechanism. Three prediction programs, PolyPhen, Panther and SIFT, were queried for the reported missense mutations. The mean percent of benign mutations was significantly higher in gain of function genes using the PolyPhen program (38% versus 21%, p=0.007). The probability that a gain of function mutation was predicted to have a damaging role was also significantly less using the Panther program (p=4.86 x 10(-12)). In contrast, there was no difference between gain and loss of function gene when the SIFT program was used. However, the most accurate distinction between gain and loss of function genes could be obtained when considering the mutations for which all three programs predicted the same result. Further, stratification of SOD1 mutations indicated that only the PolyPhen program could distinguish mutations that impaired enzymatic activity of SOD1 from those with near wildtype activity. The profile of benign and damaging changes from these genes will aid in the interpretation of bioinformatic prediction program results from missense mutations identified in novel genes.

In this work we extend a previously proposed method for fMRI to estimate the parameters of a linear model of DOI time series. The regression is performed in the wavelet domain to infer drift coefficients at different scales and to estimate the strength of the hemodynamic response function (HRF). This multiresolution approach benefits from the whitening property of the discrete wavelet transform (DWT), which approximately decorrelates long-memory, noise processes. We also show that a more accurate estimation is obtained by removing some regressors correlating with the protocol. Moreover, we observe that this improvement is related to a quantitative measure of 1/f noise. The performances of the method are first evaluated against a standard spline-cosine drift approach with simulated HRF and real background physiology. Lastly, the technique is applied to experimental event-related data acquired by near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS).

While in the last few years, developments in computational neuroanatomy have made possible the in vivo quantification of cortical thickness, the relationship between cortical thickness and psychometric intelligence has been little studied. Recently, cortical thickness estimations have been improved by the use of an iterative hemisphere-specific template registration algorithm which provides a better between-subject alignment of brain surfaces. Using this improvement, we aimed to further characterize brain regions where cortical thickness was associated with cognitive ability differences and to test the hypothesis that these regions are mostly located in multimodal association areas. We report associations between a general cognitive ability factor (as an estimate of g) derived from the four subtests of the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence and cortical thickness adjusted for age, gender, and scanner in a large sample of healthy children and adolescents (ages 6-18, n=216) representative of the US population. Significant positive associations were evidenced between the cognitive ability factor and cortical thickness in most multimodal association areas.

Obesity and weight gain in relation to depression: findings from the Stirling County Study	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF OBESITY			English	Article						major depression; overeating; gaining weight; atypical depression	NATIONAL COMORBIDITY SURVEY; ATYPICAL DEPRESSION; GENERAL-POPULATION; MAJOR DEPRESSION; NEUROVEGETATIVE SYMPTOMS; PSYCHIATRIC-EPIDEMIOLOGY; AFFECTIVE-DISORDERS; MENTAL-HEALTH; UNITED-STATES; COMMUNITY	Objective: This study concerns the question of whether obese subjects in a community sample experience depression in a different way from the nonobese, especially whether they overeat to the point of gaining weight during periods of depression. Design: A representative sample of adults was interviewed regarding depression and obesity. Subjects: The sample consisted of 1396 subjects whose interviews were studied regarding relationships between obesity and depression and among whom 114 had experienced a major depressive episode at some point in their lives and provided information about the symptoms experienced during the worst or only episode of major depression. Measurements: The Diagnostic Interview Schedule (DIS) was used to identify major depressive episodes. Information was also derived from the section on Depression and Anxiety (DPAX) of the Stirling Study Schedule. Obesity was calculated as a body mass index 430. Logistic regressions were employed to assess relationships, controlling for age and gender, by means of odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals. Results: In the sample as a whole, obesity was not related to depression although it was associated with the symptom of hopelessness. Among those who had ever experienced a major depressive episode, obese persons were 5 times more likely than the nonobese to overeat leading to weight gain during a period of depression (P<0.002). These obese subjects, compared to the nonobese, also experienced longer episodes of depression, a larger number of episodes, and were more preoccupied with death during such episodes. Conclusions: Depression among obese subjects in a community sample tends to be more severe than among the nonobese. Gaining weight while depressed is an important marker of that severity. Further research is needed to understand and possibly prevent the associations, sequences and outcomes among depression, obesity, weight gain and other adversities.	[Murphy, J. M.; Sobol, A.

Clinical utility has yet to be determined for breast cancer, where an emerging group at high risk of brain metastasis has fuelled consideration of PCI. Methods and Materials: In reviewing our experience with PCI as part of a complex protocol for advanced breast cancer, we present descriptive data on late central nervous system outcomes in those receiving PCI. After high-dose anthracycline-based induction chemotherapy, Stage IIIB/IV breast cancer responders underwent tandem autologous marrow transplantation. Those in continued remission were referred for PCI. Whole-brain radiotherapy was delivered by usual means, at 36 Gy in 20 fractions. Results: Twenty-four women, with median age 45 (28-61), were enrolled between 1995 and 1998. Disease was largely metastatic (79%), and 75% were previously exposed to chemotherapy or hormonotherapy. Ten patients received PCI, at a median of 13.4 (11.8-16.5) months from study entry. Six patients developed brain metastases, 2 despite PCI. Striking functional decline was documented in 3 patients (at 9 months, 4 years, and 5 years post-PCI), including one previously high-functioning woman requiring full care for posttreatment dementia. Conclusions: We present a series of advanced breast cancer patients treated prophylactically with whole-brain radiotherapy following an aggressive chemotherapy regimen. Although the therapeutic benefit of PCI is not ascertainable here, we describe brain metastases occurring despite PCI and serious long-term neurobehavioral sequelae in PCI-treated patients. Any further investigation of PCI in high-risk breast cancer will need to be approached with caution. (c) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Although previous studies have demonstrated that hypoxia induces retinal ganglion cell (RGC) apoptosis and that transient retinal ischemia upregulates the expression of lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) receptors, it remains to be determined whether LPA(1) receptor mediates RGC degeneration during retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). By using an immortalized RGC line (RGC-5), primary neonatal RGC cultures, and oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) to model ROP, the authors explored whether LPA(1) receptor induces RGC degeneration and the potential mechanisms thereof. METHODS. OIR was induced by exposing rat pups to alternating cycles of hyperoxia/hypoxia from postnatal day (P) 0 to P14. RGC viability was evaluated by Fluorogold labeling. Effects of hyperoxia or hypoxia on LPA(1) expression were determined in the RGC-5 line by Western blot. Roles of hypoxia, LPA(1) receptor (with agonist, stearoyl-LPA;antagonist, THG1603; LPA(1) knock-down, shRNA-LPA(1)), and Rho kinase (with inhibitor Y-27632) in mediating RGC survival and neurite outgrowth were assessed by MTT assay and phase-contrast microscopy, respectively. Expression of GFP-LPA(1) in RGC-5 under hypoxia was examined by confocal microscopy. RESULTS. OIR caused pronounced RGC loss in the retina. LPA(1) receptor was expressed by RGCs in retinal tissue, whereas oxygen stress induced its expression in RGC-5. Exposure to stearoyl-LPA or hypoxia substantially reduced the viability of RGCs; this was abrogated by THG1603 and shRNA-LPA(1). THG1603 and Y-27632 treatment also attenuated the adverse effects of hypoxia on RGC-5 neurite outgrowth, and their intravitreal administration prevented OIR-induced RGC loss. Interestingly, overexpression of LPA(1) increased RGC-5 susceptibility to hypoxia-induced cell loss. CONCLUSIONS. Current data strongly support a critical role for LPA(1) receptor in mediating RGC degeneration during OIR.

In adult MDD, abnormalities of fronto-striatal and fronto-cingulate circuitries mediating cognitive control functions have been implicated in the pathogenesis and been related to problems with controlling negative thoughts. No neuroimaging studies of cognitive control functions, however, exist in paediatric depression. This study investigated whether medication-naive adolescents with MDD show abnormal brain activation of fronto-striatal and fronto-cingulate networks when performing tasks of attentional and cognitive control. Event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to compare brain activation between 21 medication-naive adolescents with a first-episode of MDD aged 14-17 years and 21 healthy adolescents, matched for handedness, age, sex, demographics and IQ. Activation paradigms were tasks of selective attention (Simon task), attentional switching (Switch task), and motor response inhibition and error detection (Stop task). In all three tasks, adolescents with depression compared to healthy controls demonstrated reduced activation in task-relevant right dorsolateral (DLPFC), inferior prefrontal cortex (IFC) and anterior cingulate gyrus (ACG). Additional areas of relatively reduced activation were in the parietal lobes during the Stop and Switch tasks, putamen, insula and temporal lobes during the Switch task and precuneus during the Simon task. This study shows first evidence that medication-naive adolescents with MDD are characterised by abnormal function in ACG and right lateral prefrontal cortex during tasks of attention and performance monitoring, suggesting an early pathogenesis of these functional abnormalities attributed to MDD.

The hunter killed the deer), and verbs whose argument realization deviates from canonical hierarchy, such as psych verbs (e.g.,fear, frighten). Subject-Experiencer verbs (e.g., fear) do not assign an Agent role to the subject position of the sentence, but instead assign the role of Experiencer to that position. Object-Experiencer verbs (e.g., frighten) deviate from canonical thematic hierarchy in two ways. Like fear verbs, the frighten verbs do not assign the role of Agent. Moreover, they assign the role of Theme to the subject position and the role of Experiencer to the object position, thus resulting in the non-canonical Theme < Experiencer argument realization. Ten AD patients, I I matched elderly controls, and 49 young controls performed a sentence completion task in which they had to choose a verb that would render the sentence grammatical and meaningful. AD patients showed no problems with canonical structures, but performed worse than controls in psych verb sentences, demonstrating greater difficulty with object-Experiencer sentences. Results suggest that AD patients may have an impairment in more fine-grained aspects of verb-semantic representation, such as thematic roles. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

White-matter diffusion abnormalities in temporal-lobe epilepsy with and without mesial temporal sclerosis	JOURNAL OF NEUROLOGY NEUROSURGERY AND PSYCHIATRY			English	Article							LIMBIC SYSTEM; QUANTITATIVE MRI; FIBER TRACKING; TENSOR; ATROPHY; BRAIN; DEGRADATION; MODEL	Background: Although epilepsy is considered a grey-matter disorder, changes in the underlying brain connectivity have important implications in seizure generation and propagation. Abnormalities in the temporal and extratemporal white matter of patients with temporal-lobe epilepsy (TLE) and mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS) have previously been identified. Patients with TLE but without MTS often show a different course of the disorder and worse surgical outcome than patients with MTS. The purpose of this study was to determine if saidwhite-matter abnormalities are related to the presence of MTS or if they are also present in non-lesional TLE. Methods: Seventeen patients with TLE and MTS (TLE+uMTS), 13 patients with non-lesional TLE (nl-TLE) and 25 controls were included in the study. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was used to assess tract integrity of the fornix, cingulum, external capsules and the corpus callosum. Results: The white-matter abnormalities seen in the fornix appear to be exclusive to patients with MTS. Although the cingulum showed an abnormally high overall diffusivity in both TLE groups, its anisotropy was decreased only in the TLE+uMTS group in a pattern similar to the fornix. The frontal and temporal components of the corpus callosum, as well as the external capsules, demonstrated reduced anisotropy in TLE regardless of MTS. Conclusions: While some white-matter bundles are affected equally in both forms of TLE, abnormalities of the bundles directly related to the mesial temporal structures (ie, the fornix and cingulum) appear to be unique to TLE+uMTS.

The pontomedullary reticular formation contributes to the compensatory postural responses observed following removal of the support surface in the standing cat. J Neurophysiol 101: 1334-1350, 2009. First published December 31, 2008; doi:10.1152/jn.91013.2008. This study was designed to determine the contribution of reticular neurons in the pontomedullary reticular formation (PMRF) to the postural responses produced to compensate for an unexpected perturbation. We recorded the activity of 48 neurons in the PMRF, including 41 reticulospinal neurons, to removal of the support surface under each of the four limbs in four cats. The perturbations produced robust postural responses that were divided into three periods: an initial postural response (P1) that displaced the center of vertical pressure over the two diagonal supporting limbs; a secondary response (P2) during which the cat restored a tripedal support pattern; and a prolonged tertiary response (P3) that maintained a stable posture over all three supporting limbs. Most (44/48) reticular neurons showed modified activity to perturbation of at least one limb and a majority (39/48) showed changes in activity to perturbations of more than one limb. A few (7/48) discharged to perturbations of all four limbs. Discharge frequency in neurons showing increased activity during P1 was relatively high (> 100 Hz in 57% of the neurons responding to perturbations of either the left or right forelimbs, lF1 and rFL) and of short latency (17 ms for the lFL and 14 ms for the rFL). Discharge activity in most neurons was sustained throughout P2 and P3 but at a reduced level. These data show that neurons in the PMRF discharge strongly in response to unexpected perturbations and in a manner consistent with a contribution to the compensatory responses that restore equilibrium.

Previous data have shown that the inductive effect of human immunodeficiency virus protease inhibitors (Pls) is mediated through the human orphan nuclear receptor, steroid xenobiotic receptor (SXR or hPXR). The objectives of this study were to investigate transport and inductive properties on efflux drug transporters of two Pis, atazanavir and ritonavir, at the blood-brain barrier by using a human brain microvessel endothelial cell line, hCMEC/D3. Transport properties of Pis by the drug efflux transporters P-gp and multidrug resistance protein 1 (MRP1) were assessed by measuring the cellular uptake of (3)H-atazanavir or (3)H-ritonavir in P-gp and MRP1 overexpressing cells as well as hCMEC/D3. Whereas the P-gp inhibitor, PSC833, increased atazanavir and ritonavir accumulation in hCMEC/D3 cells by 2-fold, the MRP inhibitor MK571 had no effect. P-gp, MRP1, and hPXR expression and localization were examined by Western blot analysis and immunogold cytochemistry at the electron microscope level. Treatment of hCMEC/D3 cells for 72 hr with rifampin or SR12813 (two well-established hPXR ligands) or Pis (atazanavir or ritonavir) resulted in an increase in P-gp expression by 1.8-, 6-, and 2-fold, respectively, with no effect observed for MRP1 expression. In hCMEC/D3 cells, cellular accumulation of these Pis appears to be primarily limited by P-gp efflux activity. Long-term exposure of atazanavir or ritonavir to brain microvessel endothelium may result in further limitations in brain drug permeability as a result of the up-regulation of P-gp expression and function.

Methods: We identified papers for review through the PubMed database. Results: Twenty-nine studies examined 10 genes (DRD4, DAT1, COMT, DBH, MAOA, DRD5, ADRA2A, GRIN2A, BDNF and TPH2) in relation to neuropsychological traits relevant for ADHD. For DRD4, the continuous performance test (CPT) and derived tasks were the most used tests. Association of high reaction time variability with the 7-repeat allele absence appears to be the most consistent result and seems to be specific to ADHD. Speed of processing, set-shifting and cognitive impulsiveness were less frequently investigated but seem to be altered in the 7-repeat allele carriers. No effect of genotype was found on response inhibition (the stop and go/no-go tasks). For DAT1, 4 studies provide conflicting results in relation to omission and commission errors from CPT and derived tasks. High reaction time variability seems to be the most replicated cognitive marker associated with the 10-repeat homozygosity. The other genes have attracted fewer studies, and the reported findings need to be replicated. Limitations: Although we aimed to perform a formal meta-analysis, this was not possible because the number of studies using the same neurocognitive endophenotypes was limited. We referred only minimally to the various theoretical frameworks in this field of research; more detail would have been beyond the scope of our systematic review. Finally, sample sizes in most of the studies we reviewed were small. Thus, some negative findings could be attributed to a lack of statistical power, and positive results should be considered preliminary until they are replicated in extended samples. Conclusion: Several methodological issues, including measurement errors, developmental changes in cognitive abilities, sex, psychostimulant effects and presence of comorbid conditions, represent confounding factors and may explain conflicting results.

We explored potential links between emotional memory and social anhedonia severity in patients with schizophrenia and in healthy individuals. Methods: Twenty-nine patients with schizophrenia and 27 matched healthy individuals completed the Chapman Revised Social Anhedonia Scale and then performed an emotional face recognition memory task involving happy, sad and neutral face expressions. We calculated emotional memory performance using 2 independent measures: the discrimination accuracy index Pr and the response bias Br. We also measured valence ratings of the face stimuli. We performed correlation analyses using the inter-individual variability in social anhedonia severity and the individual score obtained for each memory performance variable and for each face valence rating condition. Results: Patients with schizophrenia reported higher levels of social anhedonia compared with healthy individuals. They also showed lower recognition accuracy for faces compared with healthy participants. We found no significant correlation between social anhedonia severity and any of the memory performance variables for both patients with schizophrenia and healthy individuals. Regarding potential links between social anhedonia severity and face valence ratings, we found that individuals with elevated social anhedonia had a tendency to rate the face stimuli as more negative. Limitations: Our negative finding may be partly explained by a lack of statistical power owing to our small patient sample. In addition, our patient sample had unusually high estimated IQ scores, which highlights potential issues regarding the generalization of our findings. Finally, we used a yes-no recognition memory task with a very short retention interval delay. Conclusion: Our results suggest that social anhedonia is not directly linked to emotional memory deficits and biases and does not interfere with the modulatory effect of positively valenced emotion on memory.

Design: A structured review revealed 7 rehabilitation journals, which, during the period 2000-2006, published 86 research articles in which the key word "case-control" or "case control" appeared in the title or abstract. For comparison purposes, other english language journals whose titles began with "Archives of" were also searched. Results: the proportion of mislabeled case-control studies in rehabilitation journals was 97% (83 of 86 studies were mislabeled). In contrast, 34% (76 of 221) of case-control studies published in the sample of non-rehabilitation journals were found to be mislabeled. the most frequent type of rehabilitation study misclassified as case-control was a cross-sectional study (56/86) followed by intervention studies (13/86). Discussion: the extent of mislabeling indicates that the case-control design is poorly understood by the rehabilitation community. this is not solely an issue of semantics; mislabeling led to misinterpretation of findings. Conclusion: in rehabilitation, the research questions answered by case-control studies, regarding the etiology of health events, are rarely posed. Rehabilitation researchers must be attentive to issues of design and report correctly on design in publications.

Identifying the direct effects of ammonia on the brain	METABOLIC BRAIN DISEASE			English	Article						Ammonia; Brain; Liver failure; Hepatic encephalopathy	ACUTE LIVER-FAILURE; ARTERIAL AMMONIA; INTRACRANIAL HYPERTENSION; HEPATIC-ENCEPHALOPATHY; NEURONS; RATS; HYPERAMMONEMIA; METABOLISM; ASTROCYTES; ASPARTATE	Elevated concentrations of ammonia in the brain as a result of hyperammonemia leads to cerebral dysfunction involving a spectrum of neuropsychiatric and neurological symptoms (impaired memory, shortened attention span, sleep-wake inversions, brain edema, intracranial hypertension, seizures, ataxia and coma). Many studies have demonstrated ammonia as a major player involved in the neuropathophysiology associated with liver failure and inherited urea cycle enzyme disorders. Ammonia in solution is composed of a gas (NH(3)) and an ionic (NH(4) (+)) component which are both capable of crossing plasma membranes through diffusion, channels and transport mechanisms and as a result have a direct effect on pH. Furthermore, NH(4) (+) has similar properties as K(+) and, therefore, competes with K(+) on K(+) transporters and channels resulting in a direct effect on membrane potential. Ammonia is also a product as well as a substrate for many different biochemical reactions and consequently, an increase in brain ammonia accompanies disturbances in cerebral metabolism. These direct effects of elevated ammonia concentrations on the brain will lead to a cascade of secondary effects and encephalopathy.

Thiamine deficiency-related brain dysfunction in chronic liver failure	METABOLIC BRAIN DISEASE			English	Article						Thiamine deficiency; Wernicke's encephalopathy; Chronic liver disease; Cirrhosis; Cerebellar degeneration; Lactate; alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase	CEREBROSPINAL-FLUID LACTATE; NITRIC-OXIDE SYNTHASE; WERNICKES ENCEPHALOPATHY; RATS; METABOLISM; ANASTOMOSIS; ALCOHOLICS; INDUCTION; ACIDOSIS; COMPLEX	End-stage chronic liver failure results in thiamine deficiency caused principally by depletion of liver thiamine stores. Chronic liver failure also leads to increased brain ammonia concentrations. Both ammonia and thiamine deficiency result in decreased activity of alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, a rate-limiting tricarboxylic acid cycle enzyme. Loss of enzyme activity results in a mitochondrial oxidative deficit in brain and consequent increases in brain lactate, oxidative/nitrosative stress, cellular energy impairment and release of proinflammatory cytokines, all of which have been described in brain in end-stage chronic liver failure. Synergistic effects of ammonia exposure and thiamine deficiency could explain the diencephalic and cerebellar symptomatology described in patients with "hepatic encephalopathy". Unsuspected brain lesions due to thiamine deficiency could explain the incomplete resolution of neuropsychiatric symptoms following the use of ammonia-lowering agents or liver transplantation in patients with end-stage chronic liver failure. These findings underscore the need for prompt, effective thiamine supplementation in all patients with chronic liver failure.

This new high-yield fabrication process uses commercially available ultra-thin silicon wafers as substrate material. A xenon difluoride system is used to etch the silicon substrate to form the electrode structures. The novel concept of structural reinforcement to produce elongated and reliable probe electrodes is introduced. The authors demonstrate recording silicon electrodes that can reach lengths longer than 10 mm having only 50 mm thicknesses and an 100 mm average width. This new microfabrication process illustrates a simple, cost-effective and mass-producible method for developing ultralong silicon probes for deep brain implantation and neural recording.

In humans, childhood abuse alters HPA stress responses and increases the risk of suicide. We examined epigenetic differences in a neuron-specific glucocorticoid receptor (NR3C1) promoter between postmortem hippocampus obtained from suicide victims with a history of childhood abuse and those from either suicide victims with no childhood abuse or controls. We found decreased levels of glucocorticoid receptor mRNA, as well as mRNA transcripts bearing the glucocorticoid receptor 1(F) splice variant and increased cytosine methylation of an NR3C1 promoter. Patch-methylated NR3C1 promoter constructs that mimicked the methylation state in samples from abused suicide victims showed decreased NGFI-A transcription factor binding and NGFI-A-inducible gene transcription. These findings translate previous results from rat to humans and suggest a common effect of parental care on the epigenetic regulation of hippocampal glucocorticoid receptor expression.

We witness exciting times, as neuroscience begins embracing a position, long-held in cognitive psychology, that recognizes memory as a principally dynamic process. In light of remaining controversy, we here establish that the same operational definitions and types of evidence underpin the deduction of both reconsolidation and consolidation, thus validating the extrapolation that post-retrieval memory plasticity reflects processes akin to those that stabilized the memory following acquisition.

It has been proposed that antidepressant effects of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) can be accelerated by blocking 5-HT(1A/B) autoreceptors with pindolol. The underlying mechanism is thought to involve acute unrestricting of 5-HT release and, consequently, relatively enhanced 5-HT turnover throughout the forebrain serotonergic networks. The effect of this combination on 5-HT turnover in sham operated or OBX rats can be assessed at the level of 5-HT synthesis, a very important presynaptic step in serotonergic neurotransmission, using the alpha-[(14)C]methyl-L-tryptophan autoradiography method. In sham rats, acute citalopram (20 mg/kg) treatment increased synthesis at almost all serotonergic terminal regions but slightly decreased synthesis at serotonergic cell body regions (i.e. dorsal and median (not significant) raphe; similar to 16%). Combining pindolol (10 mg/kg) with citalopram further increased synthesis at many regions in sham rats (relative to treatment with only citalopram). In OBX rats, citalopram decreased synthesis at a few terminal regions and greatly decreased synthesis at the dorsal and median raphe (similar to 45%; relative to OBX rats treated with saline). Combining pindolol with citalopram greatly increased synthesis at almost all regions in OBX rats (relative to treatment with only citalopram). These results suggest that acute citalopram effects result in elevated terminal 5-HT synthesis, but these effects are restrained by 5-HT(1A/B) autoreceptor feedback to different degrees in sham and OBX rats. Moreover, 5-HT(1A/B) autoreceptor feedback is stronger in OBX rats and may underlie the delay of SSRI effects in OBX rats and, correspondingly, in human depression. Pindolol acceleration and augmentation of SSRI antidepressant therapy for human depression may be mediated by attenuation of 5-HT1A/B autoreceptor feedback, permitting unhindered SSRI effects on serotonergic terminals.

In addition results were compared to those previously reported in normal Sprague-Dawley (SPD) rats (normal control). Serotonin synthesis in both FSL and FRL rats was measured following acute and chronic treatments with buspirone. Both of these strains were derived from the SPD rats. No direct comparison was done between the FSL saline and FRIL saline groups, or the FSL buspirone and FRL buspirone groups, because the objective of the studies was to evaluate effects of buspirone in these two strains. The results show that acute treatment with buspirone elevates 5-HT synthesis throughout the brain in the FRL rats. In the FSL rats, there were reductions in some brain regions (e.g., dorsal and median raphe, amygdala, anterior olfactory nucleus, substantia nigra reticulate), while in other regions, there were increases in the synthesis observed (e.g., frontal, parietal, visual and somatosensory cortices, ventral hippocampus). In 20 out of the 30 brain regions investigated in the FSL rats, there was no significant change in the synthesis following acute buspirone treatment. During the chronic treatment, buspirone produced a significant reduction of 5-HT synthesis in 15 out of 30 brain regions in the FRIL rats. In the FSL rats, buspirone produced a significant elevation of the synthesis in 10 out of 30 brain regions. In both the FSL and FRL rats, buspirone produced rather different effects than those reported previously for SPD (normal) rats. The acute effect in the FSL rats was somewhat similar to the effect reported previously for the SPD rats, while in the FRL rats, the acute buspirone treatment produced an effect observed previously in treatments with 5-HT(1A) antagonists suggesting an action of buspirone as partial agonist in FRL rats. The data suggest that with respect to 5-HT synthesis, FRL rats differ from SPD rats (a natural control; normal rats) and, as such, indicate that when the effects related to the serotonergic system (e.g., influence of serotonergic drugs) are studied in the FSL rats and compared to those in the FRL rats, any conclusions drawn may not reflect differences relative to a normal rat.

Most magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies among middle aged acute depressed patients are based on manual segmentation of the hippocampus. Few studies used automated methods such as voxel-based morphometry (VBM) or automated segmentation that can overcome certain drawbacks of manual segmentation (essentially intra-and inter-rater variability and operator time consumption). Objective: The aim of our study was to compare the sensitivity of manual segmentation, automated segmentation and VBM to detect hippocampal structural changes in middle aged acute depressed population. Method: Twenty-one middle aged depressed inpatients and 21 matched controls were compared regarding their hippocampal structure using VBM with SPM5, manual segmentation and an automated segmentation algorithm. The VBM-ROI analysis was performed using two different normalization methods: the standard approach implemented in SPM5 and the most recent DARTEL algorithm. Results: Using VBM-DARTEL, when corrected for multiple comparisons, significant volume differences were detected between groups in different regions and more specifically in hippocampus with ROI analyses. Whereas using standard VBM (without DARTEL), ROI analyses did not show bilateral volume between group differences. Significant hippocampal volume reductions between patients and controls were also detected using manual segmentation (-11.6% volume reduction, p<0.05) and automated segmentation (-9.7% volume reduction, pb0.05). VBM-DARTEL and automated segmentation show equal sensitivity in detecting hippocampal differences in depressed patients, while standard VBM was unable to detect hippocampal changes. Both VBM-DARTEL and automated segmentation could be used to perform large scale volumetric studies in humans. The new automated segmentation technique could further explore and detect hippocampal subpart differences that could be very useful for clarifying physiopathology of psychiatric disorders.

Several of those brain areas may also contribute to the monitoring and regulation of autonomic activity but this aspect of pain responses has been largely overlooked in human imaging studies. This functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study relied on blood-oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal to investigate subject-related differences in brain activity associated with the individual differences in electrodermal responses evoked by 30 s noxious (pain) and innocuous (warm) thermal stimuli. Pain-related activity (pain-warm) was found in the thalamus, somatosensory cortices (leg area of SI/MI, SII, and insula), the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and the amygdala. Brain activation related to stimulus-evoked electrodermal activity was identified by modeling the predicted BOLD responses with the magnitude of each subject's skin conductance reactivity. Subjects showing larger skin conductance reactivity to the innocuous and/or noxious stimuli displayed larger stimulus-evoked brain responses in the somato-motor cortices (SI/MI, SII, and insula), the perigenual and supracallosal ACC, the orbitofrontal cortex and the medulla. Further analyses revealed brain activation more specifically associated with the pain-related skin conductance reactivity in the supracallosal ACC, amygdala, thalamus, and hypothalamus. These findings demonstrate that individual differences in electrodermal reactivity partly reflect differences in pain-evoked brain responses, consistent with a role of these structures in the monitoring/regulation of pain-related autonomic processes.

In this study, we examine the mechanisms underlying this effect, in particular the roles of cholecystokinin (CCK) and nerve growth factor (NGF), in an animal model of central nervous system (CNS) inflammation induced by spinal administration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Although spinal administration of LY-225910 (25 ng), a CCK-B antagonist, enhanced morphine analgesia in naive rats, it was unable to do so in LPS-treated animals. Conversely, spinal CCK-8S administration (1 ng) decreased morphine analgesia in LPS-treated rats, but not in naive animals. Further, spinal anti-NGF (3 mu g) was able to reduce morphine analgesia in LPS-treated rats, but not in naive animals, an effect that was reversed by spinal administration of LY225910. While CCK-8S concentration was increased in spinal cord extracts of LPS animals as compared to controls, morphine-induced spinal CCK release in the extracellular space, as measured by in-vivo spinal cord microdialysis was inhibited in LIPS animals as compared to controls, and this was reversed by anti-NGF pretreatment. Finally, chronic spinal administration of beta-NGF (7 mu g/day) for 7 days enhanced spinal morphine analgesia, possibly by mimicking a CNS inflammatory state. We suggest that in intrathecally LPS-treated rats, spinal CCK release is altered resulting in enhanced morphine analgesia, and that this mechanism may be regulated to an important extent by NGF.

Pain research from 1975 to 2007: A categorical and bibliometric meta-trend analysis of every Research Paper published in the journal, Pain	PAIN			English	Article						Pain research; Meta-analysis; Trend analysis; Bibliometric analysis		In an attempt to characterize the nature of pain research, every one of the 4525 Research Papers published in the journal, Pain, from its inception until the end of 2007, was examined by a single individual using a consistent set of criteria, and was coded for its essential features in four domains: the purpose of the study (e.g., characterization of a pain syndrome, evaluation of the role of a molecule), the subjects of the study (patients, human "normals", animals), the pain states characterized or induced (clinical pain and experimental stimuli), and the dependent measures examined (e.g., behaviors, questionnaires, neural firing). For papers involving pain patients, the clinical conditions under study were coded as well. These categorical data were combined with bibliometric data obtained from citation databases.

The Relationship between Empathy and Estimates of Observed Pain	PAIN MEDICINE			English	Article						Facial Cues; Pain Communication; Empathy; Observed Pain; Accuracy	FACIAL EXPRESSION; PERSPECTIVE-TAKING; NEURAL BASIS; OTHERS PAIN; SELF-REPORT; PERCEPTION; EXPERIENCE; COMMUNICATION; PROFESSIONALS; SENSITIVITY	Recent research suggests that higher scores on measures of empathy correlate with a stronger response to observed pain, as well as higher estimates of pain intensity. Little work to date has examined the impact of empathy on evaluations of different levels of expressed pain, or how empathy may alter the accuracy of interpreting these painful facial expressions. This study examines the role of empathy in rating the intensity of facial expressions of pain, and the accuracy of these ratings relative to self-reported pain. The potential mediating role of available pain cues or the moderating role of gender on this relationship are also examined. Undergraduate participants (observers, N = 130) were shown video clips of facial expressions of individuals from a cold presser pain task (senders), and then asked to estimate that pain experience. This estimate was compared with the video sender's actual pain ratings. Higher empathy was associated with an overall increase in estimates of senders' pain, which was not mediated by video subject or participant gender or the duration of painful facial expressions. Further analyses revealed that high empathy was associated with greater accuracy in inferring pain on only one of three inferential accuracy indices. While observers with greater empathy may infer greater pain in senders, resulting in a smaller underestimation bias overall, they are not necessarily more accurate in estimating pain on any given stimuli. The importance of these potential differences in perceived pain for clinical assessment and interpersonal relationships are discussed.	[Green, A.

Multiple intrinsic and extrinsic factors challenge our prognostic certainty, which then challenges our ability both to communicate and to make decisions that are rooted in basic principles of fairness and moral integrity. Clinical vignettes illustrate the difficulties and highlight the present status regarding prognostication and consideration of general ethical principles that would permit the consensual withdrawal of care (i.e., end-of-life decisions). Futility in the neonatal setting is examined, as well the mechanisms of the decision-making process and existing relevant professional guidelines. (C) 2009 by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

These seizures are in most cases repetitive or associated with asymptomatic electrographic seizures. Despite the relative resistance of the immature brain to seizure-induced brain damage, there is more and more evidence that neonatal seizures impair normal brain development. This review addresses the changes associated with neonatal seizures and discusses current and future potential neuroprotective strategies. (C) 2009 by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The rationale for the study design is provided as well as a summary of the procedures used to evaluate these children prior to surgery, at discharge after surgery, 12-18 months later, and at 5 years of age. Results demonstrate that a substantial proportion of these infants had neurologic and developmental abnormalities prior to surgical repair. Developmental delays were common in children with both cyanotic and acyanotic heart defects, and these deficits persisted to school entry. A number of medical, surgical, demographic and environmental factors were significantly associated with developmental outcomes suggesting a multifactorial etiology to brain injury. Limited educational and rehabilitation resources for this cohort at early school age suggests that service needs may need to be more carefully planned for this high-risk population. Lessons learnt from this prospective study are highlighted as well as future directions for research and clinical practice. (C) 2009 by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Methods: Infants (n = 100) born at less than 32 weeks postconceptional age were assessed at term using the General Movements Assessment, Einstein Neonatal Neurobehavioral Assessment Scales, Test of Infant Motor Performance, and at 12 months adjusted age using the Alberta Infant Motor Scales, Peabody Developmental Motor Scales-2, Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales-Daily Living Skills, and Battelle Developmental Inventory. Results: The General Movements Assessment (r(2) = 0.04; p = 0.05) and the Test of Infant Motor Performance (r(2) = 0.05; p = 0.04) predicted outcomes on the Peabody Developmental Motor Scales-2. The Test of Infant Motor Performance predicted outcomes on the Alberta Infant Motor Scales (r(2) = 0.05; p = 0.04) and Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales-Daily Living Skills (odds ratio: 0.93). Delays in functional performance were found. Conclusions: Neonatal tests at term explained a small but significant proportion of the variance in gross motor and daily living skills at 12 months adjusted age.

Brain regions associated with AMPH-induced locomotor activity express high levels of retinoid receptors. However, the role of these transcription factors in dopamine-mediated effects remains poorly understood. Two nuclear receptor families, the retinoic acid receptors (RAR) and the retinoid X receptors (RXR), transduce retinoic acid signal. RARs are specifically involved in retinoid signaling, whereas RXRs also participate in other signaling pathways as partners for other nuclear receptors such as Nur77, an orphan member of the nuclear receptor family expresses in dopamine system. To explore the role of retinoid receptors and Nur77 in AMPH-induced locomotor activity, we administered selective retinoid receptor drugs in combination with AMPH in adult wild-type and Nur77-deficient mice. At a low dose, AMPH similarly increased ambulatory activity in wild-type and Nur77-deficient mice, while it did not alter non-ambulatory activity. At a high dose, AMPH did not alter ambulatory activity anymore, while non-ambulatory activity strongly increased in wild-type mice. Nur77-deficient mice still displayed a higher ambulatory activity with no change in non-ambulatory activity. HX531, a synthetic RXR antagonist, blocks AMPH-induced ambulatory activity, whereas RAR drugs tested remained without effect. Interestingly, the effect of HX531 was abolished in Nur77-deficient mice, suggesting that this orphan nuclear receptor is essential for the action of the RXR drug. This study shows that RXR and Nur77 participate in AMPH-induced locomotor activity and prompts for further investigations on the role of Nur77 and RXR in addiction and reward-related behaviors.

However, animal data also indicate that MA can damage brain serotonin neurones, and it has been suggested that cognitive problems and aggression in MA users might be explained by serotonergic damage. As information on the brain serotonin system in human MA users is fragmentary, our objective was to determine whether protein levels of serotonin transporter (SERT), a key marker of serotonin neurones, are decreased in brain of chronic MA users. SERT immunoreactivity was measured using an immunoblotting procedure in autopsied brain of 16 chronic MA users testing positive for the drug in blood and brain and matched controls. SERT levels were non-significantly decreased (-14% to -33%) in caudate, putamen and thalamus (normal in hippocampus), and, unlike the robust striatal dopamine reduction, there was marked overlap between control and MA user ranges. Concentrations of SERT were significantly decreased (-23% to -39%) in orbitofrontal and occipital cortices (normal in frontopolar and temporal cortices). Our data suggest that MA might modestly damage brain serotonin neurones and/or inhibit SERT protein expression, with cerebral cortex being more affected than sub-cortical regions. The SERT reduction in orbitofrontal cortex complements other data suggesting involvement of this area in MA-related behaviour. Decreased brain SERT could also be related to the clinical finding that treatment with a selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor might increase relapse to MA.

Aphasia onset is generally followed by some degree of recovery. State of art. - Prognosis of recovery is considered to depend upon a series of interacting neurobiological and individual factors. Prognosis is better determined based on neurobiological factors, whereas individual factors have a less predictable clinical outcome value. in addition, the results of recent functional neuro-imaging studies allow us to better understand the functional anatomy of the recovery from vascular aphasia. The neuro-imaging literature suggests that recovery from aphasia could depend upon right homologous to language areas, as well as on preserved perilesional left hemisphere regions. The role of either hemisphere seems to be modulated by time elapsed after brain damage, and language processing domain. Further, increasing evidence suggests that intensive and specific language therapy may interact with brain plasticity to promote recovery in chronic and severe aphasia. Perspective and conclusion. - A better understanding of the factors determining recovery from aphasia will contribute to optimizing intervention and, consequently improve the quality of life of people with aphasia.

Design: Overnight sleep recordings were conducted in 15 children diagnosed with ADHD (DSM-IV) without comorbid psychiatric problems and in 23 healthy controls aged 7 to 11 years. Children were on no medication, in good health and did not consume products containing caffeine ? 7 days prior to the polysomnography (PSG) study. PSG evaluation was performed at each child's home; children slept in their regular beds and went to bed at their habitual bedtimes. Measurements: Standard overnight multichannel PSG evaluation was performed using a portable polysomnography device. In addition, parents were asked to complete a sleep questionnaire. Results: Compared to controls, children in the ADHD group had significantly shorter duration of REM sleep, smaller percentage of total sleep time spent in REM sleep, and shorter sleep duration, In addition, the ADHD group had higher scores on the insufficient sleep and sleep anxiety factors than children in the control group. Conclusion: The present findings support the hypothesis that children with ADHD present sleep disturbances.

Using behavioral measures and 3T functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we examined whether such deficits extend to the perception of bodily expressed emotions. We found that individuals with ASD, in contrast to neurotypical (NT) individuals, did not exhibit a differential pattern of brain activation to bodies expressing fear as compared with emotionally neutral bodies. ASD and NT individuals showed similar patterns of activation in response to bodies engaged in emotionally neutral actions, with the exception of decreased activation in the inferior frontal cortex and the anterior insula in ASD. We discuss these findings in relation to possible abnormalities in a network of cortical and subcortical mechanisms involved in social orienting and emotion contagion. Our data suggest that emotion perception deficits in ASD may be due to compromised processing of the emotional component of observed actions.

Almost nothing is known about the effects that antidepressants have on cognition, affect, or motivation when used over a period of months or years. Nor do we understand what effects, if any, antidepressants have on what we think of as the self. In this article, we argue that neither psychiatry nor philosophy, in their current state, are well equipped to think about these issues. In order to explore this idea, we consider the neurobiology of romantic love and its relation to antidepressant neurochemistry. This case study, we suggest, supports the view that antidepressants are very likely to have significant effects on personhood as well as the suggestion that we are in need of new ways of thinking about the self and its pathologies.

Examining this issue under the rubric of an 'anthropology of uncertainty,' this article seeks to address the question: how do doctors prescribe medications given tensions created by uncertainty? A partial answer is drawn from research conducted in Brazil with local psychogeriatricians, which has documented a high degree of certainty regarding Alzheimer drugs and their benefits. I argue that one reason for this certainty is that 'efficacy' has become increasingly non-specific in Alzheimer's disease through the broadening of outcome measures in clinical trials. While such measures previously focused on cognitive symptoms, they now encompass concepts such as functionality, quality of life and activities of daily living. The certainty of the Brazilian psychogeriatricians is further buttressed by three interacting elements: (i) the influence of the pharmaceutical industry; (ii) long-standing arguments for including non-cognitive symptoms in dementia care and research; and (iii) a specific discourse found in geriatrics and gerontology, which recognizes 'the person beyond cognition:	Univ Montreal, Fac Sci Infirm, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada	Leibing, A (reprint author), Univ Montreal, Fac Sci Infirm, CP 6147,Succ Ctr Ville, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada.	annette.leibing@umontreal.ca						86	10	10	3	10	SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD	LONDON	1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND	1363-4615	1461-7471		TRANSCULT PSYCHIATRY	Transcult.

Ten percent of cases are inherited; most involve unidentified genes. We report here 13 mutations in the fused in sarcoma/translated in liposarcoma (FUS/TLS) gene on chromosome 16 that were specific for familial ALS. The FUS/TLS protein binds to RNA, functions in diverse processes, and is normally located predominantly in the nucleus. In contrast, the mutant forms of FUS/TLS accumulated in the cytoplasm of neurons, a pathology that is similar to that of the gene TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP43), whose mutations also cause ALS. Neuronal cytoplasmic protein aggregation and defective RNA metabolism thus appear to be common pathogenic mechanisms involved in ALS and possibly in other neurodegenerative disorders.

Behavior of Parasite-Specific Effector CD8(+) T Cells in the Brain and Visualization of a Kinesis-Associated System of Reticular Fibers	IMMUNITY			English	Article							EXPERIMENTAL AUTOIMMUNE ENCEPHALOMYELITIS; LYMPH-NODE; TOXOPLASMA-GONDII; IN-VIVO; MIGRATION; MOTILITY; INFECTION; ANTIGEN; TRAFFICKING; COLLAGEN	To understand lymphocyte behavior in the brain, we used two-photon microscopy to visualize effector CD8(+) T cells during toxoplasmic encephalitis. These cells displayed multiple behaviors with two distinct populations of cells apparent: one with a constrained pattern of migration and one with a highly migratory subset. The proportion of these populations varied over time associated with changes in antigen availability as well as T cell expression of the inhibitory receptor PD1. Unexpectedly, the movement of infiltrating cells was closely associated with an infection-induced reticular system of fibers. This observation suggests that, whereas in other tissues pre-existing scaffolds exist that guide lymphocyte migration, in the brain specialized structures are induced by inflammation that guide migration of T cells in this immune-privileged environment.

To help clarify these diverse roles in the assembly and function of the hippocampus, we examined the cellular and subcellular localization of EphA4 in postnatal rat hippocampus by light and electron microscopic immunocytochemistry. On postnatal day (P) 1, the EphA4 immunostaining was robust in most layers of CA1, CA3, and dentate gyrus and then decreased gradually, until P21, especially in the cell body layers. At the ultrastructural level, focal spots of EphA4 immunoreactivity were detected all over the plasma membrane of pyramidal and granule cells, between P1 and P14, from the perikarya to the dendritic and axonal extremities, including growth cones and filopodia. This cell surface immunoreactivity then became restricted to the synapse-associated dendritic spines and axon terminals by P21. In astrocytes, the EphA4 immunolabeling showed a similar cell surface redistribution, from the perikarya and large processes at P-1-P7, to small perisynaptic processes at P14-P21. In both cell types, spots of EphA4 immunoreactivity were also detected, with an incidence decreasing with maturation, on the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, and vesicles, organelles involved in protein synthesis, posttranslational modifications, and transport. The cell surface evolution of EphA4 localization in neuronal and glial cells is consistent with successive involvements in the developmental movements of cell bodies first, followed by process outgrowth and guidance, synaptogenesis, and finally synaptic maintenance and plasticity.

Although heterozygous carriers of nonsense mutations in the HSN2 gene, called with-no-lysine(K)-1 (WNK1), do not develop the disease, historical and experimental evidence suggests that these individuals might perceive somatosensory stimuli differently from others. Using the method-of-limits, we assessed the thresholds for warmth detection, cool detection, heat pain and cold pain in 25 mutation carriers and 35 controls. In group analyses, carriers displayed significantly lower warmth (p < 0.001) and cool (p < 0.05) difference thresholds, and also tended to report cold pain at higher temperatures (p < 0.095), than controls. Similarly, matched-pair analyses showed that carriers are significantly more sensitive to warm stimuli (p < 0.01) and cold pain stimuli (p < 0.05), and tend to be more sensitive to cool stimuli (p < 0.11). Furthermore, the differences between the warmth detection thresholds of the carriers and those of gender- and sex-matched wild types significantly increased with age (r = 0.76, p = 0.02), and in carriers cool detection thresholds did not increase with age (r = 0.27, p = 0.24) as expected and observed in controls (r = 0.34, p = 0.05). This study demonstrates that the carriers of a recessive mutation for HSAN2 display greater sensitivity to innocuous thermal stimuli, as well as for cold pain, suggesting a possible environmental adaptive advantage of the heterozygous state.

Using in-vivo voltammetry, increases in extracellular dopamine release in response to predator odour and tail pinch stress were recorded bilaterally and simultaneously in either the infralimbic cortex or basolateral amygdala. In both stress-sensitive brain regions, significant sex x hemisphere interactions were observed, with males and females showing greater dopamine activation in right-brain and left-brain structures, respectively. Cortical asymmetries in dopamine release also showed sex-specific correlations with stress-induced neuroendocrine activation. Given the intriguing human parallels, we suggest that differential cerebral lateralization may be highly relevant to the disproportionately high incidence of stress-related disorders such as depression and anxiety seen in women.

Melanin-concentrating hormone neurons discharge in a reciprocal manner to orexin neurons across the sleep-wake cycle	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						hypocretin; narcolepsy; paradoxical sleep; REM sleep; slow wave sleep	GENE-EXPRESSION; LATERAL HYPOTHALAMUS; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; HYPOCRETIN NEURONS; FEEDING-BEHAVIOR; MICE; NARCOLEPSY; RATS; DEPRIVATION; ARCHITECTURE	Neurons containing melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) are codistributed with neurons containing orexin (Orx or hypocretin) in the lateral hypothalamus, a peptide and region known to be critical for maintaining wakefulness. Evidence from knockout and c-Fos studies suggests, however, that the MCH neurons might play a different role than Orx neurons in regulating activity and sleep wake states. To examine this possibility, neurons were recorded across natural sleep-wake states in head-fixed rats and labeled by using the juxtacellular technique for subsequent immunohistochemical identification. Neurons identified as MCH+ did not fire during wake (W); they fired selectively during sleep, occasionally during slow wave sleep (SWS) and maximally during paradoxical sleep (PS). As W-Off/Sleep-On, the MCH neurons discharged in a reciprocal manner to the W-On/Sleep-Off Orx neurons and could accordingly play a complementary role to Orx neurons in sleep wake state regulation and contribute to the pathophysiology of certain sleep disorders, such as narcolepsy with cataplexy.

The centromedian (centre median, CM) and parafascicular (Pf) nuclei are an important source of thalamostriatal projections. Anterograde tract-tracing indicates the CM-Pf complex provides dense afferents to the matrix compartment of the striatum. Whereas CM projects to the entire sensorimotor territory of the striatum, the Pf provides complementary input to the entire associative sector. The Pf also provides lighter input to the nucleus accumbens. Both CM and Pf provide light to moderately dense inputs to other components of the basal ganglia in a largely complementary manner, covering motor or associative-limbic territories of the subthalamic nucleus, globus pallidus and ventral midbrain. In turn, the CM and Pf receive mainly segregated input from parallel motor and associative-limbic circuits of the basal ganglia. The CM and Pf may therefore be considered important participants in parallel processing of motor and associative-limbic information in the basal ganglia. Connections of the CM and Pf with other thalamic nuclei suggest they also participate in integrative functions within the thalamus. In addition, inputs from the brainstem reticular core, reciprocal connections with the cerebral cortex and reticular thalamic nucleus suggest a role in state-dependant information processing. Consideration of the differential connections of the CM and Pf, and better understanding of their role in pathophysiology, may eventually lead to development of an important new target for relief of a variety of neurological and psychiatric disorders.

Hand1 and Hand2 are expressed by a subset of neural crest cells in the anterior branchial arches and are involved in craniofacial development. However, the precise mechanisms by which Hand proteins mediate biological actions and regulate downstream target genes in branchial arches is largely unknown. Here, we report that Hand2 negatively regulates intramembranous ossification of the mandible by directly inhibiting the transcription factor Runx2, a master regulator of osteoblast differentiation. Hand proteins physically interact with Runx2, suppressing its DNA binding and transcriptional activity. This interaction is mediated by the N-terminal domain of the Hand protein and requires neither dimerization with other bHLH proteins nor DNA binding. We observed partial colocalization of Hand2 and Runx2 in the mandibular primordium of the branchial arch, and downregulation of Hand2 precedes Runx2-driven osteoblast differentiation. Hand2 hypomorphic mutant mice display insufficient mineralization and ectopic bone formation in the mandible due to accelerated osteoblast differentiation, which is associated with the upregulation and ectopic expression of Runx2 in the mandibular arch. Here, we show that Hand2 acts as a novel inhibitor of the Runx2-DNA interaction and thereby regulates osteoblast differentiation in branchial arch development.

Rostral and caudal pharyngeal arches share a common neural crest ground pattern	DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Hox genes; Head morphogenesis; Hyoid bone; Jaw development; Mouse; Neural crest cells	HOX GENE-EXPRESSION; HOMEOTIC TRANSFORMATION; TARGETED DISRUPTION; MEDIATED RECOMBINATION; COMPOUND MUTANTS; VERTEBRATE HEAD; HINDBRAIN; ZEBRAFISH; CELLS; MICE	In vertebrates, face and throat structures, such as jaw, hyoid and thyroid cartilages develop from a rostrocaudal metameric series of pharyngeal arches, colonized by cranial neural crest cells ( NCCs). Colinear Hox gene expression patterns underlie arch specific morphologies, with the exception of the first ( mandibular) arch, which is devoid of any Hox gene activity. We have previously shown that the first and second ( hyoid) arches share a common, Hox-free, patterning program. However, whether or not more posterior pharyngeal arch neural crest derivatives are also patterned on the top of the same ground-state remained an unanswered question. Here, we show that the simultaneous inactivation of all Hoxa cluster genes in NCCs leads to multiple jaw and first arch-like structures, partially replacing second, third and fourth arch derivatives, suggesting that rostral and caudal arches share the same mandibular arch-like ground patterning program. The additional inactivation of the Hoxd cluster did not significantly enhance such a homeotic phenotype, thus indicating a preponderant role of Hoxa genes in patterning skeletogenic NCCs. Moreover, we found that Hoxa2 and Hoxa3 act synergistically to pattern third and fourth arch derivatives. These results provide insights into how facial and throat structures are assembled during development, and have implications for the evolution of the pharyngeal region of the vertebrate head.

Dysbindin-1 mRNA and protein levels are significantly reduced in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus of schizophrenia subjects. To understand the in-vivo functions of dysbindin-1, we studied schizophrenia relevant behaviors in adult male Sandy homozygous (sdy/sdy) and heterozygous (sdy/+) mice that have a natural mutation in dysbindin-1 gene (on a DBA/2J background) resulting in loss of protein expression. Spontaneous locomotor activity of sdy/sdy and sdy/+ mice in novel environment was not significantly different from DBA/2J controls. However, on repeated testing in the same environment for 7 days, sdy/sdy mice, in contrast to DBA/2J controls showed a lack of locomotor habituation. Locomotor activating effect of a low dose of d-amphetamine (2.5 mg/kg ip), a behavioral measure of mesolimbic dopamine activity, was significantly reduced in the mutant mice. Interestingly, sdy/sdy mice showed enhanced locomotor sensitization to repeated five daily injection of amphetamine. Possible cognitive impairment in Sandy mutants was revealed in novel object recognition test as sdy/sdy and sdy/+ mice spent significantly less time exploring novel objects compared to DBA/2J. sdy/sdy mice also showed deficits in emotionally motivated learning and memory showing greater freezing response to auditory conditioned stimulus (CS) in fear conditioning paradigm. in thermal nociceptive test, the latency of paw withdrawal in sdy/sdy and sdy/+ animals was significantly higher compared to DBA/2J indicating hypoalgesia in the mutants. Taken together, these data suggest that dysbindin-1 gene deficiency leads to significant changes in cognition and altered responses to psychostimulants. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A subset of BACE1 localizes to cholesterol-rich membrane microdomains, termed lipid rafts. BACE1 processing in raft microdomains of cultured cells and neurons was characterized in previous studies by disrupting the integrity of lipid rafts by cholesterol depletion. These studies found either inhibition or elevation of A beta production depending on the extent of cholesterol depletion, generating controversy. The intricate interplay between cholesterol levels, APP trafficking, and BACE1 processing is not clearly understood because cholesterol depletion has pleiotropic effects on Golgi morphology, vesicular trafficking, and membrane bulk fluidity. In this study, we used an alternate strategy to explore the function of BACE1 in membrane microdomains without altering the cellular cholesterol level. We demonstrate that BACE1 undergoes S-palmitoylation at four Cys residues at the junction of transmembrane and cytosolic domains, and Ala substitution at these four residues is sufficient to displace BACE1 from lipid rafts. Analysis of wild type and mutant BACE1 expressed in BACE1 null fibroblasts and neuroblastoma cells revealed that S-palmitoylation neither contributes to protein stability nor subcellular localization of BACE1. Surprisingly, non-raft localization of palmitoylation-deficient BACE1 did not have discernible influence on BACE1 processing of APP or secretion of A beta. These results indicate that post-translational S-palmitoylation of BACE1 is not required for APP processing, and that BACE1 can efficiently cleave APP in both raft and non-raft microdomains.

DO Collaboration	Search for Associated W and Higgs Boson Production in p(p)over-bar Collisions at root s=1.96 TeV	PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS			English	Article								We present results of a search for WH -> l nu b (b) over bar production in p (p) over bar collisions based on the analysis of 1.05 fb(-1) of data collected by the D0 experiment at the Fermilab Tevatron, using a neural network for separating the signal from backgrounds. No signal-like excess is observed, and we set 95% C. L. upper limits on the WH production cross section multiplied by the branching ratio for H -> b (b) over bar for Higgs boson masses between 100 and 150 GeV. For a mass of 115 GeV, we obtain an observed (expected) limit of 1.5 (1.4) pb, a factor of 11.4 (10.7) times larger than the standard model prediction.	[Abazov, V. M.; Alexeev, G. D.; Kharzheev, Y.

Studies have also shown an inverse relationship between alcohol use and cerebrospinal fluid levels of serotonin metabolites, suggesting that chronic alcohol consumption produces alterations in serotonin synthesis or release. The objective of the study was to characterize regional brain serotonin synthesis in nondepressed chronic alcoholics at treatment entry in comparison to normal nonalcoholic controls using PET and the tracer alpha-[(11)C]-methyl-l-tryptophan. Comparisons of the alcoholics and controls by SPM found that there were significant differences in the rate of serotonin synthesis between groups. Serotonin synthesis was significantly lower among alcoholics in Brodmann Area (BA) 9, 10, and 32. However, serotonin synthesis among the alcoholics group was significantly higher than controls at BA19 in the occipital lobe and around the transverse temporal convolution in the left superior temporal gyrus (BA41). In addition, there were correlations between regional serotonin synthesis and a quantity-frequency measure of alcohol consumption. Regions showing a significant negative correlation with QF included the bilateral rectus gyri (BA11) in the orbitofrontal area, the bilateral medial frontal area (BA6), and the right amygdala. Current alcoholism is associated with serotonergic abnormalities in brain regions that are known to be involved in planning, judgment, self-control, and emotional regulation.

Central vs. Bilateral Endoscopic Ultrasound-Guided Celiac Plexus Block or Neurolysis: A Comparative Study of Short-Term Effectiveness	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF GASTROENTEROLOGY			English	Article							CHRONIC-PANCREATITIS; ABDOMINAL-PAIN	OBJECTIVES: Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)-guided celiac plexus block/neurolysis (CPB/N) can be performed by injecting at the base (central) or on either side (bilateral) of the celiac axis. Central CPB/N is easier and possibly safer. Bilateral CPB/N is more difficult but may be more effective as it reaches more ganglia. The aim of this study was to compare the short-term safety and efficacy of central and bilateral CPB/N. METHODS: Consecutive patients referred for CPB/N to a quaternary EUS center were eligible for this study. Central CPB/N was used in the first half of the study period and bilateral CPB/N in the last half. The primary outcome was the percent reduction in visual analog pain scores at day 7. RESULTS: A total of 184 patients were eligible. Of these, 24 (13%) were excluded for incomplete data. A total of 160 were left (71 central, 89 bilateral). The groups were similar for all cogent variables. Bilateral CPB/N was more effective than central CPB/N (mean percent pain reduction 70.4% (61.0-80.0) vs. 45.9% (32.7-57.4); P = 0.0016). The only predictor of a > 50% pain reduction was bilateral CPB/N (odds ratio 3.55, 1.72-7.34). Only one complication was noted: self-limited bleeding because of laceration of the adrenal artery following bilateral celiac plexus (CP) block in an anticoagulated patient. CONCLUSIONS: (i) Bilateral CPB/N is more effective than central CPB/N; (ii) bilateral CPB/N is safe, but on rare occasions can cause trauma to the left adrenal artery; it should therefore be avoided in patients with a bleeding diathesis.

Endovascular Coiling of Cerebral Aneurysms Using "Bioactive" or Coated-Coil Technologies: A Systematic Review of the Literature	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY			English	Review							MATRIX DETACHABLE COILS; SINGLE-CENTER EXPERIENCE; RUPTURED INTRACRANIAL ANEURYSMS; INITIAL CLINICAL-EXPERIENCE; PLATINUM COILS; FOLLOW-UP; TRIAL ISAT; RISK-FACTORS; EMBOLIZATION; HYDROCOIL	Second-generation coils have been available since 2002. We wanted to assess their performance and appraise available evidence. Therefore we performed a systematic review of the literature from 2002 to 2007. There were 27 studies with a total of 2390 patients that met pre-specified inclusion criteria. All studies were classed as having a high risk of bias. There were no randomized trials and for most studies results were not independently assessed and follow-up periods were short (mean 7 months). There were large differences in demographic and aneurysm characteristics, making comparisons between coil cohorts difficult, Procedure-related morbidity and mortality were similar for all coil types. Hemorrhagic events during follow-up were few, in the range of 1 %/year for all coil types. The available literature is of poor quality and clinical series provide very little evidence in favor of second-generation coils.

Pearson			Measurement of Ring A-Reduced Progesterone Metabolites by Enzyme-Linked Immunoassay with Colorimetric Detection: Baseline Levels of Six Metabolites, Including Pregnanolone, in Male Rat Plasma	ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							GABA(A) RECEPTOR FUNCTION; OLFACTORY-BULBECTOMIZED RAT; NEUROACTIVE STEROIDS; MAJOR DEPRESSION; CHLORIDE IONOPHORE; ALLOPREGNANOLONE CONCENTRATIONS; ELEVATED LEVELS; BRAIN; NEUROSTEROIDS; STRESS	The performance of an antiserum to progesterone and pregnane neurosteroids was assessed in two competitive assay setups: radioimmunoassay and enzyme-linked immunoassay with colorimetric detection, both with the same limit of detection of 2 pg. The enzyme-linked immunoassay was less labor-intensive and had better precision of measurement and was used to measure progesterone and six of its ring A-reduced metabolites in rat plasma. The measured levels of allopregnanolone and progesterone were in agreement with those reported previously when measured by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry and high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with radioimmunoassay and substantially lower than those previously measured by radioimmunoassay without chromatographic separation. Both isomers of dihydroprogesterone and all four isomers of pregnanolone were detected in rat plasma, indicating that progesterone is metabolized by reduction at the C5 and C3 position of the A ring, in both alpha and beta configurations. In addition to 5 beta-dihydroprogesterone and isopregnanolone, which have not been previously detected in the rate we found considerable amounts of pregnanolone, which is neuroactive, with similar potency to that of allopregnanolone but was previously thought not to be produced in rats.

Modification of Multiple Sclerosis Phenotypes by African Ancestry at HLA	ARCHIVES OF NEUROLOGY			English	Article							NURSING-HOME RESIDENTS; NEUROMYELITIS-OPTICA; DIAGNOSTIC-CRITERIA; CLINICAL-COURSE; HLA-DRB1 LOCUS; RISK; SUSCEPTIBILITY; DISABILITY; SEX; AMERICANS	Background: In those with multiple sclerosis ( MS), African American individuals have a more severe disease course, an older age at onset, and more often have clinical manifestations restricted to the optic nerves and spinal cord (opticospinal MS) than white persons. Objective: To determine whether genetic variation influences clinical MS patterns. Design: Retrospective multicenter cohort study. Participants: Six hundred seventy-three African American and 717 white patients with MS. Main Outcome Measures: Patients with MS were genotyped for HLA-DRB1 and HLA-DQB1 alleles. The proportion of European ancestry at HLA was estimated by genotyping single-nucleotide polymorphisms with known significant frequency differences in West African and European populations. These genotypes were correlated with the opticospinal disease phenotype, disability measures, and age at onset. Results: Subjects with DRB1*15 alleles were twice as likely to have typical MS rather than opticospinal MS (P=.001). Of the subjects with opticospinal MS or a history of recurrent transverse myelitis who were seropositive for anti-aquaporin 4 antibodies (approximately 5%), none carried DRB1*15 alleles (P=. 008). Independently of DRB1*15, African ancestry at HLA correlated with disability as measured by the Multiple Sclerosis Severity Score (P<.001) and risk of cane dependency (hazard ratio, 1.36; P<.001); DRB1*15 alleles were associated with a 2.1-year earlier age at onset (P<.001). Conclusions: These data indicate that the role of HLA in MS is not limited to disease susceptibility but that genes embedded in this locus also influence clinical outcomes.	[Cree, Bruce A.

Netrin-1 is a bi-functional cue that attracts or repels different classes of neurons during development. The netrin-1 receptor DCC (deleted in colorectal cancer) acts as a tyrosine kinase-associated receptor to mediate the attractive response towards netrin-1. The lipid raft-localized Src family kinase Fyn is required for DCC-mediated axon guidance. DCC functions are also dependent on lipid rafts, membrane microdomains corresponding to a low-density, detergent-resistant membrane fraction. However, it remains unclear how the association of DCC with lipid rafts controls netrin-1 signalling. Results. DCC targeted to lipid rafts represented a minor proportion of total DCC inside the cell, but predominated on the cell surface of both IMR-32 human neuroblastoma cells and embryonic cortical neurons. Netrin-1 accumulated in lipid rafts, but had no effect on the targeting of DCC to that compartment, with DCC remaining on the cell surface in lipid rafts through 60 min post-treatment. However, DCC was able to interact with Fyn, both in the lipid rafts and soluble compartments isolated from embryonic El 9 rat brains, whereas early downstream signalling components such as Nck-1, and total and active focal adhesion kinase were mainly localized to the non-lipid raft compartment. Conclusions. Together, these results suggest that DCC can be found in raft and non-raft portions of the plasma membrane, with early signalling events propagated by non-raft associated DCC.

Accurate risk estimates are also required for clinical trial design, to ensure homogeneous patient distribution. Nomograms, risk groupings, artificial neural networks (ANNs), probability tables, and classification and regression tree (CART) analyses represent the available decision aids that can be used within these tasks. We critically reviewed available decision aids (nomograms, risk groupings, ANNs, probability tables and CART analyses) and compared their ability to predict the outcome of interest. Of the available decision aids, nomograms provide individualized evidence-based and highly accurate risk estimates that facilitate management-related decisions. We suggest the use of nomograms for the purpose of evidence-based, individualized decision-making.

Thirty-six French-speaking young adults performed both semantic and phonological word judgment tasks, using a divided visual field procedure. The phonological complexity of words was controlled by varying their transparency, while semantic complexity was manipulated through prototypicality. As expected, processing complexity modulated semantic and phonological processing differently. The results revealed that an increase in processing complexity lessened the left-hemisphere advantage in semantics, but reinforced it in phonology. It is therefore suggested that right-hemisphere collaboration in complex language processing is profitable only when the particular kind of processing is not strongly lateralized to the left-hemi sphere. The results are discussed from the perspective of interhemispheric collaboration. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Barbeau, EB; Mendrek, A; Mottron, L				Barbeau, Elise B.; Mendrek, Adrianna; Mottron, Laurent			Are autistic traits autistic?	BRITISH JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY			English	Editorial Material							CONGENITAL ADRENAL-HYPERPLASIA; MALE BRAIN THEORY; SYSTEMATIZING QUOTIENT; TESTOSTERONE; 2ND; INDIVIDUALS; EMPATHY; RATIO	According to the extreme male brain theory of autism (Baron-Cohen, 2002), autistic traits would be extreme manifestations of typical male behaviours. The Auyeung et al. (2009) paper establishes a link between autistic traits and higher fetal testosterone (fT) levels in typically developing children. We argue that the construct behind this relationship needs further investigation. First, the link between fT levels and sexually dimorphic traits, that are for example, associated with empathizing and systemizing, is controversial. Likewise, describing autistic behaviours as being extreme male-like is debatable. The cerebral hemisphere laterality pattern of individuals with autism also seems to differ from the pattern typically observed in males. Moreover, the parallel that should exist, according to the fT theory, between individuals with autism and individuals with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), because of their high fT levels, is unclear. The theory implying fT levels in autism fails to account for a big part of autism, and the link between fT and normal 'autistic traits' hardly demonstrates the causal link between fT and autism.

Based on feedback obtained through a national program of heart failure workshops and through active solicitation of stakeholders, several topics were identified because of their importance to the practicing clinician. Topics chosen for the present update include best practices for the diagnosis and management of right-sided heart failure, myocarditis and device therapy, and a review of recent important or landmark clinical trials These recommendations were developed using the structured approach for the review and assessment of evidence adopted and previously described by the Society. The present update has been written from a clinical perspective to provide a user-friendly and practical approach. Specific clinical questions that are addressed include: What is right-sided heart failure and how should one approach the diagnostic work-tip? What other clinical entities may masquerade as this nebulous condition and how can we tell them apart? When should we be concerned about the presence of myocarditis and how quickly should patients with this condition be referred to an experienced centre? Among the myriad of recently published landmark clinical trials, which ones will impact our standards of clinical care? The goals are to aid physicians and other health care providers to optimally treat heart failure patients, resulting in a measurable impact on patient health and clinical outcomes in Canada.

Accepted indications include bridging to transplantation or recovery. The present study reviewed the results following MCSS implantation at the Montreal Heart Institute (Montreal, Quebec). METHODS: From September 1987 to September 2006, 43 MCSS were implanted (32 Thoratec [Thoratec Corporation, USA], nine CirdioWest TAH [SynCardia Systems Inc, USA], two Novacor [WorldHeart Corporation, Canada]) in 43 patients (mean [+/- SD] age 44 +/- 13 years; range 19 to 64 years). Indications for implantation included cardiogenic shock due to ischemic (n=19), vital (n=10) or other types of cardiomyopathics (n=14). RESULTS: The mean ejection fraction before implantation was 17.6 +/- 6.59% (range 10% to 45%). Before MCSS implantation, most patients showed signs of end-organ failure, including mechanical ventilation (77%), central venous pressure higher than 16 mmHg (44%), oliguria (35%) and hepatic dysfunction (19%). The mean duration of MCSS support was 22.8 +/- 32.8 days (range one to 158 days). Survival to transplantation or recovery was 74%. Only one patient was successfully bridged to recovery. Complications were common during MC Support. They included re-exploration for bleeding (47%), respiratory failure (44%) renal failure requiring temporary dialysis (40%), infection (33%) and neurological events (16%). Only one patient had device failure. In patients successfully bridged to transplantation, early actuarial survival (one month) following transplantation averaged 71 +/- 890 and was 57 +/- 9% at one year. CONCLUSION: MCSS support with a left ventricular assist device or a total artificial heart provides an effective means of bridging terminally ill patients to transplantation or recovery. Early survival after transplantation shows satisfactory results. However, these results come at the expense of frequent device-related complications, and device failure remains a constant threat.

Identifying patients at risk remains difficult and no consensus has been reached regarding the best approach for follow-up and prevention of sudden death.OBJECTIVES: To identify noninvasive clinical and electrocardiographic predictors of adverse cardiac events in patients with DM1.METHODS: Clinical and serial electrocardiographic data on 428 patients with a DNA-proven diagnosis of DM1, followed during a mean period of 11.7 years, were reviewed. Variables associated with adverse cardiac events were identified.RESULTS: Eleven patients (2.6 %) experienced sudden death and 13 (3.0 %) required implantation of a pacemaker. On univariate analysis, adverse events were associated with advancing age, prolongation of the PR, QRS and corrected QT (QTc) intervals, as well as the degree of neuromuscular impairment. No such relationship was found with the extent of genetic anomaly (number of cytosine-thymine-guanine repeats). However, multivariate analysis using Cox proportional hazards models showed that only baseline PR and QTc intervals were significantly linked to the end points of sudden death or pacemaker implantation; the age-adjusted RR was 3.7 (95 % CI 1.5 to 8.6) if baseline PR was 200 ms or longer (P=0.003), and 3.0 (95 % CI 1.0 to 8.8) if the baseline QTc was 450 ms or longer (P=0.047).CONCLUSIONS: In a large unselected cohort of 428 patients with DM1, the cumulative incidence of sudden death was relatively low, and the delayed conduction on surface electrocardiogram was found to be potentially helpful for identifying patients at risk for sudden death or pacemaker implantation.

Using GA-ANN algorithm to optimize soft magnetic properties of nanocrystalline mechanically alloyed Fe-Si powders	COMPUTATIONAL MATERIALS SCIENCE			English	Article						Fe-Si powders; Artificial neural network; Genetic algorithm; Coercivity; Nanocrystalline	NEURAL-NETWORK; PREDICTION; PARAMETERS	In this investigation a theoretical model based on artificial neural network (ANN) and genetic algorithm (CA) has been developed to optimize the magnetic softness in nanocrystalline Fe-Si powders prepared by mechanical alloying (MA). The ANN model was used to correlate the milling time, chemical composition, milling speed, and ball to powders ratio (BPR) to coercivity and crystallite size of nanocrystalline Fe-Si powders. The GA-ANN combined algorithm was incorporated to find the optimal conditions for achieving the minimum coercivity. By comparing the predicted values with the experimental data it is demonstrated that the combined CA-ANN algorithm is a useful, efficient and strong method to find the optimal milling conditions and chemical composition for producing nanocrystalline Fe-Si powders with minimum coercivity.

The first model is based on deterministic electricity prices while the other integrates price stochasticity through the management of a tree of potential price scenarios. Numerical results based on historical data demonstrate the superiority of the stochastic model over the deterministic one. It is also shown that price volatility impacts the profits obtained by the stochastic model. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Netrin 1 and Dcc regulate oligodendrocyte process branching and membrane extension via Fyn and RhoA	DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Oligodendroglia; Myelination; Myelin; Netrin; Integrin; Laminin; Autocrine; Mouse; Rat; FAK (Ptk2); N-WASP (Wasl)	FOCAL ADHESION KINASE; SRC FAMILY KINASES; SPINAL-CORD; CNS MYELINATION; TYROSINE KINASE; PREMYELINATING OLIGODENDROCYTES; CELL ADHESION; N-WASP; INTEGRINS; PHOSPHORYLATION	The molecular mechanisms underlying the elaboration of branched processes during the later stages of oligodendrocyte maturation are not well understood. Here we describe a novel role for the chemotropic guidance cue netrin 1 and its receptor deleted in colorectal carcinoma (Dcc) in the remodeling of oligodendrocyte processes. Postmigratory, premyelinating oligodendrocytes express Dcc but not netrin 1, whereas mature myelinating oligodendrocytes express both. We demonstrate that netrin 1 promotes process extension by premyelinating oligodendrocytes in vitro and in vivo. Addition of netrin 1 to mature oligodendrocytes in vitro evoked a Dcc-dependent increase in process branching. Furthermore, expression of netrin 1 and Dcc by mature oligodendrocytes was required for the elaboration of myelin-like membrane sheets. Maturation of oligodendrocyte processes requires intracellular signaling mechanisms involving Fyn, focal adhesion kinase (FAK), neuronal Wiscott-Aldrich syndrome protein (N-WASP) and RhoA; however, the extracellular cues upstream of these proteins in oligodendrocytes are poorly defined. We identify a requirement for Src family kinase activity downstream of netrin-1-dependent process extension and branching. Using oligodendrocytes derived from Fyn knockout mice, we demonstrate that Fyn is essential for netrin-1-induced increases in process branching. Netrin 1 binding to Dcc on mature oligodendrocytes recruits Fyn to a complex with the Dcc intracellular domain that includes FAK and N- WASP, resulting in the inhibition of RhoA and inducing process remodeling. These findings support a novel role for netrin 1 in promoting oligodendrocyte process branching and myelin-like membrane sheet formation. These essential steps in oligodendroglial maturation facilitate the detection of target axons, a key step towards myelination.	[Rajasekharan, Sathyanath; Baker, K.

From birth, the visual system of the newborn rat will gradually mature, the first manifestation of that being the opening of the eye which usually take place at postnatal day 14. Complete maturation of the retina and visual pathways is normally reached at the end of the first month of life. The neonatal rat model thus represents a unique paradigm to study the normal and abnormal maturation of the primary visual pathways that normally occurs in utero in human subjects. Our laboratory has, over the past decade, developed two animal models of postnatally induced retinopathy, namely the Oxygen-Induced Retinopathy (OIR) that share several common features with the human Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP) and the Light-Induced Retinopathy that is viewed by some as a valid model of some forms of Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP). The following pages review what is known of the pathophysiological processes taking place and suggest possible therapeutic avenues that could be explored in order to halt the degenerative process.

We carried out a retrospective review to better characterize the frequency of those abnormalities in IS and in children and adults treated with vigabatrin for refractory complex partial seizures (CPS). Medical records and 332 cranial MRIs from 205 infants (aged <= 24 months) with IS treated at 10 sites in the United States and Canada were collected. Similarly, 2,074 images from 668 children (aged 2-16 years) and adults (aged > 16 years) with CPS were re-reviewed. Prespecified MRI abnormalities were defined as any hyperintensity on T(2)-weighted or fluid-attenuated inversion-recovery (FLAIR) sequences with or without diffusion restriction not readily explained by a radiographically well-characterized pathology. MRIs were read by two neuroradiologists blinded to treatment group. The incidence and prevalence of MRI abnormalities associated with vigabatrin were estimated. Among infants with IS, the prevalence of prespecified MRI abnormalities was significantly higher among vigabatrin-treated versus vigabatrin-naive subjects (22% vs. 4%; p < 0.001). Of nine subjects in the prevalence population with at least one subsequent determinate MRI, resolution of MRI abnormalities occurred in six (66.7%)-vigabatrin was discontinued in four. Among adults and children treated with vigabatrin for CPS, there was no statistically significant difference in the incidence or prevalence of prespecified MRI abnormalities between vigabatrin-exposed and vigabatrin-naive subjects. Vigabatrin is associated with transient, asymptomatic MRI abnormalities in infants treated for IS. The majority of these MRI abnormalities resolved, even in subjects who remained on vigabatrin therapy.

For these purposes, recording sessions were conducted on rats of different age groups (P15-18; P21-24; P27-29 and P60-80). Results show that SC auditory neurons' RFs go through multiple changes during early development before the establishment of the adult-like auditory topographic map (P27). These modifications include, first, the refining of directional RFs tuning between P18 and P27 and, second, a shift of sensitivity towards 90 degrees in the contralateral hemispace after P15-18. In addition, data indicate that the neuronal response latencies are shorter in the adult group than in the P15-18 or P21-24 groups. Finally, a diminution in spontaneous firing rate was observed between the P15-18 group and the P60-80 group. The results of the present study revealed that the neural organization representing auditory space in the deep layers of the SC of the rat is not innate, but rather emerges at about P27-29. Moreover, they bring new evidence supporting a two-step process involved in the development of the representation of auditory space. Hence, the development of the auditory space representation follows a logical temporal maturation sequence whereby the RF organization must be completed before a stable topographic map can be formed.

However, we have shown a six to 10-fold increase in the number of astrocytes labeled with glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and astrocytic basic fibroblast growth factor or FGF-2 (bFGF) in the cingulate cortex area 2 (Cg2) in postpartum rats, indicative of changes in connectivity in this area. In the present studies, we investigated the necessary and sufficient stimuli for these changes to occur. We show that 3 h of maternal experience combined with a hormonal treatment that mimics late pregnancy induces the astrocytic changes in Cg2 in virgin rats. The extent of these changes was similar to those of postpartum females. Sensitized virgin females did not show any astrocytic changes after 3 h of maternal behavior, suggesting that a similar amount of maternal experience alone is not sufficient to increase astrocytic bFGF- and GFAP-immunoreactivity in Cg2. Consistent with these data, eliminating early maternal experience by removing pups immediately postpartum abolishes the increased bFGF and GFAP protein expression in the cingulate cortex. These results suggest that maternal experience and hormonal state interact to produce astrocytic remodeling in the Cg2. The current results are consistent with a role for the cingulate cortex in maternal responsivity as suggested by early lesion studies in rats and more recent imaging studies in humans.

Romantic love is thought to help intimate partners stay committed to each other and two mechanisms have been proposed to mediate this commitment: increased attention towards one's partner or deflected attention away from other potential partners. Both mechanisms find support in the literature. We explored the potential influence of each of these mechanisms by assessing women's ability to identify (ID) body odors originating from their boyfriend, a same-sex friend, and an opposite-sex friend and the relationship between this ability and the degree of romantic love expressed towards their boyfriend. We hypothesized that an increase in attention towards one's partner would render a positive correlation between ID of a boyfriend's body odor and degree of romantic love; conversely, we hypothesized that attention deflected away from other potential partners would render a negative correlation between ID of an opposite-sex friend's body odor and degree of romantic love for the boyfriend. Our results supported the deflection theory as we found a negative correlation between the degree of romantic love for the subjects' boyfriends and their ability to ID the body odor of an opposite-sex friend but not of their boyfriend or same-sex friend. Our results indicate that romantic love deflects attention away from potential new partners rather than towards the present partner. These changes are likely mediated by circulating neuropeptides and a testable model is suggested. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Functional magnetic resonance images (fMRI) were obtained from 19 children with ADHD and 20 healthy controls during resting state. Brain functional networks were constructed by thresholding the correlation matrix between 90 cortical and subcortical regions and further analyzed by applying graph theoretical approaches. Experimental results showed that, although brain networks of both groups exhibited economical small-world topology, altered functional networks were demonstrated in the brain of ADHD when compared with the normal controls. In particular, increased local efficiencies combined with a decreasing tendency in global efficiencies found in ADHD Suggested a disorder-related shift of the topology toward regular networks. Additionally, significant alterations in nodal efficiency were also found in ADHD, involving prefrontal, temporal, and occipital cortex regions, which were compatible with previous ADHD studies. The present study provided the first evidence for brain dysfunction in ADHD from the viewpoint of global organization of brain functional networks by using resting-state fMRI.

Furthermore, functional neuroimaging studies have demonstrated increased activity in the orbitofrontal cortex of the human brain during the encoding of novel visual and auditory information. The present positron emission tomography study examined brain activity related to the encoding of tactile information. Cerebral blood flow (CBF) in normal human subjects during the tactile exploration of novel stimuli from a related set of textures and patterns, as well as from a set of aversive tactile Stimuli, was compared with CBF during a control condition involving familiar tactile stimuli. The results demonstrate that the right rostral orbitofrontal cortex is involved in the active encoding of novel tactile information, while a more caudal region of the orbitofrontal cortex, which is more closely connected with limbic and autonomic regions of the brain, was activated when subjects explored novel aversive tactile stimuli. These results suggest that the orbitofrontal cortex, through its connections with the limbic areas of the medial temporal lobe, influences the processing of incoming information and thus contributes to its encoding.

A common variant in MTHFD1, p.Arg653Gln (c.1958G>A), may increase the I risk for neural tube defects (NTD). To examine the biological impact of this variant on MTHFD1 function, we measured enzyme activity and stability in vitro and assessed substrate flux in transfected mammalian cells. The purified Arg653Gln enzyme has normal substrate affinity but a 36% reduction in half-life at 42 degrees C. Thermolability is reduced by magnesium adenosine triphosphate and eliminated by the substrate analog folate pentaglutamate, suggesting that folate status may modulate impact of the variant. The mutation reduces the metabolic activity Of MTHFD1 within cells: formate incorporation into DNA in murine Mthfd1 knockout cells transfected with Arg653Gln is reduced by 26% +/- 7.7% (P < 0.05), compared to cells transfected with wild-type protein, indicating a disruption of de novo purine synthesis. We assessed the impact of the variant on risk for congenital heart defects (C in a cohort of Quebec children (158 cases, 110 controls) and mothers of children with heart defects (199 cases, 105 controls). The 653QQ genotype in children is associated with increased risk for heart defects (odds ratio [OR], 2.11; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.01-4.42), particularly Tetralogy of Fallot (OR, 3.60; 95% CI, 1.38-9.42) and aortic stenosis (OR, 3.13; 95% CI, 1.13-8.66). There was no effect of maternal genotype. Our results indicate that the Arg653Gln polymorphism decreases enzyme stability and increases risk for CHD. Further evaluation of this polymorphism in folate-related disorders and its potential interaction with folate status is warranted.

Maternal cigarette smoking during pregnancy and cognitive performance in adolescence	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						Tobacco; pregnancy; adolescence; cognition; sex; neuropsychological assessment	CHILDHOOD PHYSICAL AGGRESSION; SEX-DIFFERENCES; PRENATAL EXPOSURE; PUBERTAL CHANGES; FRONTAL-LOBE; FOLLOW-UP; AGE; CHILDREN; PATTERN; MEMORY	Background The incidence of cigarette smoking during pregnancy remains high. Maternal smoking during pregnancy is known to be associated with cognitive and behavioural sequelae in childhood and adolescence. We assessed the relationship between maternal cigarette smoking during pregnancy and cognitive abilities in adolescent offspring (n = 503, 12- to 18-years old) using an extensive 6-h battery of tests. Methods Non-exposed adolescents (controls) were matched to exposed adolescents (cases) by maternal education and school attended. Cognitive abilities were evaluated using a neuropsychological battery consisting of 33 tasks measuring verbal abilities, visuo-spatial skills, verbal and visual memory, processing speed, resistance to interference and motor dexterity. Results We found no differences between cases and controls in any of the cognitive domains whether potential confounders were included in the model or not. In addition to maternal smoking during pregnancy, we also evaluated the effect of sex and age on the various cognitive abilities in this large adolescent sample and found that most of the abilities continue to improve during adolescence to the same extent in girls and boys, with several age-independent sex differences. Conclusions We found no effect of maternal cigarette smoking during pregnancy on cognitive abilities of the adolescent offspring when matching cases and controls by maternal education, the most common confounder of maternal cigarette smoking during pregnancy.

This paper is a report of a study to compare the importance and usefulness ratings of physiological and behavioural indicators of pain in neonates at risk for neurological impairment by nurse clinicians and pain researchers. Neonates at risk for neurological impairment have not been systematically included in neonatal pain measure development and how clinicians and researchers view pain indicators in these infants is unknown. Data triangulation was undertaken in three Canadian Neonatal Intensive Care Units using data from: (a) 149 neonates at high, moderate and low risk for neurological impairment, (b) 95 nurse clinicians from the three units where infant data were collected and (c) 14 international pain researchers. Thirteen indicators were assessed following heel lance in neonates and 39 indicators generated from nurse clinicians and pain researchers were assessed for importance and accuracy. Data were collected between 2004 and 2005. Across risk groups, indicators with the highest accuracy for discriminating 'pain' among neonates were: brow bulge (77-83%), eye squeeze (75-84%), nasolabial furrow (79-81%), and total facial expression (78-83%). Correlations between nurse ratings and neonatal accuracy scores ranged from moderate to none (mild risk r = 0.52, P = 0.07; moderate r = 0.43, P = 0.15; high r = -0.12, P = 0.69). Researchers demonstrated a better understanding of the importance of pain indicators (mild risk, r = 0.91, P < 0.001; moderate 0.85, P < 0.001; 0.0002; high r = 0.64, P = 0.019) than nurse clinicians. Facial actions were rated as the most important indicators of neonatal pain. However, as neurological impairment risk increased, physiological indicators were rated more important by nurse clinicians and pain researchers, opposite to pain indicators demonstrated by neonates.

A PEX10 defect in a patient with no detectable defect in peroxisome assembly or metabolism in cultured fibroblasts	JOURNAL OF INHERITED METABOLIC DISEASE			English	Article							ZELLWEGER-SYNDROME; BIOGENESIS DISORDERS; TRIHYDROXYCHOLESTANOIC-ACID; DIAGNOSIS; PHENOTYPE; DISEASE; ADRENOLEUKODYSTROPHY; IDENTIFICATION; LIVER	Zellweger spectrum disorders (ZSD) are diagnosed by biochemical assay in blood, urine and cultured fibroblasts and PEX gene mutation identification. In most cases studies in fibroblasts corroborate results obtained in body fluids. In 1996 Clayton and colleagues described a 10-year old girl with evidence of a peroxisome disorder, based on elevated bile acid metabolites and phytanate. At the time it was not possible to distinguish whether she had a ZSD or a single peroxisomal protein defect. Studies in our laboratory showed that she also had elevated plasma pipecolate, supporting the former diagnosis. Despite the abnormal metabolites detected in blood (phytanate, bile acid intermediates and pipecolate), analysis of multiple peroxisomal pathways in fibroblasts yielded normal results. In addition, she had a milder clinical phenotype than usually associated with ZSD. Since complementation analysis to determine the gene defect was not possible, we screened this patient following the PEX Gene Screen algorithm (PGS). The PGS provides a template for sequencing PEX gene exons independent of complementation analysis. Two mutations in PEX10 were identified, a frameshift mutation inherited from her father and a de novo missense mutation in a conserved functional domain on the other allele. This case highlights that molecular analysis may be essential to the diagnosis of patients at the milder end of the ZSD spectrum. Furthermore, it supports the concept that some tissues are less affected by certain PEX gene defects than brain and liver.	[Steinberg, S. J.; Snowden, A.; Watkins, P. A.; Raymond, G. V.; Moser, A.

Regression of language and non-language skills in pervasive developmental disorders	JOURNAL OF INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY RESEARCH			English	Article						ADI-R; language; PDD; regression; thimerosal; vaccine	AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDERS; HEAD CIRCUMFERENCE; MEASLES-VIRUS; CHILDREN; PHENOTYPE; BRAIN; MUMPS; ASSOCIATION; HISTORY; VACCINE	Background As part of the pervasive developmental disorders (PDD), there is a subgroup of individuals reported to have a different onset of symptom appearance consisting of an apparently normal early development, followed by a loss of verbal and/or non-verbal skills prior to 2 years of age. This study aims at comparing the symptomatology of children who displayed a regression and often an associated intellectual disability through investigation of two types of loss, namely language and other skill regression. Methods This study examined the occurrence of regression in 135 children with PDD, mean age 6.3 years. The sample was composed of 80 (59.4%) children diagnosed with autism, 44 (32.6%) with pervasive developmental disorder-not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS) and 11 (8%) with Asperger syndrome. The Autism Diagnostic Interview Revised (ADI-R) was used to evaluate the type of loss and to characterise associated factors including birth rank, gender and thimerosal exposure through vaccination. Results A total of 30 (22%) subjects regressed: nine (30%) underwent language regression alone, 17 (57%) lost a skill other than language and four (13%) lost both language and another skill. Significantly higher levels of regression were found in autism (30%) compared with PDD-NOS (14%) and Asperger syndrome (0%). Children who regressed in language skills spoke at a significantly earlier age ((X) over bar = 12 months) than those who did not regress in this domain ((X) over bar = 26 months). Parents and interviewers consistently reported developmental abnormalities prior to the loss. ADI-R domain mean scores indicated a more severe autistic symptomatology profile in children who regressed compared with those who did not, especially in the repetitive behaviour domain. Regression was not associated to thimerosal exposure, indirectly estimated by year of birth. Conclusions A loss of skill, present in one out of five children with PDD, is associated with a slightly more severe symptomatology as measured by the ADI-R, particularly in the repetitive behaviours domain. Furthermore, although abnormalities are often noticed by the caregivers at the time of regression, the ADI-R reveals that other atypical behaviours were in fact present prior to the onset of regression in most cases. None of the secondary factors investigated were associated with regression. In children unexposed to thimerosal-containing vaccines, the rate of regression was similar to that reported in studies of samples exposed to thimerosal, suggesting that thimerosal has no specific association with regressive autism.

A comparative neuropsychological test battery differentiates cognitive signatures of Fragile X and Down syndrome	JOURNAL OF INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY RESEARCH			English	Article						delayed-non-matching-to-sample task; Down syndrome; Fragile X syndrome; object discrimination; reversal learning; visual-spatial abilities	SHORT-TERM-MEMORY; EXECUTIVE FUNCTION; WORKING-MEMORY; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; PREFRONTAL LESIONS; LEARNING-DEFICITS; WILLIAMS-SYNDROME; FMR1 GENE; CHILDREN	Standardised neuropsychological and cognitive measures present some limitations in their applicability and generalisability to individuals with intellectual disability (ID). Alternative approaches to defining the cognitive signatures of various forms of ID are needed to advance our understanding of the profiles of strengths and weaknesses as well as the affected brain areas. To evaluate the utility and feasibility of six non-verbal comparative neuropsychological (CN) tasks administered in a modified version of the Wisconsin General Test Apparatus (WGTA) to confirm and extend our knowledge of unique cognitive signatures of Fragile X syndrome (FXS) and Down syndrome (DS). A test battery of CN tasks adapted from the animal literature was administered in a modified WGTA. Tasks were selected that have established or emerging brain-behaviour relationships in the domains of visual-perceptual, visual-spatial, working memory and inhibition. Despite the fact that these tasks revealed cognitive signatures for the two ID groups, only some hypotheses were supported. Results suggest that whereas individuals with DS were relatively impaired on visual-perceptual and visual-spatial reversal learning tasks they showed strengths in egocentric spatial learning and object discrimination tasks. Individuals with FXS were relatively impaired on object discrimination learning and reversal tasks, which was attributable to side preferences. In contrast, these same individuals exhibited strengths in egocentric spatial learning and reversal tasks as well as on an object recognition memory task. Both ID groups demonstrated relatively poor performance for a visual-spatial working memory task. Performance on the modified WGTA tasks differentiated cognitive signatures between two of the most common forms of ID. Results are discussed in the context of the literature on the cognitive and neurobiological features of FXS and DS.	[Kogan, C.

Materials and Methods: This multicenter study of normal brain and behavior development provides both longitudinal and cross-sectional data, and has enabled us to investigate T2 evolution in several brain regions in healthy children within the age range of birth through 4 years 5 months. Due to the multicenter nature of the study and the extended period of data collection, periodically scanned inanimate and human phantoms were used to assess intra- and intersite variability. Results: The main finding of this work. based on over 340 scans, is the identification and parameterization of the monoexponential evolution of T2 from birth through 4 years 5 months of age in various brain structures. Conclusion: The exponentially decaying T2 behavior is believed to reflect the rapid changes in water content as well as myelination during brain development. The data will become publicly available as part of a normative pediatric MRI and clinical/behavioral database, thereby providing a basis for comparison in studies assessing normal brain development, and studies of deviations due to various neurological, neuropsychiatric, and developmental disorders.

J	Golden, RL				Golden, Richard L.			Gertrude Stein (1874-1946) and the nucleus of Darkschewitsch: a discursive commentary	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL BIOGRAPHY			English	Article								Gertrude Stein is an icon of American literature whose scientific and medical background has become shrouded in obscurity. As an undergraduate at Radcliffe she was strongly influenced by William James and published two papers on motor automatism in the Psychological Review. As a medical student at Johns Hopkins University, her research on the nucleus of Darkschewitsch was quoted in Lewellys. F Barker's acclaimed textbook on neuroanatomy; Stein's first book appearance. The background of the Russian neurologist Liverji O Darkschewitsch, little known in the West, is explored particularly in regard to his relationship and collaboration with Sigmund Freud whose letters provide considerable insight. Gertrude Stein failed to graduate with her class of 1901 at Johns Hopkins and soon after departed for an expatriate life in Europe devoted to art and literature.

Contribution of TARDBP mutations to sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL GENETICS			English	Article							FRONTOTEMPORAL LOBAR DEGENERATION; MOTOR-NEURON DISEASE; TDP-43; GENE; INCLUSIONS; PROTEINS	Aims and background: Mutations in the TARDBP gene, which encodes the TAR DNA binding protein (TDP-43), have been described in individuals with familial and sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We screened the TARDBP gene in 285 French sporadic ALS patients to assess the frequency of TARDBP mutations in ALS. Results: Six individuals had potentially deleterious mutations of which three were novel including a Y374X truncating mutation and P363A and A382P missense mutations. This suggests that TARDBP mutations may predispose to ALS in approximately 2% of the individuals followed in this study. Conclusion: Our findings, combined with those from other collections, brings the total number of mutations in unrelated ALS patients to 17, further suggesting that mutations in the TARDBP gene have an important role in the pathogenesis of ALS.

Helix 3 is necessary and sufficient for prion protein's anti-Bax function	JOURNAL OF NEUROCHEMISTRY			English	Article						B-cell lymphoma 2 associated protein X; helix 3; MCF-7 cells; neuron; prion protein; structure-function	MEDIATED CELL-DEATH; BREAST-CARCINOMA; THERMODYNAMIC STABILITY; CEREBELLAR DEGENERATION; COPPER-BINDING; DEFICIENT MICE; HUMAN NEURONS; ALPHA-HELIX; DISEASE; BCL-2	To identify the structural elements of the prion protein (PrP) necessary for its protective function against Bcl-2 associated protein X (Bax), we performed structure-function analyses of the anti-Bax function of cytosolic PrP (CyPrP) in MCF-7 cells. Deletions of 1, 2, or 3 N-terminal Bcl-2 homology domain 2-like octapeptide repeats (BORs), but not deletion of all four BORs, abolish CyPrPs anti-Bax function. Deletion of alpha-helix 3 (PrP23-199) or further C-terminal deletions of alpha-helix 1 and 2, and beta-strand 1 and 2 (PrP23-172, PrP23-160, PrP23-143, and PrP23-127) eliminates CyPrPs protection against Bax-mediated cell death. The substitution of helix 3 amino acid residues K204, V210, and E219 by proline inhibits the anti-Bax function of CyPrP. The substitution of K204, but not V210 and E219, by alanine residues also prevents CyPrPs anti-Bax function. Expression of PrPs helix 3 displays anti-Bax activity in MCF-7 cells and in human neurons. Together, these results indicate that although the BOR domain has an influence on PrPs anti-Bax function, the helix 3 is necessary and sufficient for the anti-Bax function of CyPrP. Identification of helix 3 as the structural element for the anti-Bax function thus provides a molecular target to modulate PrPs anti-Bax function in cancer and neurodegeneration.

The peripheral vestibular organs have long been known to receive a bilateral efferent innervation from the brain stem. However, the functional role of the efferent vestibular system has remained elusive. In this study, we investigated efferent-mediated responses in vestibular afferents of alert behaving primates (macaque monkey). We found that efferent-mediated rotational responses could be obtained from vestibular nerve fibers innervating the semicircular canals after conventional afferent responses were nulled by placing the corresponding canal plane orthogonal to the plane of motion. Responses were type III, i.e., excitatory for rotational velocity trapezoids (peak velocity, 320 degrees/s) in both directions of rotation, consistent with those previously reported in the decerebrate chinchilla. Responses consisted of both fast and slow components and were larger in irregular (similar to 10 spikes/s) than in regular afferents (similar to 2 spikes/s). Following unilateral labyrinthectomy (UL) on the side opposite the recording site, similar responses were obtained. To confirm the vestibular source of the efferent-mediated responses, the ipsilateral horizontal and posterior canals were plugged following the UL. Responses to high-velocity rotations were drastically reduced when the superior canal (SC), the only intact canal, was in its null position, compared with when the SC was pitched 50 upward from the null position. Our findings show that vestibular afferents in alert primates show efferent-mediated responses that are related to the discharge regularity of the afferent, are of vestibular origin, and can be the result of both afferent excitation and inhibition.

The authors report long-term follow-Up seizure outcome in patients who underwent corpus callosotomy during the period 1981-2001 at the Montreal Neurological Institute. Methods. The records of 95 patients with a minimum follow-Lip of 5 years (mean 17.2 years) were retrospectively evaluated with respect to seizure, medication outcomes, and prognostic factors on seizure outcome. Results. All patients had more than one type of seizure, most frequently drop attacks and generalized tonic-clonic seizures. The most disabling seizure type was drop attacks, followed by generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Improvement was noted in several seizure types and was most likely for generalized tonic-clonic seizures (77.3%) and drop attacks (77.2%). Simple partial, generalized tonic. and myoclonic seizures also benefited from anterior callosotomy. The extent of the callosal section was correlated with favorable seizure outcome. The complications were mild and transient and no death was seen. Conclusions. This study confirms that anterior callosotomy is an effective treatment in intractable generalized seizures that are not amenable to focal resection. When considering this procedure, the treating physician must thoroughly assess the expected benefits, limitations, likelihood of residual seizures, and the risks, and explain them to the patient, his or her family, and other caregivers.

Ischemic cerebral vascular accidents (CVAs) in children result in epilepsy in 25% of patients. which is refractory in 7% of cases. Repeated seizures worsen the global and cognitive prognosis of these patients. To evaluate the prognosis of epilepsy and cognitive development in children with refractory seizures following a CVA, the authors retrospectively studied the effectiveness of periinsular hemispherotomy in the treatment of these patients. Methods. Between March 1995 and November 2007, 8 children who suffered from stroke-induced refractory epilepsy underwent a periinsular hemispherotomy. All patients' charts were reviewed in a retrospective manner. Age at the time of the CVA, imaging studies, cause of the ischemic event, onset of the first seizure, patient's handedness, the extent of the parenchymal damage, electroencephalography findings, type of epileptic seizures, number of Seizures per day, number of antiepileptic medications, preoperative neuropsychological evaluation, and surgical Outcome with regard to the patient's seizure activity were analyzed. Results. There were 7 boys and I girl in this study. The mean age at stroke was 23 months (range birth-5 years). The mean age years (range 54-130 months). The average delay prior to the hemispherotomy was 5 years and 3 months (range 23-115 months). Prior to surgery, the average number of seizures per day was 35 (range 5-100). The average number of antiepileptic medications introduced before the hemispherotomy was 8 (range 6-12). Six patients required only 1 surgical intervention and 2 necessitated 2 separate operations: 1 underwent a 2-staged hemispherotomy and the other underwent a prior callosotomy. There were no reported surgical complications in this series. Seven children are seizure free. However, the remaining child, after a 3.5-year disease-free interval, has recently started having seizures. No child demonstrated an improvement in neuropsychological evaluation. Conclusions. periinsular hemispherotomy must be considered ail alternative in the therapeutic approach to stroke-induced pediatric refractory epilepsy. It is effective in controlling seizure activity. The authors believe the delay before hemispherotomy must be shortened in children with post-CVA refractory epilepsy.

Here we used transgenic approaches to examine the hypothesis that NF-kappa B is an important intrinsic factor of adult DRG neurons for their in vivo capacity to survive after nerve injury. We generated transgenic mice expressing the NF-kappa B super-inhibitor (I kappa B alpha-SI), a multi-mutant form of I kappa B alpha, specifically in adult neurons. Adult DRG neurons in these transgenic animals are not abnormally susceptible to apoptosis after peripheral nerve injury, although there is a significant inhibition in the ability of NF-kappa B to translocate into their nucleus. We investigated the observed lack of NF-kappa B neuroprotective function at the level of NF-kappa B transcriptional activity using transgenic NF-kappa B/LacZ reporter mice. We show that the expression of the NF-kappa B reporter transgene is restricted in naive and injured DRG neurons. However, NF-kappa B transcriptional activity in adult DRG neurons is evident upon exposure to Trichostatin A (TSA) which is a specific inhibitor of histone deacetylases. Taken together our results illustrate that the functions of NF-kappa B are limited in adult primary sensory neurons due to a transcriptional repression mechanism mediated by histone deacetylases, and that intrinsic neuroprotective factors other than NF-kappa B are responsible for the resistance of adult DRG neurons to apoptosis in response to nerve injury.

However, the mechanisms coordinating these diverse activity-regulated processes remain poorly characterized. Recently, it was reported that histone deacetylase 4 (HDAC4) can mediate denervation-induced myogenin and nicotinic acetylcholine receptor gene expression. Here, we report that HDAC4 is not only necessary for denervation-dependent induction of genes involved in synaptogenesis (nicotinic acetylcholine receptor and muscle-specific receptor tyrosine kinase) but also for denervation-dependent suppression of genes involved in glycolysis (muscle-specific enolase and phosphofructokinase). In addition, HDAC4 differentially regulates genes involved in muscle fiber type specification by inducing myosin heavy chain IIA and suppressing myosin heavy chain IIB. Consistent with these regulated gene profiles, HDAC4 is enriched in fast oxidative fibers of innervated tibialis anterior muscle and HDAC4 knockdown enhances glycolysis in cultured myotubes. HDAC4 mediates gene induction indirectly by suppressing the expression of Dach2 and MITR that function as myogenin gene corepressors. In contrast, HDAC4 is directly recruited to myocyte enhancer factor 2 sites within target promoters to mediate gene suppression. Finally, we discovered an HDAC4/myogenin positive feedback loop that coordinates gene induction and repression underlying muscle phenotypic changes after muscle denervation.

Olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) of the olfactory epithelium are located in the nasal cavity and project axons that synapse onto dendrites of second-order neurons in the olfactory bulb (OB) that in turn relay the information gathered to higher order regions of the brain. The connections formed are remarkably accurate such that axons of OSNs expressing the same olfactory receptor innervate specific glomeruli within the complex three-dimensional structure that represents the OB. The molecular determinants that control this complex process are beginning to be identified. In this review, we discuss the role of various families of axon guidance cues and of recently characterized families of adhesion molecules in the formation of stereotypic connections in the olfactory system of mice.

First, image quality of three commonly used protocols, FLASH, MP-RAGE and MDEFT, was evaluated in terms of SNR, CNR, image uniformity and point spread function. These image metrics were estimated from simulations, phantom imaging and human studies. We then performed a VBM study on nine subjects scanned twice using the three protocols to evaluate differences in grey matter (GM) density and scan-rescan variability between the protocols. These results reveal the relative bias and precision of the tissue classification obtained using the different protocols. MDEFT achieved the highest CNR between white and grey matter, and the lowest GM density variability of the three sequences. Each protocol is also characterized by a distinct regional bias in GM density due to the effect of transmission field inhomogeneity on image uniformity combined with spatially variant GM T(1) values and the sequence's T(1) contrast function. The required population sample size estimates to detect a difference in GM density in longitudinal VBM studies, i.e. based only on methodological variance, were lowest for MDEFT. Although MP-RAGE requires more subjects than FLASH, its higher cortical CNR improves the accuracy of the tissue classification results, particularly in the motor cortex. For cross-sectional VBM studies, the variance in morphology across the population is likely to be the primary source of variability in the power analysis. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

All completed an RTE protocol in which targets were presented on the midline or in an inter- or intrahemispheric manner. Stimuli of different nature (luminance, equiluminant colour, and global motion) were used separately in three experiments in order to investigate the contribution of subcortical versus cortical pathways. Despite the preservation of the splenium (the portion of the corpus callosum assumed to transfer visual information), partial splitbrain individuals showed an enhanced RTE pattern as compared to neurologically intact individuals. Total split-brain individuals showed a tendency toward larger RTEs with the luminance stimuli than with the colour and motion stimuli, whereas this was not the case for partial split-brain individuals, suggesting a contribution of the posterior portion of the corpus callosum in the RTE. It is therefore likely that both sensory and motor processes contribute to the enhanced RTE in split-brain individuals. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

We studied 16 patients with AD [mean age +/- standard deviation (SD) = 74.1 +/- 5.2 years, mini-mental score examination (MMSE) = 23.1 +/- 2.9] and 22 elderly controls (72.3 +/- 5.0 years, MMSE = 28.5 +/- 1.3). Three-dimensional T1-weighted MR images of each subject were automatically parcellated into regions of interest (ROIs). Based upon the characteristics of gray matter extracted from each ROI, we used an SVM algorithm to classify the subjects and statistical procedures based on bootstrap resampling to ensure the robustness of the results. We obtained 94.5% mean correct classification for AD and control subjects (mean specificity, 96.6%; mean sensitivity, 91.5%). Our method has the potential in distinguishing patients with AD from elderly controls and therefore may help in the early diagnosis of AD.

Forebrain cholinergic innervation was estimated in transgenic mice with the A246E mutation by measuring the activity of the non-specific catabolic enzyme, acetylcholinesterase (AChE). In the model, A beta(42) concentrations increase without neuritic plaques or cell degeneration. PS1/A246E transgenic mice had altered AChE activity in several regions also vulnerable in Alzheimer pathology. In particular, AChE activity was upregulated in major cholinergic cell nuclei (medial septum, vertical diagonal band, substantia inominata) and in cortical and thalamic regions (eye field, posterior parietal and visual cortices, posterior thalamic and lateral geniculate nuclei) responsible for selective attention and visuomotor coordination, as well as limbic structures (hippocampal formation and amygdala) with related regions (midline, periventricular, reticular thalamic nuclei, and lateral prefrontal, agranular insular cortices) involved in cognition, arousal, emotion, and plasticity. As the murine model caused no apparent learning defects, cholinergic network changes in forebrain seem to be an early event caused by soluble A beta peptides. PS1/A246E mice mimic to some extent pre-symptomatic Alzheimer's disease neuropathology, useful for studying early neurochemical changes often inaccessible in clinical studies.

Whole-Body Responses: Neural Control and Implications for Rehabilitation and Fall Prevention	NEUROSCIENTIST			English	Review						locomotion; interlimb coordination; perturbation; whole-body reactions; rehabilitation	TIBIALIS ANTERIOR MUSCLE; AGE-RELATED-CHANGES; SPINAL-CORD-INJURY; HUMAN ARM MUSCLES; LOW-BONE-MASS; CHRONIC STROKE; DYNAMIC STABILITY; BALANCE RECOVERY; HUMAN LOCOMOTION; HUMAN WALKING	Humans are one of the unique species that utilize bipedal gait to ambulate in our environment. Despite this fact, coordination of the arms with the legs and the rest of body is essential for many daily activities. As such, whole-body responses have emerged as the preferred strategy following perturbations to balance during both standing and walking. Complex neural circuitry may allow for this coordination through the use of propriospinal pathways linking lumbar and cervical pattern generators in the spinal cord, with supraspinal centers altering this control depending on the context of the situation. Based on these findings, we argue that whole-body reactions may be exploited for rehabilitation purposes. Preliminary results have indicated training programs designed to elicit whole-body responses are effective in reducing falls and improving functional mobility in older adults with and without neurological impairment.

Blood test for idiopathic scoliosis	ORTHOPADE			German	Article						Idiopathic scoliosis; Melatonin transduction; Lymphocytes; Cellular dielectric spectroscopy; Early screening test	MELATONIN SIGNALING DYSFUNCTION; YOUNG CHICKENS; C57BL/6J MICE; HUMAN MEL1A; PINEALECTOMY; RECEPTOR; PATHOGENESIS; ETIOLOGY; LOCALIZATION; SEGREGATION	Spinal deformities, and particularly scoliosis, are the most frequent forms of orthopedic deformities in children and adolescents. About 1-6% of the population has scoliosis. This disorder leads to severe spinal deformities and predominantly affects adolescent girls. Although the multifactorial origin of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is broadly recognized, the genetic causes of AIS are still largely unknown. Our previous studies suggested a generalized dysfunction of melatonin transduction (the hormone that is primarily produced in the brain and epiphysis). In the meantime we have demonstrated that such a defect of signal transduction is caused by chemical alterations, which inactivate the function of the inhibitory G protein-coupled melatonin receptors. This discovery has led to the development of the first blood test to detect children without symptoms who are at risk of developing scoliosis. Since a single function (cellular reaction to melatonin) is determined, the unique advantage of this test is that it can be performed without knowledge of mutations in defective genes that could provoke the onset of AIS.

This communication was designed to investigate the effect of AVP on acupuncture analgesia in the rat model. The results showed that intraventricular injection (icv) of AVP could enhance acupuncture analgesia in a dose-dependent manner, whereas icv of anti-AVP serum decreased acupuncture analgesia. However, neither intrathecal (ith) nor intravenous injection (iv) of AVP or anti-AVP serum could influence acupuncture analgesia. Electrical acupuncture of "Zusanli" points (St. 36) decreased AVP concentration in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN), and increased AVP concentration in the hypothalamic supraoptic nucleus (SON), periaqueductial gray (PAG), caudate nucleus (CdN) and raphe magnus nucleus (RMN), but did not change AVP concentration in the pituitary, spinal cord and plasma. The effect of AVP on acupuncture analgesia was partly reversed by pretreatment with naloxone, an opiate receptor antagonist. These data suggested that AVP in the brain played a role in the process of acupuncture analgesia in combination with the endogenous opiate peptide system. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

CDF Collaboration	Measurement of the fraction of t(t)over-bar production via gluon-gluon fusion in p(p)over-bar collisions at root s=1.96 Tev	PHYSICAL REVIEW D			English	Article							QUARK PAIR PRODUCTION; SPIN CORRELATIONS; COLLIDERS	We present a measurement of the ratio of the t (t) over bar production cross section via gluon-gluon fusion to the total t (t) over bar production cross section in p (p) over bar collisions at root s = 1.96 Tev at the Tevatron. Using a data sample with an integrated luminosity of 955 pb(-1) recorded by the CDF II detector at Fermilab, we select events based on the t (t) over bar decay to lepton + jets. Using an artificial neural network technique we discriminate between t (t) over bar events produced via q (q) over bar annihilation and gg fusion, and find G(f) = sigma(gg -> t (t) over bar/sigma(p (p) over bar -> t (t) over bar) < 0.33 at the 68% confidence level. This result is combined with a previous measurement to obtain the most stringent measurement of this quantity by CDF to date, G(f) = 0.07(-0.07)(+0.15).	[Chen, Y.

J	Rolland, Y; Demeule, M; Fenart, L; Beliveau, R				Rolland, Yanneve; Demeule, Michel; Fenart, Laurence; Beliveau, Richard			Inhibition of melanoma brain metastasis by targeting melanotransferrin at the cell surface	PIGMENT CELL & MELANOMA RESEARCH			English	Article						Melanoma; Metastasis; melanotransferrin; blood-brain barrier; plasminogen	RECEPTOR-RELATED PROTEIN; PLASMINOGEN ACTIVATION SYSTEM; SOLUBLE MELANOTRANSFERRIN; ENDOTHELIAL-CELLS; TUMOR-GROWTH; ANTIGEN P97; IN-VIVO; BARRIER; TISSUE; EXPRESSION	Brain metastases are a common feature of malignant melanoma and are associated with poor prognosis. Melanotransferrin (MTf), one of several antigens associated with the surface of melanoma cells, has been demonstrated to promote cell invasion. In this study, we investigated the role of membrane-bound MTf in several of the steps leading to the development of melanoma brain metastasis. Our results indicated that MTf-positive cells were detected in the brains of nude mice injected intravenously with human melanoma SK-Mel 28 cells. Moreover, administration of a single dose of a monoclonal antibody (L235) directed against human MTf significantly reduced the development of human melanoma brain metastases in nude mice. The ability of melanoma cells to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in vitro is correlated with their MTf expression levels at the cell surface. Overall, our results indicated that membrane-bound MTf is a key element in melanoma cell transmigration across the BBB and subsequent brain metastasis. Thus, these data suggest MTf as an attractive target and demonstrate the therapeutic potential of an anti-MTf mAb for preventing metastatic melanoma.

This study examined this question by using event-related potentials (ERPs). ERPs were recorded in a recognition memory task in 18 patients and 18 matched control subjects. On an early frontal component, the results show an interaction between sex and pathological condition that results in an apparent reversed sexual dimorphism. On mid-latency components, patients show no sex difference on a frontal component, but a difference on the posterior component, whereas healthy subjects show a reverse pattern. Finally, late components show sex difference in the same direction as healthy subjects. These results indicate that the influence of sex on the cognitive impairment in schizophrenia is not homogenous across the information-processing cascade. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Influence of trait anxiety on brain activity during the acquisition and extinction of aversive conditioning	PSYCHOLOGICAL MEDICINE			English	Article						Amygdala; anterior cingulate cortex; anxiety; context conditioning; extinction; functional magnetic resonance imaging	POSTTRAUMATIC-STRESS-DISORDER; VENTROMEDIAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; STATE WORRY QUESTIONNAIRE; FEAR EXTINCTION; HUMAN AMYGDALA; ACTIVATION; RESPONSES; MEMORY; CONTEXT; TRAUMA	Background. We examined how individual differences in trait anxiety (TA) influence the neural responses associated with the acquisition and extinction of anticipatory anxiety elicited through a context conditioning paradigm, with particular focus Oil the amygdala and the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC). Method. During two sessions of echo-planar functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), 18 healthy volunteers completed a decision-making task with two randomly alternating 28-s to 32-s background screen colour blocks. One of the colours was associated with the presentation of an aversive noise (CTX+) and the other colour was 'safe' (CTX-). In the first session (Acquisition), 33% of CTX+ colour blocks were paired with noise and in the second session (Extinction) no noise was presented. Results. The amygdala displayed an increased response to CTX+ compared to CTX- colour blocks during the Acquisition and Extinction sessions and the ACC displayed an increased response to CTX+ compared to CTX- colour blocks during Extinction only. In addition, a greater conditioned response (CTX + minus CTX-) was observed in the ACC when comparing the Extinction and Acquisition sessions. Correlation analyses further showed that higher levels of TA were associated with a higher conditioned response in the amygdala during Extinction as well as a greater differential conditioned response (i.e. Extinction > Acquisition) in the ACC. Conclusions. Our results support the idea that individuals with high levels of anxiety-relevant traits and vulnerable to developing an anxiety disorder display a more resilient anxiety response during extinction that is characterized by hyper-responsivity in the amygdala.

More specifically, this study attempted to verify the hypothesis that functional limitations in the performance of daily activities negatively affect community functioning in people with schizophrenia. Methods: Eighty-two individuals with schizophrenia living in the community were recruited for the Study. The Perceive, Recall, Plan and Perform (PRPP) System of Task Analysis was used to assess participants' functional capacity during a meal preparation task. Visuo-spatial associative memory, spatial working memory, planning, visuo-motor coordination, and selective attention were evaluated as well. Community functioning was assessed with the Independent Living Skills Survey (ILSS) and the Multnomah Community Ability Scale (MCAS). Results: Correlations revealed significant associations between functional capacity and visuo-spatial associative learning, spatial working memory, planning and negative symptoms. Planning skills during meal preparation were found to be associated with MCAS. After regression analyses, only visuo-spatial memory, negative symptoms, education and familiarity with meal preparation explained variation in functional capacity. Conclusions: The findings of the current study suggest that visuo-spatial associative learning, negative symptoms, education and familiarity with task are among the important factors for functional capacity. Planning skills necessary for efficient task performance were also found to be those most determinant for community functioning. Rehabilitation interventions should consider these underlying strength and deficits when developing strategies to help people with schizophrenia build functional skills essential for community living.

Here, we investigated further the role of EBA in self-other distinctions using low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). As compared with rTMS applied over a control site, rTMS applied over the EBA increased reaction times, without affecting accuracy, for the detection of other-generated movements. Performance on a control motion-direction detection task was unaffected. These findings provide additional evidence for the role of the EBA in processing information necessary for identifying ourselves as agents of self-generated movements.

We question this long-standing view by investigating nonfunctional cholinergic nicotinic synapses in the superior cervical ganglia (SCG) of mice with a disruption in the alpha 3 nicotinic receptor (nAChR) subunit gene, a gene essential for fast synaptic transmission in sympathetic ganglia. Using imaging and electrophysiology, we show that synapses persist for at least 2-3 months without postsynaptic activity; however, the presynaptic terminals lack high-affinity choline transporters (CHTs), and as a result, they are quickly depleted of transmitter. Moreover, we demonstrate with rescue experiments that CHT is induced by signals downstream of postsynaptic activity, converting immature terminals to mature terminals capable of sustaining transmitter release in response to high-frequency or continuous firing. Importantly, postsynaptic neurons must be continually active to maintain CHT in presynaptic terminals.

We hypothesized that nicotinic stimulation of individual GPs exerts divergent regional influences, affecting atrial as well as ventricular functions. In 22 anesthetized canines, unipolar electrograms were recorded from 127 atrial and 127 ventricular epicardial loci during nicotine injection (100 mcg in 0.1 ml) into either the 1) right atrial (RA), 2) dorsal atrial, 3) left atrial, 4) inferior vena cava-inferior left atrial, 5) right ventricular, 6) ventral septal ventricular or 7) cranial medial ventricular (CMV) GP. In addition to sinus and AV nodal function, neural effects on atrial and ventricular repolarization were identified as changes in the area subtended by unipolar recordings under basal conditions and at maximum neurally-induced effects. Animals were studied with intact AV node or following ablation to achieve ventricular rate control. Atrial rate was affected in response to stimulation of all 7 GPs with an incidence of 50-95% of the animals among the different GPs. AV conduction was affected following stimulation of 6/7 GP with an incidence of 22-75% among GPs. Atrial and ventricular repolarization properties were affected by atrial as well as ventricular GP stimulation. Distinct regional patterns of repolarization changes were identified in response to stimulation of individual GPs. RAGP predominantly affected the RA and posterior right ventricular walls whereas CMVGP elicited biatrial and biventricular repolarization changes. Spatially divergent and overlapping cardiac regions are affected in response to nicotinic stimulation of neurons in individual GPs. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The depolarizations last up to minutes, and we tested whether the intrinsic properties required the cooperation of synaptic inputs to maintain RS cells depolarized for such long periods of time. Ascending spinal inputs to RS cells were reversibly blocked by applying xylocaine over the rostral spinal cord segments. The duration of the sustained depolarizations was markedly reduced. The membrane potential oscillations in tune with locomotor activity that were present under control condition were also abolished. The contribution of excitatory glutamatergic inputs was then assessed by applying CNQX and AP-5 over one of two simultaneously recorded homologous RS cells on each side of the brainstem. The level of sensory-evoked depolarization decreased significantly in the cell exposed to the antagonists compared with the other RS cell monitored as a control. In contrast, local application of glycine only produced a transient membrane potential hyperpolarization with a marked reduction in the amplitude of membrane potential oscillations. Locally applied strychnine did not change the duration of the sustained depolarizations, suggesting that mechanisms other than glycinergic inhibition are involved in ending the sustained depolarizations in RS cells. It is concluded that excitatory glutamatergic inputs, including ascending spinal feedback, cooperate with intrinsic properties of RS cells to maintain the cells depolarized for prolonged periods, sustaining long bouts of escape swimming.

Heterochrony and Cross-Species Intersensory Matching by Infant Vervet Monkeys	PLOS ONE			English	Article							SUPERIOR TEMPORAL SULCUS; RHESUS-MONKEY; 1ST YEAR; MULTISENSORY INTEGRATION; BRAIN EVOLUTION; AUDITORY-CORTEX; ALARM CALLS; PERCEPTION; SPEECH; CUES	Background: Understanding the evolutionary origins of a phenotype requires understanding the relationship between ontogenetic and phylogenetic processes. Human infants have been shown to undergo a process of perceptual narrowing during their first year of life, whereby their intersensory ability to match the faces and voices of another species declines as they get older. We investigated the evolutionary origins of this behavioral phenotype by examining whether or not this developmental process occurs in non-human primates as well. Methodology/Principal Findings: We tested the ability of infant vervet monkeys (Cercopithecus aethiops), ranging in age from 23 to 65 weeks, to match the faces and voices of another non-human primate species (the rhesus monkey, Macaca mulatta). Even though the vervets had no prior exposure to rhesus monkey faces and vocalizations, our findings show that infant vervets can, in fact, recognize the correspondence between rhesus monkey faces and voices (but indicate that they do so by looking at the non-matching face for a greater proportion of overall looking time), and can do so well beyond the age of perceptual narrowing in human infants. Our results further suggest that the pattern of matching by vervet monkeys is influenced by the emotional saliency of the Face+Voice combination. That is, although they looked at the non-matching screen for Face+Voice combinations, they switched to looking at the matching screen when the Voice was replaced with a complex tone of equal duration. Furthermore, an analysis of pupillary responses revealed that their pupils showed greater dilation when looking at the matching natural face/voice combination versus the face/tone combination. Conclusions/Significance: Because the infant vervets in the current study exhibited cross-species intersensory matching far later in development than do human infants, our findings suggest either that intersensory perceptual narrowing does not occur in Old World monkeys or that it occurs later in development. We argue that these findings reflect the faster rate of neural development in monkeys relative to humans and the resulting differential interaction of this factor with the effects of early experience.

We show here that the somatosensory system is also involved in the perception of speech. We use a robotic device to create patterns of facial skin deformation that would normally accompany speech production. We find that when we stretch the facial skin while people listen to words, it alters the sounds they hear. The systematic perceptual variation we observe in conjunction with speech-like patterns of skin stretch indicates that somatosensory inputs affect the neural processing of speech sounds and shows the involvement of the somatosensory system in the perceptual processing in speech.

EFFECTS OF CALPAIN INHIBITION ON DOPAMINERGIC MARKERS AND MOTOR FUNCTION FOLLOWING INTRASTRIATAL 6-HYDROXYDOPAMINE ADMINISTRATION IN RATS	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						calpastatin; caspase; dopamine; 6-hydroxydopamine; motor; striatum	SPINAL-CORD-INJURY; CHOLINERGIC RECEPTOR SUBTYPES; MEDIAL FOREBRAIN-BUNDLE; VENTRAL TEGMENTAL AREA; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; NEUROTROPHIC FACTOR; BRAIN-INJURY; CELL-DEATH; PROGRESSIVE DEGENERATION; NEURONAL APOPTOSIS	The neurotoxin 6-hydroxydopamine has been widely used to model aspects of Parkinson's disease in rodents, but the mechanisms underlying toxin-induced dopaminergic degeneration and functional impairment have not been fully elucidated. The main aim of the present study was to assess a possible role for calpains in neurochemical and behavioral deficits following unilateral infusion of intrastriatal 6-hydroxydopamine in adult rats. Toxin administration produced a profound dopaminergic denervation, as indicated by a 90-95% reduction in dopamine transporter radiolabeling measured in the caudate-putamen at 2 weeks post-lesion. Treatment with 6-hydroxydopamine also resulted in calpain activation in both caudate-putamen and substantia nigra, as measured by the appearance of calpain-specific spectrin breakdown products. Calpain activation peaked at 24 h after 6-hydroxydopamine infusion and remained elevated at later time points. In contrast, caspase-3-mediated spectrin cleavage subsided within 48 h in both brain areas. In a subsequent experiment, calpain inhibition was achieved by intrastriatal infusion of an adenovirus expressing the endogenous calpain inhibitor, calpastatin. Calpastatin delivery abolished the lesion-induced calpain-mediated spectrin cleavage and alleviated forelimb asymmetries resulting from unilateral intrastriatal 6-hydroxydopamine. Unexpectedly, dopamine transporter and tyrosine hydroxylase labeling revealed significant neuroprotection, not in the nigrostriatal pathway but rather in the ventral tegmental area. These findings support a role for calpain activation in 6-hydroxydopamine-induced degeneration of dopaminergic neurons. However, after near-total dopaminergic depletion, the primary benefit of calpain inhibition may not occur within the nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway itself. (C) 2009 IBRO.

One cause of familial ALS is missense mutations in the superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) gene. Iron accumulation occurs in the CNS of both forms of ALS; however, its contribution to the pathogenesis of ALS is not known. We examined the role of iron in a transgenic mouse line overexpressing the human SOD1(G37R) mutant. We show that multiple mechanisms may underlie the iron accumulation in neurons and glia in SOD1(G37R) transgenic mice. These include dysregulation of proteins involved in iron influx and sensing of intracellular iron; iron accumulation in ventral motor neurons secondary to blockage of anterograde axonal transport; and increased mitochondrial iron load in neurons and glia. We also show that treatment of SOD1(G37R) mice with an iron chelator extends life span by 5 weeks, accompanied by increased survival of spinal motor neurons and improved locomotor function. These data suggest that iron chelator therapy might be useful for the treatment of ALS.

Nevertheless, induction manipulations, such as viewing interesting movies or performing mathematical tasks, often influence both emotional and attentional states. Imaging studies have examined the neural basis of psychological pain modulation, but none has explicitly separated the effects of emotion and attention. Using odors to modulate mood and shift attention from pain, we previously showed that the perceptual consequences of changing mood differed from those of altering attention, with mood primarily altering pain unpleasantness and attention preferentially altering pain intensity. These findings suggest that brain circuits involved in pain modulation provoked by mood or attention are partially separable. Here we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to directly compare the neurocircuitry involved in mood- and attention-related pain modulation. We manipulated independently mood state and attention direction, using tasks involving heat pain and pleasant and unpleasant odors. Pleasant odors, independent of attentional focus, induced positive mood changes and decreased pain unpleasantness and pain-related activity within the anterior cingulate (ACC), medial thalamus, and primary and secondary somatosensory cortices. The effects of attentional state were less robust, with only the activity in anterior insular cortex (aIC) showing possible attentional modulation. Lateral inferior frontal cortex [LinfF; Brodmann's area (BA) 45/47] activity correlated with mood-related modulation, whereas superior posterior parietal (SPP; BA7) and entorhinal activity correlated with attention-related modulation. ACC activity covaried with LinfF and periacqueductal gray activity, whereas aIC activity covaried with SPP activity. These findings suggest that separate neuromodulatory circuits underlie emotional and attentional modulation of pain.	[Villemure, Chantal; Bushnell, M.

Incidence of acquired demyelination of the CNS in Canadian children	NEUROLOGY			English	Article							ACUTE DISSEMINATED ENCEPHALOMYELITIS; PEDIATRIC MULTIPLE-SCLEROSIS; ACUTE TRANSVERSE MYELITIS; OPTIC NEURITIS; DIAGNOSTIC-CRITERIA; AUTOIMMUNE-DISEASE; CLINICAL-FEATURES; CHILDHOOD; POPULATION	Background: The incidence of acquired demyelination of the CNS (acquired demyelinating syndromes [ADS]) in children is unknown. It is important that physicians recognize the features of ADS to facilitate care and to appreciate the future risk of multiple sclerosis (MS). Objective: To determine the incidence, clinical features, familial autoimmune history, and acute management of Canadian children with ADS. Methods: Incidence and case-specific data were obtained through the Canadian Pediatric Surveillance Program from April 1, 2004, to March 31, 2007. Before study initiation, a survey was sent to all pediatric health care providers to determine awareness of MS as a potential outcome of ADS in children. Results: Two hundred nineteen children with ADS (mean age 10.5 years, range 0.66-18.0 years; female to male ratio 1.09:1) were reported. The most common presentations were optic neuritis (ON; n = 51, 23%), acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM; n = 49, 22%), and transverse myelitis (TM; n = 48, 22%). Children with ADEM were more likely to be younger than 10 years, whereas children with monolesional ADS (ON, TM, other) were more likely to be older than 10 years (p < 0.001). There were 73 incident cases per year, leading to an annual incidence of 0.9 per 100,000 Canadian children. A family history of MS was reported in 8%. Before study initiation, 65% of physicians indicated that they considered MS as a possible outcome of ADS in children. This increased to 74% in year 1, 81% in year 2, and 87% in year 3. Conclusion: The incidence of pediatric acquired demyelinating syndromes (ADS) is 0.9 per 100,000 Canadian children. ADS presentations are influenced by age.

Recent Work has linked the expression of evolutionarily conserved transcription factors to key features of interneurons in diverse species, raising the possibility that these interneurons are functionally related. Consequently, the determinants of interneuron subtypes are predicted to share conserved cis-regulation in vertebrates with very different spinal cords. Here, we establish a link between cis-regulation and morphology of spinal interneurons that express the Evx1 homeodomain transcription factor from fish to mammals. Using comparative genomics, and complementary transgenic approaches, we have identified a novel enhancer of evx1, that includes two non-coding elements conserved in vertebrates. We show that pufferfish evx1 transgenes containing this enhancer direct reporter expression to a subset of spinal commissural interneurons in zebrafish embryos. Pufferfish, zebrafish and mouse evx1 downstream genomic enhancers label selectively Evx1+ V0 commissural interneurons in chick and rat embryos. By dissecting the zebrafish evx1 enhancer, we identify a role for a 25 bp conserved cis-element in V0-specific gene expression. Our findings support the notion that spinal interneurons shared between distantly related vertebrates, have been maintained in part via the preservation of highly conserved cis-regulatory modules.

These functions are often interdependent, and rely on a high degree of specificity in homophilic binding as well as heterophilic interactions. The Drosophila receptor Dscam is an exceptional example of homophilic binding specificity involved in a number of important biological processes, such as neural wiring and innate immunity. Combinatorial use of alternatively spliced Ig-domains enables the generation of an estimated 18,000 isoform-specific homophilic receptor pairs. Although isoform diversity of Dscam is unique to arthropods, recent genetic analysis of vertebrate DSCAM( Down Syndrome Cell Adhesion Molecule) genes has revealed an intriguing conservation of molecular functions underlying neural wiring. This review covers the multiple functions of Dscam across different species highlighting its remarkable versatility as well as its conserved basic functions in neural development. We discuss how an unprecedented expansion of complex alternative splicing has been uniquely employed by arthropods to generate diverse surface receptors, important for cell-cell communication, molecular self-recognition in neurons, and innate immune defenses.

J	Boisvert, CA				Boisvert, Catherine Anne			Vertebral Development of Modern Salamanders Provides Insights Into a Unique Event of Their Evolutionary History	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL ZOOLOGY PART B-MOLECULAR AND DEVELOPMENTAL EVOLUTION			English	Article							PHYLOGENY; ONTOGENY; ORIGIN; DIVERSIFICATION; TEMNOSPONDYLS; TETRAPODS	The origin of salamanders and their interrelationships to the two other modern amphibian orders (frogs and caecilians) are problematic owing to an 80-100 million year gap in the fossil record between the Carboniferous to the Lower Jurassic. This is compounded by a scarcity of adult skeletal characters linking the early representatives of the modern orders to their stem-group in the Paleozoic. The use of ontogenetic characters can be of great use in the resolution of these questions. Growth series of all ten modern salamander families (a 120 cleared and stained larvae) were examined for pattern and timing of vertebral elements chondrification and ossification. The primitive pattern is that of the neural arches developing before the centra, while the reverse represents the derived condition. Both the primitive and derived conditions are observed within the family Hynobiidae, whereas only the derived condition is observed in all other salamanders. This provides support to the claims that Hynobiidae is both the most basal of modern families and potentially polyphyletic (with Ranodon and Hybobius forming the most basal clade and Salamandrella being a part of the most derived Blade). This provides insight into a unique event in salamander evolutionary history and suggests that the developmental pattern switch occurred between the Triassic and the mid-Jurassic before the last major radiation.

Investigations on spinal cord fMRI of cats under ketamine	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						fMRI; Spinal cord; Cat; Bold; Reproducibility; Noise; CO2	CEREBRAL-BLOOD-FLOW; HIGH-RESOLUTION FMRI; FUNCTIONAL MRI; GRADIENT-ECHO; PHYSIOLOGICAL NOISE; SPATIAL LOCALIZATION; OXYGEN-CONSUMPTION; RESPONSE FUNCTION; BOLD CONTRIBUTION; DEPENDENT BOLD	Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of the spinal cord has been the subject of intense research for the last ten years. An important motivation for this technique is its ability to detect non-invasively neuronal activity in the spinal cord related to sensorimotor functions in various conditions, such as after spinal cord lesions. Although promising results of spinal cord fMRI have arisen from previous studies, the poor reproducibility of BOLD activations and their characteristics remain a major drawback. In the present study we investigated the reproducibility of BOLD fMRI in the spinal cord of cats (N=9) by repeating the same stimulation protocol over a long period (similar to 2 h). Cats were anaesthetized with ketamine, and spinal cord activity was induced by electrical stimulation of cutaneous nerves of the hind limbs. As a result, task-related signals were detected in most cats with relatively good spatial specificity. However, BOLD response significantly varied within and between cats. This variability was notably attributed to the moderate intensity of the stimulus producing a low amplitude haemodynamic response, variation in end-tidal CO2 during the session, low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in spinal fMRI time series and animal-specific vascular anatomy. Original contributions of the present study are: (i) first spinal fMRI experiment in ketamine-anaesthetized animals, (ii) extensive study of intra- and inter-subject variability of activation, (iii) characterisation of static and temporal SNR in the spinal cord and (iv) investigation on the impact of CO2 end-tidal level on the amplitude of BOLD response.

Recent advances obtained from genetic, physiological, pharmacological, and biochemical studies provide strong evidence that translational control plays a key role in regulating long-term changes in neural circuits and thus long-term modifications in behavior. Translational control is important for regulating both general protein synthesis and synthesis of specific proteins in response to neuronal activity. In this review, we summarize and discuss recent progress in the field and highlight the prospects for better understanding of long-lasting changes in synaptic strength, learning, and memory and implications for neurological diseases.

We investigated the mechanisms underpinning cerebellar oscillations. We found that Golgi interneurons, which gate information transfer in the cerebellar cortex input layer, are extensively coupled through electrical synapses. When depolarized in vitro, these neurons displayed low-frequency oscillatory synchronization, imposing rhythmic inhibition onto granule cells. Combining experiments and modeling, we show that electrical transmission of the spike afterhyperpolarization is the essential component for oscillatory population synchronization. Rhythmic firing arises in spite of strong heterogeneities, is frequency tuned by the mean excitatory input to Golgi cells, and displays pronounced resonance when the modeled network is driven by oscillating inputs. In vivo, unitary Golgi cell activity was found to synchronize with low-frequency LFP oscillations occurring during quiet waking. These results suggest a major role for Golgi cells in coordinating cerebellar sensorimotor integration during oscillatory interactions.

Hence, characterization of drug disposition over a wide range of conditions of these membrane transporters activities is required to better characterize drug pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. This work aims to improve our understanding of the impact of P-gp activity modulation on tissue distribution of P-gp substrate. Methods: A PBPK model was developed in order to examine activity and expression of P-gp transporters in mouse brain and heart. Drug distribution in these tissues was first represented by a well-stirred (WS) model and then refined by a mechanistic transport-based (MTB) model that includes P-gp mediated transport of the drug. To estimate transport-related parameters, we developed an original three-step procedure that allowed extrapolation of in vitro measurements of drug permeability to the in vivo situation. The model simulations were compared to a limited set of data in order to assess the model ability to reproduce the important information of drug distributions in the considered tissues. Results: This PBPK model brings insights into the mechanism of drug distribution in non eliminating tissues expressing P-gp. The MTB model accounts for the main transport mechanisms involved in drug distribution in heart and brain. It points out to the protective role of P-gp at the blood-brain barrier and represents thus a noticeable improvement over the WS model. Conclusion: Being built prior to in vivo data, this approach brings an interesting alternative to fitting procedures, and could be adapted to different drugs and transporters. The physiological based model is novel and unique and brought effective information on drug transporters.

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by the mitochondrial metabolism have been postulated to be the central source of molecular damages and imbalance between levels of intracellular ROS and antioxidant defenses is a characteristic of the aging brain. How aging modifies free radicals concentrations and increases the risk to develop most neurodegenerative diseases is poorly understood, however. Here we show that the Polycomb group and oncogene Bmi1 is required in neurons to suppress apoptosis and the induction of a premature aging-like program characterized by reduced antioxidant defenses. Before weaning, Bmi1(-/-) mice display a progeroid-like ocular and brain phenotype, while Bmi1(-/-) mice, although apparently normal, have reduced lifespan. Bmi1 deficiency in neurons results in increased p19(Arf)/p53 levels, abnormally high ROS concentrations, and hypersensitivity to neurotoxic agents. Most Bmi1 functions on neurons' oxidative metabolism are genetically linked to repression of p53 pro-oxidant activity, which also operates in physiological conditions. In Bmi1(-/-) neurons, p53 and corepressors accumulate at antioxidant gene promoters, correlating with a repressed chromatin state and antioxidant gene downregulation. These findings provide a molecular mechanism explaining how Bmi1 regulates free radical concentrations and reveal the biological impact of Bmi1 deficiency on neuronal survival and aging.

However, the underlying mechanism(s) and interrelationships between these factors mostly remain to be established. In the present study, we show that glutamate attenuates the tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) receptor and the survival effect of IGF-1 (100 nM) in hippocampal cultured neurons. Pretreatment of cultured hippocampal neurons with glutamate concentration dependently inhibited the tyrosine phosphorylation of IGF-1 receptors as well as that of IRS-1 and Shc, two IGF-1 receptor adapter proteins. The effect of glutamate was also evident on the phosphorylation of Akt, as well as its upstream kinase PI3K/PDK1 and downstream targets, GSK3 beta and FOXO3a. The inhibitory effect of glutamate (1 mM) was blocked by antagonists of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, including MK801 (20 mu M) and AP5 (100 mu M), but not by blockers of other ionotropic or metabotropic glutamate receptor sub-types demonstrating the involvement of the NMDA receptor. This hypothesis is supported further by the observation that treatment with NMDA concentration dependently inhibited the activation and phosphorylation of IGF-1 receptors and downstream targets induced by IGF-1 (100 nM). These findings demonstrate that glutamate can block the effect of IGF-1 by decreasing IGF-1 receptor signaling and responsiveness, hence attenuating the survival properties of this trophic factor in neuronal cells. Our results also suggest a novel mechanism by which glutamate can reduce cell viability and induce neurotoxicity.

Akt phosphorylation of La regulates specific mRNA translation in glial progenitors	ONCOGENE			English	Article						Ras/Akt pathway; La autoantigen; translation; ribonomics; polysomes	BINDING PROTEIN; IN-VIVO; GLIOBLASTOMA FORMATION; ENHANCES TRANSLATION; NEURAL PROGENITORS; TRANSGENIC MICE; POLIOVIRUS RNA; AUTOANTIGEN LA; SS-B; ANTIGEN	The Akt signaling pathway activity increases as normal tissue progresses to malignant transformation, and regulates the translation of specific messenger RNAs (mRNAs) through multiple mechanisms. We have identified one such mechanism of Akt-dependent translation control as involving the lupus autoantigen La. La is an RNA-associated protein that contains multiple trafficking elements to support the interaction with RNAs in different subcellular locations. We show here that the La protein is a direct target of the serine/threonine protein kinase Akt on threonine 301, and La nuclear export in mouse glial progenitors, as well as its association with polysomes is modulated by Akt activity. Using a functional approach to determine the network of genes affected by La in the cytoplasm by microarray analysis of polysome-bound mRNAs, we found that La binds 34% of the polysome bound mRNAs and regulates the expression of a specific pool of mRNAs under KRas/Akt activation. Therefore, La appears to be an important contributor to Akt-mediated translational regulation of these transcripts in murine glial cells.	[Brenet, F.; Holland, E.

This study addresses the question by relating anatomical measurements of Heschl's gyrus ( HG), the structure containing human primary auditory cortex, to how this region processes temporal and spectral acoustic information. In this study, subjects' right and left HG were identified and manually indicated on anatomical magnetic resonance imaging scans. Volumes of gray matter, white matter, and total gyrus were recorded, and asymmetry indices were calculated. Additionally, cortical auditory activity in response to noise stimuli varying orthogonally in temporal and spectral dimensions was assessed and related to the volumetric measurements. A high degree of anatomical variability was seen, consistent with other reports in the literature. The auditory cortical responses showed the expected leftward lateralization to varying rates of stimulus change and rightward lateralization of increasing spectral information. An explicit link between auditory structure and function is then established, in which anatomical variability of auditory cortex is shown to relate to individual differences in the way that cortex processes acoustic information. Specifically, larger volumes of left HG were associated with larger extents of rate-related cortex on the left, and larger volumes of right HG related to larger extents of spectral-related cortex on the right. This finding is discussed in relation to known microanatomical asymmetries of HG, including increased myelination of its fibers, and implications for language learning are considered.

This study uses the St Kitts vervet monkey, a species that voluntarily consumes beverage alcohol, to examine the effects of prenatal ethanol exposure. Pregnant vervets were allowed to drink the equivalent of 3-5 standard drinks four times a week during the third trimester. Using unbiased stereology, we estimated neuronal reduction and found significantly fewer cells in the frontal lobes of FASD offspring as well as an increased density of interstitial white matter neurons. These cytoarchitectonic effects are consistent with the behavioral and cognitive changes observed in FASD.

A novel Refsum-like disorder that maps to chromosome 20	NEUROLOGY			English	Article							MARIE-TOOTH-DISEASE; MULTIPOINT LINKAGE ANALYSIS; IDENTIFICATION; NEUROPATHY; MOTOR; GENE; DUPLICATION; MUTATIONS; PROGRAM; 17P11.2	Objective: Clinical and genetic characterization of a neurologic disorder resembling Refsum disease in a Norwegian consanguineous family. Methods: The affected individuals comprise a brother and sister and their third cousin. The family comes from a small island community and genealogic studies showed that both sets of parents are descendants of a man born in 1585. Based on the hypothesis that this is an autosomal recessive disease and that the patients were homozygous for the same mutation (identical by descent), we used homozygosity mapping to define the genetic locus of this disorder. Results: This slowly progressive disorder starts in childhood with signs of peripheral neuropathy (pes cavus, tendoachilles contracture). Hearing loss and cataract become evident in the third decade. Subsequently, patients develop a disorder of gait due to the combination of ataxia and spasticity, and a pigment retinopathy. While the clinical picture is reminiscent of Refsum disease, affected individuals have normal phytanic and pristanic acid levels in plasma, as well as normal enzymatic activity for alpha-oxidation. We mapped the disease to a 15.96 Mb region on chromosome 20 (20p11.21-q12), containing approximately 200 genes (maximum lod score = 6.3). Sequencing of 23 candidate genes failed to demonstrate detrimental sequence variants. Conclusions: Our findings show that the clinical syndromes that include Refsum disease are more heterogeneous than previously recognized. We have chosen to report the clinical features and mapping of this novel disorder in the hope that this will permit identification of other families and thus proper genetic characterization.

Methods: In the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled core study, 281 patients received placebo or FTY720, 1.25 or 5.0 mg/day, for 6 months. During the subsequent dose-blinded extension, patients assigned to placebo were re-randomized to either dose of FTY720; those originally assigned to FTY720 continued at the same dose. Patients receiving FTY720 5.0 mg were switched to 1.25 mg during the month 15 to month 24 study visits. Results: Of 281 patients randomized in the core study, 250 (89%) entered the extension phase, and 189 (75.6%) received treatment for 24 months. During the core study, FTY720 significantly reduced gadolinium-enhanced (Gd(+)) lesions and annualized relapse rate (ARR) compared with placebo, with no differences between doses. During the extension phase, patients who switched from placebo to FTY720 showed clear reductions in ARR and lesion counts compared with the placebo phase; ARR and lesion counts remained low in patients who continued FTY720 treatment. After 24 months, 79 to 91% of patients were free from Gd(+) lesions and up to 77% of patients remained relapse free. FTY720 was well tolerated; no new safety concerns emerged during months 7 to 24 compared with the 6-month core study. Conclusions: Once-daily oral treatment with FTY720, 1.25 or 5.0 mg, for up to 2 years, was well tolerated and was associated with low relapse rates and lesion activity.

Physiological evidence of a postsynaptic inhibition of the tail flick reflex by a cannabinoid receptor agonist	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Cannabinoid; WIN 55,212-2; Nociception; Analgesic; Tail flick test; Spinal cord; (Rat)	RAT SPINAL-CORD; DYNAMIC-RANGE NEURONS; MU-OPIOID RECEPTORS; LUMBAR DORSAL-HORN; NOCICEPTIVE RESPONSES; ANALGESIC ACTIVITY; SUBSTANCE-P; EXPRESSION; MICE; ANTINOCICEPTION	Current evidence indicates that cannabinoids are antinociceptive and this effect is in part mediated by spinal mechanisms. Anatomical studies have localized cannabinoid CB(1) receptors to pre- and postsynaptic sites within the spinal cord. However, behavioural tests have not clearly indicated the relative importance of each of these sites. In this study, the tail flick test was used as a model of acute pain in the rat to determine the site of action of WIN 55,212-2 ((R)-(+)-[2,3-dihydro-5-methyl-3[(4-morpholinyl)methyl]pyrolo[1,2,3-de]-1,4-benzoxazinyl]-(1-naphthalenyl)methanone mesylate), a synthetic cannabinoid receptor agonist. WIN 55,212-2 (3 mg/kg, i.p.) increased the latency of tail withdrawal from a noxious radiant heat source, indicating it is antinociceptive in this model. Using the same paradigm, WIN 55,212-2 was then tested against the synaptically-induced nociceptive hypersensitivity in response to noxious thermal stimulation of the tail (hot water tail immersion). WIN 55,212-2 blocked this hypersensitivity, confirming a spinal site of action of the cannabinoid receptor agonist. Further, WIN 55,212-2 blocked the nociceptive hypersensitivity induced by intrathecal administration of substance P. As substance P acts on postsynaptic tachykinin NK1 receptors in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, the data are interpreted to suggest that WIN 55,212-2 expressed its anti-hypersensitivity effects at least partially via a postsynaptic site of action; the data do not rule out a presynaptic site of action. This study suggests that cannabinoids may induce analgesia via a postsynaptic site of action in the spinal cord, as well as the possibility that they may interact with substance P signaling.

Discovering drugs that act on the high rate of aging in older individuals could be a means of combating these diseases. Reduction of the activity of the mitochondrial enzyme CLK-1 (also known as COQ7) slows down aging in Caenorhabditis elegans and in mice. Clioquinol is a metal chelator that has beneficial effects in several cellular and animal models of neurodegenerative diseases as well as on Alzheimer disease patients. Here we show that clioquinol inhibits the activity of mammalian CLK-1 in cultured cells, an inhibition that can be blocked by iron or cobalt cations, suggesting that chelation is involved in the mechanism of action of clioquinol on CLK-1. We also show that treatment of nematodes and mice with clioquinol mimics a variety of phenotypes produced by mutational reduction of CLK-1 activity in these organisms. These results suggest that the surprising action of clioquinol on several age-dependent neurodegenerative diseases with distinct etiologies might result from a slowing down of the aging process through action of the drug on CLK-1. Our findings support the hypothesis that pharmacologically targeting aging-associated proteins could help relieve age-dependent diseases.

Several approaches have been followed to lower noise: denoising reconstructed images with spatial wavelets, adding a priori information during reconstruction about the signal without noise, including the temporal dimension during reconstruction. In this work, we propose to use a temporal wavelet denoising approach, based on the characteristics of PET time activity curves in sinograms (or reconstructed images). This approach has recently been proposed in image processing and relies on discriminating signal from noise by including relevant "a priori" information (on the statistical distribution of the wavelet coefficient for a whole sinogram or reconstructed image), as well as appropriate noise formation model in the time domain. This approach is tested in a 2D spatial + ID time Monte Carlo simulation mimicking brain, and compared with a standard denoising approach : SUREShrink. Preliminary results indicate that better performances are obtained for sinogram denoising with the proposed approach compared with SUREShrink, and that the resulting sinograms can be reconstructed with a weighted least-squares (WLS) algorithm for all techniques. Denoising in the reconstructed images with this approach was also investigated.	[Sureau, F. C.; Comtat, C.; Trebossen, R.] SHFJ, I2BM, DSV, CEA, Orsay, France; [Sureau, F.

However, this approach is quite complex in case of human PET imaging due to the large memory requirements in storage and computaionally expensive simulation of the system matrix. To address these problems, we adapted a rotator based maximum likelihood expectation maximum (ML-EM) reconstruction algorithm and a fast Monte Carlo simulator. In this paper, a Gaussian rotator is used with the ML-EM algorithm. This algorithm enables the full utilization of the rotational symmetry to reduce the storage of the system matrix, as well as the simulation cost. The fast system matrix simulator is based on egs_pet, a Monte Carlo code using EGSnrc. For a brain-size field of view, the system matrix storage requirement is reduced by a factor of 131,083 with regard to that of the full system matrix. This reduction is achieved by using symmetries and a sparse matrix representation. This enables the system matrix to reside in the main memory of a modern desktop. By combining the symmetry with the fast system matrix simulator, the simulation time is reduced by a factor of 9,240 with regard to an analog GATE simulation. The quality of the reconstructed image was evaluated with the contrast recovery versus background noise. Significant improvements were found with regard to the standard ray-tracing ML-EM.

Observer Based Control of Piezoelectric Actuators with Classical Duhem Modeled Hysteresis	2009 AMERICAN CONTROL CONFERENCE, VOLS 1-9	PROCEEDINGS OF THE AMERICAN CONTROL CONFERENCE		English	Proceedings Paper	American Control Conference 2009	JUN 10-12, 2009	St Louis, MO				NONLINEAR-SYSTEMS; FERROMAGNETIC HYSTERESIS; ADAPTIVE-CONTROL; MOTION CONTROL; IDENTIFICATION; NETWORKS	An observer-based adaptive control scheme for piezoelectric actuators is proposed. In the developed method the classical Duhem model is adopted to describe the hysteresis exhibited in the piezoelectric actuators. Due to the unavailability of the hysteresis output, an observer-based adaptive controller, with incorporation of a pre-inversion neural network compensator for the purpose of mitigating the hysteretic effects, is designed to guarantee the stability of the adaptive system and tracking error between the position of the piezoelectric actuator and the desired trajectory to a desired precision. Simulation studies illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

S	Yao, JG; Liu, X; Zhu, XP			IEEE	Yao, Jianguo; Liu, Xue; Zhu, Xiaoping			Asymptotically Stable Adaptive Critic Design for Uncertain Nonlinear Systems	2009 AMERICAN CONTROL CONFERENCE, VOLS 1-9	Proceedings of the American Control Conference		English	Proceedings Paper	American Control Conference 2009	JUN 10-12, 2009	St Louis, MO					Recently, Adaptive critic design (ACD) has been applied to controller design extensively. It is a powerful approach to cope with the model nonlinearity and uncertainties. Existing ACD-based controllers have been proven as uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB). However, UUB only makes the tracking error converge to a certain bounded region. Although we can minimize the bounded region by increasing the number of the hidden nodes of the neural networks in the ACD, the computation cost of the ACD-based controller increases. In many engineering applications, we prefer the asymptotical stability which can ensure the tracking error converges to zero. In this paper, we propose a novel asymptotically stable ACD-based controller for a class of uncertain nonlinear systems. This controller firstly uses the feedback linearization to improve the system dynamic characteristics, and then combines ACD and variable structure control to achieve the asymptotical stability under large model uncertainties. An empirical study is conducted on a 2-link manipulator to validate the new controller design approach. Results show that the nonlinear system using the proposed controller can achieve asymptotical stability and good dynamic response characteristics when large model uncertainties exist.

Mother wavelet function of tenth order Daubechies (d10) was employed to decompose signals in 5 levels. Next, WP coefficients were used to measure energy and Shannon entropy features at different spectral sub-bands. Consequently, using fuzzy c-means method, signals were clustered into 2 classes. The amount of fuzzy membership of pathological and normal signals in their corresponding clusters was considered as a measure to quantify the discrimination ability of features. A classification accuracy of 100 percent was achieved using an artificial neural network classifier. Finally, fuzzy c-means clustering method was used as a way of voice pathology assessment. Accordingly, fuzzy membership function based health index is proposed.	[Aghazadeh, B. Seyed] Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Dept Mech Engn, Richmond, VA 23284 USA; [Heris, H.

Such devices decode raw neural data to obtain direct control signals for external devices. They can also perform data compression and vastly reduce the bandwidth and consequently power expended in wireless transmission of raw data from implantable brain-machine interfaces. We describe a biomimetic algorithm and micropower analog circuit architecture for decoding neural cell ensemble signals. The decoding algorithm implements a continuous-time artificial neural network, using a bank of adaptive linear filters with kernels that emulate synaptic dynamics. The filters transform neural signal inputs into control-parameter outputs, and can be tuned automatically in an on-line learning process.

A Hybrid Extended Least Squares Method (HybELS) for Vestibulo-Ocular Reflex Identification	2009 ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY, VOLS 1-20	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	Annual International Conference of the IEEE-Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society	SEP 03-06, 2009	Minneapolis, MN	IEEE Engn Med & Biol Soc			NYSTAGMUS	The Vestibulo-Ocular Reflex (VOR) plays an essential role in the majority of daily activities by keeping the images of the world steady on the retina when either the environment or the body is moving. The modeling and identification of this system plays a key role in the diagnosis and treatment of various diseases and lesions, and their associated syndromes. Today, clinical protocols incorporate mathematical techniques for testing the functionality of patients' VORs through the analysis of the patients' responses to various stimuli. We have developed a new tool for simultaneous identification of the two modes of the horizontal VOR, using a novel algorithm. This algorithm, HybELS (Hybrid Extended Least Squares), is a regression-based identification method tailored for hybrid ARMAX (Auto Regressive Moving Average with eXogenous inputs) models, which can also be used for the identification of other neural systems. In the context of the VOR, MELS (Modified Extended Least Squares) has been proposed previously for the identification of vestibular nystagmus dynamics, one mode at a time. It also involved searching for segment initial conditions to avoid biased results. Our hybrid approach identifies the two modes simultaneously, and does not require estimation of initial conditions, since it takes advantage of state continuity in the transitions between fast and slow phases. The results on experimental VOR in the dark show that HybELS outperforms MELS in several aspects: It proves to be more robust than MELS with respect to the system order used for identification, while resulting in more accurate estimates in almost all contexts as well. Furthermore, due to the hybrid nature of the method, its calculations are algebraically more compact, and HybELS turns out to be much less computationally expensive than MELS.

The Minnesota Living with Heart Failure questionnaire (MLHFQ) is the instrument most widely used to evaluate QoL in Heart Failure (HF) patients. It is a questionnaire containing 21 questions with scores ranging from 0 to 105. A best cut-off value for MLHFQ scores to identify those patients with good, moderate or poor QoL has not been determined. OBJECTIVE: To determine a cut-off score for the MLHFQ based on the neural network (NN) approach. These cut-off scores will help discriminate between HF patients having good, moderate or poor QoL. METHODS: This research was carried out in the context of a longitudinal cohort study of new patients attending specialized HF clinics in six participating centers in Quebec, Canada. Patients completed a questionnaire that included the MLHFQ. In addition to this scale, self-perceived health status and clinical information related to the severity of HF were obtained including: the New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class, 6 minute walk test and survival status. We analyzed the database using NN and conventional statistical tools. The NN is a statistical program that recognizes clusters of MLHFQ and relates similar QoL measures to one another. Among the 531 eligible patients, 447 patients with complete questionnaires were used to build randomly two sets for training (learning set) and for testing (validation set) the NN. RESULTS: Participants had a mean age of 65 years and 24% were women. The median MLHFQ score was 45 (inter-quartile range: 27 to 64). NN identified 3 distinct clusters of MLHFQ that represent the full spectrum of possible scores on the MLHFQ. We estimated that a score of < 24 on the MLHFQ represents a good QoL, a score between 24 and 45 represents a moderate QoL, and a score > 45 represents a poor QoL. Validation with the different severity measures confirmed these categories. These cut-offs allowed us to reach a good total accuracy (91%). These cutoffs were strongly correlated with survival status (p= 0.004), self-perceived health status (p=0.0032), NYHA functional class (p<0.0001) and standardized 6 minutes walk test (p=0.05) CONCLUSION: The identification of three levels of MLHFQ should be useful in clinical decision making.

We characterize the brownian motion of water by a 3D random walk described by a stochastic non-linear differential equation. We show that the maximum-likelihood trajectories are 3D elastica, or curves of least energy. We illustrate the model with Monte-Carlo (sequential) simulations and then develop a more efficient (local, parallelizable) implementation, based on the Fokker-Planck equation. The final algorithm allows us to efficiently compute stochastic completion fields to connect a source region to a sink region, while taking into account the underlying diffusion MRI data. We demonstrate promising tractography results using high angular resolution diffusion data as input.

Nowadays, parallel programmable logic devices, such as the field programmable gate array (FPGA), have become powerful hardware options, offering low cost, high execution speed, reconfigurability and parallelism. This work intends to exploit the current available resources in commercial FPGAs to implement servo control for hard disk drive system. Simulation and experimental results included in this paper show the viability of exploiting the parallelism and modularity of a low cost FPGA to implement a high sampling rate neural network-based controller. This FPGA-based servo control system platform will allow fast prototyping of new control concepts and evaluation of nonlinear control. The implementation results show that it is possible to develop much higher servo sampling rate controller and more sophisticated controller on FPGA to achieve the tracking density target for 10 Terabit/in(2) disk drive technology.

Cortical patterns are represented in terms of generic scale-invariant image features. Learning automatically identifies a set of features that occur with statistical regularity in appearance and geometry from a large set of MR volume renderings, based on a predescribed anatomical region of interest. A filtering technique is presented for distinguishing between valid cortical features and those likely to arise from incorrect correspondences, based on feature geometry. Expert validation of 100 feature instances shows that 77% correctly identify the same underlying cortical structure in different brains despite high inter-subject variability, and filtering improves the ability to identify the most meaningful patterns.

Motion-Compensated Fully 4D PET Reconstruction using PET Data Supersets	2009 IEEE NUCLEAR SCIENCE SYMPOSIUM CONFERENCE RECORD, VOLS 1-5	IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Conference 2009	OCT 25-31, 2009	Orlando, FL	IEEE, Nucl Plasma Sci Sect, IEEE			POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; HEAD MOTION; TRACKING SYSTEM; IMAGE-RECONSTRUCTION; NEUROLOGICAL PET; MOVEMENT; IMPLEMENTATION; ACQUISITION; PERFORMANCE; SCHEME	Patient head movement not only inhibits the full potential of high spatial-resolution neurological PET imaging, but it also significantly degrades fully 4D reconstruction when using temporally-extensive basis functions. In this case a single movement in just one of the time frames propagates to impact the reconstruction of all other time frames. Here we propose a motion-compensation strategy through the use of PET data supersets and demonstrate its application to fully 4D reconstruction. The richly-sampled superset is populated by considering head motion as equivalent to shifts in scanner position. This requires the positioning of the list-mode events into the superset and the creation of time-dependent normalisation factors for the superset. An advantage of this approach is that the attenuation factors for the superset need only be computed once for the reference position. This approach adapts readily for use with existing fully 4D reconstruction methods with the only modification being the introduction of time-dependent normalisation factors. Using simulated as well as real high-resolution PET data from the HRRT, we demonstrate both the detrimental impact of head motion in fully 4D PET reconstruction as well as the efficacy of our proposed motion-compensation method.

PET Projection Data Supersets for Reconstruction with Acquisition Motion	2009 IEEE NUCLEAR SCIENCE SYMPOSIUM CONFERENCE RECORD, VOLS 1-5	IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Conference 2009	OCT 25-31, 2009	Orlando, FL	IEEE, Nucl Plasma Sci Sect, IEEE			POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; LIST-MODE DATA; RESPIRATORY MOTION; HEAD MOTION; TRACKING SYSTEM; COMPUTED-TOMOGRAPHY; NEUROLOGICAL PET; RESOLUTION; IMAGES; COMPENSATION	Motion during PET data acquisition is either introduced by design (e.g. couch wobble, detector rotation, bed translations) or through motion of the subject (e.g. rigid body motion of the head, respiratory motion). At present such effects are generally considered very differently in PET imaging, with intentional motion regarded as beneficial for enriching data sampling whilst subject motion is regarded as a detrimental effect to be eliminated. In this paper we propose the framework of PET projection data supersets leading to a generalisation of PET image reconstruction in the presence of any type of known acquisition motion. This could open the way to optimal and unified exploitation of all sources of motion in image reconstruction. Our work includes rigid body and elastic object motion. As such, conventional motion-compensation techniques are special cases of our proposed method. We propose different approaches for the practical implementation of the PET data superset and reveal both the connections and differences between them. Using simulated data, we demonstrate the PET data superset framework and its potential to exploit known object motion to the benefit of reconstruction.

In particular, the design and implementation of the ADC with operation similar to a natural neuron cell in that it produces actions potentials corresponding to a stimulus of sufficient strength is described. An energy-saving buffer by reducing its effective capacitance is proposed to achieve low power consumption, and a specially designed switch and calibration system were incorporated in the design to improve the integral non-linearity (INL) of the ADC. The circuit was implemented in a standard 0.18 mu m CMOS process technology with a 1.5V supply, and a compact core area of 0.05 mm(2). Post layout simulations reveal that for a full scale range input current of 16 mu A, the ADC maintains a maximum differential non-linearity (DNL) and INL of less than 0.16 LSB and 0.41 LSB respectively. The ADC achieves an ultra low energy dissipation of 5.46 pJ/cycle when operated at a sampling rate of 500 kS/s. This energy consumption is one of the lowest ever reported to date.

By recognizing partial-onset seizures, it can improve epilepsy treatment. The circuit consists of a chopper stabilized preamplifier, comprising a modulator, an amplifier, a high-pass filter with low cut-off frequency, and a voltage span detector. The proposed low-power detector extracts seizure onset information from neural signals and monitors the signals over a time period to capture seizure events. Signals are analyzed and the mathematical model is validated in Matlab. Circuits are implemented in a CMOS 0.18-mu m process. Total power consumption of the preamplifier and detector are 6.72 uW and 55.51 nW, respectively. Detection performance was verified using intracerebral electroencephalographic recordings from epileptic patients, and the detector accurately identified seizure onsets.

Specifically, the proposed FDI scheme is developed for Pulsed Plasma Thrusters (PPT) that are considered to be used in satellite's Attitude Control Subsystem (ACS). By using the relative attitudes of satellites in the formation our proposed "High Level" fault diagnoser scheme can detect a pair of thrusters that are faulty. This high level diagnoser however cannot isolate the faulty satellite in the formation. Towards this end, a novel "Integrated" dynamic neural network (DNN)-based FDI scheme is proposed to achieve both fault detection and fault isolation of the formation flying of satellites. This methodology involves an "optimal" fusion of the "High Level" FDI scheme with a DNN-based "Low Level" FDI scheme that was recently developed by the authors. To demonstrate the FDI capabilities of our proposed schemes various fault scenarios are simulated and a comparative study among the techniques is performed.

Understanding how it works is an exciting challenge from both a mechanistic and an evolutionary perspective. In this review, we use key examples to examine the proximate mechanisms by which parasites are known to control the behaviour of their hosts. Special attention is given to the recent developments of post-genomic tools, such as proteomics, for determining the genetic basis of parasitic manipulation. We then discuss two novel perspectives on host manipulation (mafia-like strategy and exploitation of host compensatory responses), arguing that parasite-manipulated behaviours could be the result of compromises between host and parasite strategies. Such compromises may occur when collaborating with the parasite is less costly for the host in terms of fitness than is resisting parasite-induced changes. Therefore, even when changes in host behaviour benefit the parasite, the host may still play some role in the switch in host behaviour. in other words, the host does not always become part of the parasite's extended phenotype. For example, parasites that alter host behaviour appear to induce widely disseminated changes in the hosts' central nervous system, as opposed to targeted attacks on specific neural circuits. In some host-parasite systems, the change in host behaviour appears to require the active participation of the host (e.g., via host immune-neural connections). Even when the change in host behaviour results in clear fitness benefits for the parasite, these behavioural changes may sometimes be produced by the host. Changes in host behaviour that decrease the fitness costs of infection could be selected for, even if these changes also benefit the parasite.

In addition, we will briefly summarize the pathophysiology of SAH in the setting of CVT. Methods: We reviewed 16 articles, which included 26 different case reports of SAH associated with CVT. In addition, we presented our experience with a case of SAH secondary to CVT. Results: Nonenhanced CT was able to detect SAH in 86% of cases and CVT in only 36%. Further imaging testing was necessary to further characterize the extent of the thrombosis. The location of the SAH varied, but it never involved the skull base. Risk factors for CVT development included hypercoagulable states, oral contraceptives use, history of recent fracture or surgery, family or personal history of deep vein thrombosis, smoking, and hyperlipidemia and migraines. Sixty-two percent of patients had acute onset severe headaches, 35% presented with nuchal rigidity, and 35% presented with seizures. Conclusions: Cerebral venous thrombosis must be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with a broad range of neurological presentations especially in the presence of new onset of seizures. Computed tomographic offers many clues to the diagnosis of CVT when concomitant SAH is present. These include the presence of SAH at cerebral convexities with associated basal cisterns and skull base sparing. Recognition of these subtleties will allow prompt and appropriate management and, when in doubt, encourage further investigations. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Psychostimulant Treatment and the Developing Cortex in Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY			English	Article							DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; DEVELOPMENTAL TRAJECTORIES; CORTICAL THICKNESS; ACTIVITY LEVEL; MOTOR-ACTIVITY; MRI DATA; METHYLPHENIDATE; CHILDREN; ADOLESCENTS; ADHD	Objective: While there has been considerable concern over possible adverse effects of psychostimulants on brain development, this issue has not been examined in a prospective study. The authors sought to determine prospectively whether psychostimulant treatment for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) was associated with differences in the development of the cerebral cortex during adolescence. Method: Change in cortical thickness was estimated from two neuroanatomic MRI scans in 43 youths with ADHD. The mean age at the first scan was 12.5 years, and at the second scan, 16.4 years. Nineteen patients not treated with psychostimulants between the scans were compared with an age-matched group of 24 patients who were treated with psychostimulants. Further comparison was made against a template derived from 620 scans of 294 typically developing youths without ADHD. Results: Adolescents taking psychostimulants differed from those not taking psychostimulants in the rate of change of the cortical thickness in the right motor strip, the left middle/inferior frontal gyrus, and the right parieto-occipital region. The group difference was due to more rapid cortical thinning in the group not taking psychostimulants (mean cortical thinning of 0.16 mm/year [SD=0.17], compared with 0.03 mm/year [SD=0.11] in the group taking psychostimulants). Comparison against the typically developing cohort without ADHD showed that cortical thinning in the group not taking psychostimulants was in excess of age-appropriate rates. The treatment groups did not differ in clinical outcome, however. Conclusions: These findings show no evidence that psychostimulants were associated with slowing of overall growth of the cortical mantle.

Thirty-eight ALS patients, nine PLS patients, and 22 healthy controls were enrolled. cMRI, MTI, DWI and (1)H-MRSI were obtained. ALS patients were classified as advanced phase (Ap)-ALS (definite + probable) and early phase (Ep)-ALS (possible + probable-laboratory supported). cMRI was highly sensitive in detecting corticospinal tract (CST) hyperintensities in Ap-ALS (63.4%) and PLS (71.9%), but it was poorly sensitive in Ep-ALS (17.1%). Hyperintensity on proton density-weighted images correlated with ALS severity (p = 0.02). CST apparent diffusion coefficient was significantly increased in ALS (p < 0.01) and PLS (p = 0.02) versus controls. The N-acetylaspartate/ creatine ratio was significantly reduced in the motor cortex of patients versus controls(p <= 0.01 in PLS, p = 0.02 in Ap-ALS). The study shows the utility of cMRI for diagnosing ALS. Nevertheless, MRI sensitivity is limited at the early stages of the disease. In these cases, DWI and (1)H-MRSI seem to have the potential to ameliorate the patients' work-up and estimate the nature and extent of the underlying pathological damage.

Modeling the Gabaergic Action of Etomidate on the Thalamocortical System	ANESTHESIA AND ANALGESIA			English	Article							HIPPOCAMPAL-NEURONS; ANESTHESIA; PROPOFOL; CONSCIOUSNESS; RECEPTORS; HUMANS; INHIBITION; METABOLISM; DEPRESSION; INDUCTION	BACKGROUND: We have used a computational model of the thalamocortical system to investigate the effects of a GABAergic anesthetic (etomidate) on cerebral cortical and thalamic neuronal function. We examined the effects of phasic an tonic inhibition, as well as the relative importance of anesthetic action in the thalamus and cortex. METHODS: The amount of phasic GABAergic inhibition was adjusted in the model to simulate etomidate concentrations of between 0.25 and 2 mu M, with the concentration range producing unconsciousness assumed to be between 0.25 and 0.5 mu M. In addition, we modeled tonic inhibition separately, and then phasic and tonic inhibition together. We also introduced phasic and tonic inhibition into the cerebral cortex and thalamus separately to determine the relative importance of each of these structure,., to anesthetic-induced depression of the thalamocortical system. RESULTS: Phasic inhibition decreased cortical neuronal firing by 1 in the 0.25-0.5 mu M range and by 38% at 2 mu M. Tonic inhibition produced similar depression (11%-21%) in the 0.25-0.5 mu M range but 65% depression at 2 mu M; phasic and tonic inhibition combined produced the most inhibition (76%) depression at 2 mu M). When the thalamus and cortex were separately subjected to phasic and tonic inhibition, cortical firing rates decreased less compared to when both structures were targeted. In the 0.25-0.5 mu M range, cortical firing rate was minimally affected when etomidate action was simulated in the thalamus Only. CONCLUSIONS: This computational model of the thalamocortical system indicated that tonic GABAergic inhibition seems to be more important than phasic GABAergic inhibition (especially at larger etomidate concentrations), although both combined had the most effect on cerebral cortical firing rates. Furthermore, etomidate action in the thalamus, by itself, does not likely explain etomidate-induced unconsciousness.

METHODS: Non-response questionnaires (NRQ) were completed by a sub-set of nonparticipants. Selection bias factors were calculated based on the prevalence of mobile phone use reported by nonparticipants with NRQ data, and on scenarios of hypothetical exposure prevalence for other nonparticipants. RESULTS: Regular mobile phone use was reported less frequently by controls and cases who completed the NRQ (controls, 56%; cases, 50%) than by those who completed the full interview (controls, 69%; cases, 66%). This relationship was consistent across study centers, sex, and age groups. Lower education and more recent start of mobile phone use were associated with refusal to participate. Bias factors varied between 0.87 and 0.92 in the most plausible scenarios. CONCLUSIONS: Refusal to participate in brain tumor case-control studies seems to be related to less prevalent use of mobile phones, and this could result in a downward bias of around 10% in odds ratios for regular mobile phone use. The use of simple selection bias estimation methods in case-control studies can give important insights into the extent of any bias, even when nonparticipant information is incomplete.

However, current health condition prediction approaches are not accurate enough, which has become the bottleneck for achieving the full power of CBM. In this work, we develop a recurrent neural network approach for equipment health condition prediction. The effectiveness of the approach is illustrated using data collected from a lab gearbox experimental system.

One of the most commonly used neural networks, namely the multilayer perceptrons (MLP) could sometimes fail to model highly nonlinear input-output behaviors accurately. Advanced neural networks (e.g. knowledge based neural networks) can be employed; however, such networks suffer from an increased complexity both in terms of their structures and training methods. In this paper, we propose a neural network modeling approach based on a novel correction model concept. This approach helps accurately model complicated behaviors using simple 3-layer MLP networks. Both active and passive examples are presented.

A truncated variant of the tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB. T1) is expressed in astrocytes, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor-TrkB signaling has been linked to mood disorders. Objective: To test the hypothesis that TrkB. T1 expression is downregulated in suicide completers and that this downregulation is mediated by an epigenetic process. Design: Postmortem case-control study. Patients, Setting, and Main Outcome Measures: Thirty-nine French Canadian men underwent screening at the Douglas Hospital Research Institute using the HG-U133 plus 2 microarray chip. Nine frontal cortical regions and the cerebellum were assessed using a microarray screening approach for extreme expression differences across subjects and a conventional screening approach. Results were validated by quantitative polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analyses. Animal experiments were performed to control for drug and alcohol effects. Genetic and epigenetic studies were performed by means of direct sequencing and bisulfite mapping. Results: We found that 10 of 28 suicide completers (36%) demonstrated significant decreases in different probe sets specific to TrkB. T1 in Brodmann areas 8 and 9. These findings were generalizable to other frontal regions but not to the cerebellum. The decrease in TrkB expression was specific to the T1 splice variant. Our results were not accounted for by substance comorbidity or by reduction in astrocyte number. We found no effect of genetic variation in a 2500-base pair promoter region or at relevant splice junctions; however, we detected an effect of methylation state at particular CpG dinucleotides on TrkB. T1 expression. Conclusion: A reduction of TrkB. T1 expression in the frontal cortex of a subpopulation of suicide completers is associated with the methylation state of the promoter region.

Design: Cohort study. Setting: Columbia University Medical Center. Participants: A cohort of 123 matrilineal relatives from 45 families, including 45 fully symptomatic patients with mitochondrial myopathy, encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes ( syndrome), 78 carrier relatives, and 30 controls. Main Outcome Measures: Data gathered from standardized medical history questionnaires, neurological and ophthalmological examination forms, and laboratory tests. We compared data between 3 groups. Results: Mutation carriers' clinical and laboratory results frequently had many abnormalities. In addition to neurological symptoms, they often had cardiac, endocrine, gastrointestinal, and psychiatric symptoms. Conclusions: The A3243G mutation carriers have multiple medical problems, suggesting that the A3243G mutation should be considered as an etiological factor in patients with multisystem clinical presentations or a family history compatible with matrilineal inheritance. Because some medical problems affecting A3243G mutation carriers are treatable, early detection and proactive management may mitigate the burden of morbidity.

However, an attitude with no stress at all can cause the same thing as stress can be beneficial in some learning cases. Studying the stress level variation can then be very useful in a learning environment. In this paper, the aim is predicting the stress level variation of the learner in relation to his electrical brain activity within an experiment over two days. To attain that goal, three personal and non-personal characteristics were used: gender, usual mode of study and dominant activity between the first and second day. 21 participants were recruited for our experiment. Results were very encouraging: an accuracy of 71% was obtained by using the ID3 machine learning algorithm.

Dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra and ventral tegmental area provide early input to the embryonic neostriatum and may play an important role in neostriatal motphogenesis. Our group and others have demonstrated early loss of dopaminergic neurons in the Pitx3-deficient aphakia mouse, associated with a >90% reduction in neostriatal dopamine levels and a hypokinetic movement disorder. Here, we show scant or absent dopaminergic fibers in the adult aphakia dorsolateral and medial neostriatum, altering the chemical anatomy of mu-opioid receptor stained patches. Furthermore, neostriatal neuron numbers are comparable in aphakia and wild-type animals, but the volume of the aphakia neostriatum and its neurons is significantly reduced. We propose that early nigrostriatal dopaminergic loss in aphakia mice results in loss of trophic support to the developing neostriatum.

The ability to distinguish sensory inputs that are a consequence of our own actions (vestibular reafference) from those that result from changes in the external world (vestibular exafference) is essential for perceptual stability and accurate motor control. Recent work in our laboratory has focused on understanding how the brain distinguishes between vestibular reafference and exafference. Single-unit recordings were made in alert rhesus monkeys during passive and voluntary (i.e., active) head movements. We found that neurons in the first central stage of vestibular processing (vestibular nuclei), but not the primary vestibular afferents, can distinguish between active and passive movements. In order to better understand how neurons differentiate active from passive head motion, we systematically tested neuronal responses to different combinations of passive and active motion resulting from rotation of the head-on-body and/or head-and-body in space. We found that during active movements, a cancellation signal was generated when the activation of proprioceptors matched the motor-generated expectation.

If other individuals are nearby, they may adopt the innovation, thus spreading it through the population. Much research has focused on this social transmission of behaviour, but the effect of social context on the emergence of novel behaviour is unclear. Here, we examine the effect of social context on innovative feeding behaviour in the Carib grackle (Quiscalus lugubris), an opportunistic, gregarious bird. We test the effect of the proximity of conspecifics, while eliminating the direct effects of interference, scrounging, or aggression. Using a repeated-measures design, we found that birds took significantly longer to contact novel foraging tasks when in the presence of others vs. alone, and during playbacks of alarm calls vs. a control sound. Further, performance of a food-processing behaviour decreased when birds were with others, and individuals adjusted their behaviour depending on their distance from conspecifics. Our results suggest that feeding in groups may slow down or inhibit innovative foraging behaviour in this species. We discuss the implications of a trade-off between feeding in groups and taking advantage of new feeding opportunities.

BIOLOGICAL FOUNDATIONS AND ORIGIN OF SYNTAX	Strungmann Forum Reports		English	Proceedings Paper	Ernst Strungmann Forum	JUL 13-18, 2008	Frankfurt, GERMANY					This chapter summarizes the extensive discussions of the working group whose mandate was to review the major syntactic phenomena that require an explanation as part of the evolved biological capacities of human beings. The main building blocks of syntax are outlined, starting with lexical categories and functional categories. Hierarchical structure and recursion are examined, particularly in light of proposals that recursion is the only uniquely human characteristic in the language faculty. A typology of dependencies between syntactic elements is discussed and the relationship between such dependencies and the needs of the human parser is considered. Syntactic universals of various kinds are outlined, their treatment within different grammatical traditions is examined, and possible responses to exceptional constructions are considered. Some evidence is presented in favor of abstract, high-level grammatical principles. Finally, using examples from the development of creoles from pidgins, from the diachronic processes involved in language change, and from the ontogenetic development of language in infants, consideration is given as to whether evidence of the (unobservable) evolution of syntax itself can be gathered from an examination of different kinds of observable syntactic phenomena.

The study is similar to a faux clinical trial and has been established to assess longitudinal MRI changes in AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and healthy control subjects using an image acquisition protocol compatible with the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). The approach consists of a harmonized MRI acquisition protocol across centers, rigorous quality control, a central data analysis hub, and an automated image analysis pipeline. Comprehensive quality control measures have been established throughout the study. An intelligent web-accessible database holds details on both the raw images and data processed using a sophisticated image analysis pipeline. A total of 378 subjects were recruited (130 AD, 131 MCI, 117 healthy controls) of which a high percentage (97.3%) of the T1-weighted volumes passed the quality control criteria. Measurements of normalized whole brain volume, whole brain cortical thickness, and point-by-point group-based cortical thickness measurements, demonstrating the power of the automated image analysis techniques employed, are reported.

SD patients often present with surface dyslexia, a relatively selective impairment in reading low-frequency words with exceptional or atypical spelling-to-sound correspondences. Exception words are typically over-regularized in SD and pronounced as they are spelled (e.g. sew is pronounced as sue). This suggests that in the absence of sufficient item-specific knowledge, exception words are read by relying mainly on subword processes for regular mapping of orthography to phonology. In this study, we investigated the functional anatomy of surface dyslexia in SD using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and studied its relationship to structural damage with voxel-based morphometry (VBM). Five SD patients and nine healthy age-matched controls were scanned while they read regular words, exception words and pseudowords in an event-related design. Vocal responses were recorded and revealed that all patients were impaired in reading low-frequency exception words, and made frequent over-regularization errors. Consistent with prior studies, fMRI data revealed that both groups activated a similar basic network of bilateral occipital, motor and premotor regions for reading single words. VBM showed that these regions were not significantly atrophied in SD. In control subjects, a region in the left intraparietal sulcus was activated for reading pseudowords and low-frequency regular words but not exception words, suggesting a role for this area in subword mapping from orthographic to phonological representations. In SD patients only, this inferior parietal region, which was not atrophied, was also activated by reading low-frequency exception words, especially on trials where over-regularization errors occurred. These results suggest that the left intraparietal sulcus is involved in subword reading processes that are differentially recruited in SD when word-specific information is lost. This loss is likely related to degeneration of the anterior temporal lobe, which was severely atrophied in SD. Consistent with this, left mid-fusiform and superior temporal regions that showed reading-related activations in controls were not activated in SD. Taken together, these results suggest that the left inferior parietal region subserves subword orthographic-to-phonological processes that are recruited for exception word reading when retrieval of exceptional, item-specific word forms is impaired by degeneration of the anterior temporal lobe.

We briefly review the members of the PKC and PKA family and focus on the evolution of the immediate upstream activators of PKC and PKA i.e., phospholipase C (PLC) and adenylyl cyclase (AC), and their conservation in gastropod mollusks, taking advantage of the recent assembly of the Aplysia californica and Lottia gigantea genomes. The diversity of PLC and AC family members present in mollusks suggests a multitude of possible mechanisms to activate PKA and PKC; we briefly discuss the relevance of these pathways to the known physiological activation of these kinases in Aplysia neurons during plasticity and learning. These multiple mechanisms of activation provide the gastropod nervous system with tremendous flexibility for implementing neuromodulatory responses to both neuronal activity and extracellular signals.

Research design/methods: A verbal memory paradigm manipulating attentional load (full attention or divided attention) and semantic congruency between pairs of category-target words during encoding was administrated to 13 individuals with MTBI and 12 normal control participants. Environmental supports during retrieval (free recall, cued recall and recognition modes) were also manipulated. Main outcomes and results: Results show that recall performances of individuals with MTBI were similar to those of controls when words were encoded under full attention. In contrast, individuals with MTBI performed worse than control participants when encoding under divided attention, whatever the semantic link between pairs of words. Conclusions: By using a sensitive test, one was able to objectively measure subtle impairments in memory performance, suggesting a diminished availability of attentional resources after MTBI. Young adults' learning of verbal material under divided attention might be compromised by the reduction of cognitive resources following MTBI. These findings are also discussed in light of different factors that can influence cognitive performance.

This study hypothesized the presence of correlations between classical tests of EF and the IADL Profile, as the latter aims to establish whether the subject's main difficulties pertain to goal formulation, planning, carrying out the task and/or attaining the initial task goal; all important components of EF. Methods and procedures: One hundred subjects with a moderate/severe TBI aged 16-65 years (convenience sample) were recruited. Subjects were tested with the IADL Profile and three measures of EF within their home environment. Data was analysed using Pearson correlations, t-tests and multiple stepwise regressions. Results: Post-traumatic amnesia and working memory emerged as the major determinants of IADL Profile scores. Together, indices of injury severity, measures of EF, education, age and environmental factors accounted for 12-28% of the variance in IADL Profile scores. Conclusions: This study has shown that the IADL Profile's non-structured approach permits the observation of a broad range of behaviours related to EF deficits and thus provides a closer approximation of the person's independence in IADL. Further study is required to demonstrate the IADL Profile's ability to inform more targeted treatment interventions.

Alterations to locomotor navigation in a complex environment at 7 and 30 days following a concussion in an elite athlete	BRAIN INJURY			English	Article						Attention; locomotion; multi-tasking; executive functioning; mild traumatic brain injury; sport	TRAUMATIC BRAIN-INJURY; NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL TEST-PERFORMANCE; COLLEGIATE FOOTBALL PLAYERS; SPORTS-RELATED CONCUSSION; POSTURAL STABILITY; NCAA CONCUSSION; ATTENTION; GAIT; RECOVERY; DEFICITS	Primary objective: To compare the locomotor capacity during (1) unobstructed walking and (2) the circumvention of fixed obstacles with and without a simultaneous visual task in an elite athlete before and after a sports-related concussion. Research design: Case report. Methods and procedures: Gait analysis and clinical neuropsychological measures were taken pre- and at 7 and 30 days post-injury in an 18 year old male junior hockey player. The task consisted of walking along an unobstructed or obstructed path with or without a visual interference task. Measurements included dual tasks costs, response errors, maximal gait speed and minimal clearance with the obstacle. Main outcome and results: Although the athlete was symptom-free and neuropsychological test results returned to baseline relatively quickly, he showed continued errors in the interference task, abnormally small obstacle clearance distances and decreased maximal gait speed up to 30 days after the concussion. Conclusions: Concussion can result in persistent planning and attention deficits in ecologically valid, complex environments. This report suggests that functional assessment within an ecological context could be an innovative way to evaluate concussed athletes before sending them back to play, even in the absence of medically related symptoms or abnormal neuropsychological test results.

However, there is no clear description of the human assistance used by this population in relation with specific life habits (LH). Objectives: (1) to describe the proportion of LH performed with human assistance; (2) to explore the characteristics of TBI persons with greater needs for human assistance; (3) to clarify the categories of LH for which persons with TBI need human assistance; and (4) to determine the relationship between the human helper and the person with TBI across different residential settings. Method: One hundred and thirty-six individuals with moderate or severe TBI were interviewed using the LIFE-H. Results: Human assistance is used to perform one out of three LH. A greater need for human assistance was associated with the number of impairments, motor limitation to the upper limbs, hemiplegia and receiving public insurance. Human assistance was used more often to perform LH pertaining to social roles than those pertaining to daily living. Close relatives were the most frequent providers of human assistance regardless of the residential setting. Conclusion: Given the importance of human assistance in TBI, it is essential to support human helpers during and after rehabilitation.

Methods and procedure: Sixty persons with mild, moderate and severe TBI admitted to the intensive care unit were part of this retrospective study. Main outcomes: Duration of PTA, length of stay (LOS), Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS-E) score, the FIM dagger score as well as early neuropsychological outcome measured by the Neurobehavioural Rating Scale Revised (NBRS-R). Results: 2-factor ANOVAs and chi-squares tests showed that PTA and LOS were significantly longer in the group of patients with pre-injury alcohol abuse, regardless of whether they were intoxicated or not at the time of injury. Moreover, the FIM total and cognitive scores were significantly higher for the group intoxicated on admission compared to the sober group. However, GOS-E scores and results on the NBRS-R were similar. Conclusions: Despite a longer PTA and LOS, global and neurobehavioural outcomes at discharge from acute care were not different for those with pre-injury alcohol abuse.

Method: Participants for this study were recruited from college football teams. They included athletes who never sustained concussions compared to two groups of asymptomatic multiple concussed athletes, one that sustained their last concussion within the year and the other more than 2 years prior to testing. All participants were submitted to an auditory three-tone Oddball paradigm while event-related potentials (ERP) were recorded. Results: Results from ERP recordings reveal significantly reduced P3a and P3b amplitudes in the recent concussed group in the three-tone task compared to control athletes. In contrast, athletes who sustained their concussions more than 2 years prior to testing had equivalent P3a and P3b amplitude to that of controls. Conclusion: These findings suggest that, despite functioning normally in their daily lives, concussed athletes still show subtle neuronal changes in information processing. Thus, the persistence of sub-clinical abnormalities on ERP components despite normal overt functioning may indicate sub-optimal compensation in multiple concussed athletes and leave them vulnerable to subsequent concussions.

Research design: The article describes the underlying principles and the development of specific interventions for a new rehabilitation programme as well as preliminary data on pre- and post-rehabilitation changes in outcome measures. Methods and procedures: Development of the intervention was done using multiple perspectives including that of the literature, of experts in the field of traumatic brain injury and of experienced clinicians involved with the paediatric and adolescent MTBI clientele. A logic model was developed providing sound theoretical background to the intervention. The intervention was implemented and evaluated with a sample of 16 children and adolescents. Main outcomes and results: The presented cases suggest that involvement in controlled and closely monitored rehabilitation in the post-acute period may promote recovery in children and adolescents who present with atypical recovery following a concussion. All 16 of the children and adolescents who participated in the programme experienced a relatively rapid recovery and returned to their normal lifestyles and sport participation. Conclusions: A gradual, closely-supervised active rehabilitation programme in the post-acute period (i.e. after 1 month post-injury) appears promising to improve the care provided to children who are slow to recover.

The aim of this Study is to provide variations in the drainage patterns of SAVs depending on the intraoperative findings. Methods: A total of 25 1 craniotomies due to intractable temporal lobe epilepsy were performed between 1972 and 1987 at the Montreal Neurological Institute. The courses of the three largest SAVs including the vein of Trolard (VT), vein of Labbe (VL) and Superficial Sylvian vein (SSV) were Studied. Results: All three veins showed variable Courses. The most common predominant vein was the combination of the VL + SSV. The VT and VL were frequently coursed at the level of the central vein and middle temporal vein, respectively. On the right hemisphere the SSV was the predominant type while the VL tended to be predominant oil the left hemisphere. A combination of VL and SSV was predominant in patients with right and/or left hemispheric dominance. Conclusions: The SAVs showed considerable variation in their courses and it is difficult to define an exact pattern although some courses showed constant directions. Attention should be paid not to damage these veins since in a considerable number of cases it single dominant vein may be responsible for draining, a majority of the lateral surface of cerebral hemisphere.

Brown Norway rats show impaired nNOS-mediated information transfer in renal autoregulation	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY AND PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Symposium on Information Transfer in the Microcirculation held at the 2008 Winter Meeting of the Canadian-Physiological-Society	JAN 26, 2008	Lake Louise, CANADA	Canadian Physiol Soc		blood pressure; NOS isoforms; kidney; renal blood flow dynamics	NITRIC-OXIDE SYNTHASE; BLOOD-FLOW AUTOREGULATION; MYOGENIC AUTOREGULATION; HYPERTENSIVE-RATS; TUBULOGLOMERULAR FEEDBACK; KIDNEY; PRESSURE; VASODILATION; VASOPRESSIN	Nonselective inhibition of NO synthase (NOS) augments myogenic autoregulation of renal blood flow (RBF) and profoundly reduces RBF. Previously in Wistar rats, we showed that augmented autoregulation, but not vasoconstriction, is duplicated by intrarenal inhibition of neuronal NOS (nNOS), whereas intrarenal inhibition of inducible NOS (iNOS) has no effect on RBF or on RBF dynamics. Thus macula densa nNOS transfers information from tubuloglomerular feedback to the afferent arteriole. This information flow requires that macula densa nNOS can sufficiently alter ambient NO concentration, that is, that endothelial NOS (eNOS) and iNOS do not alter local NO concentration. Because the Brown Norway rat often shows exaggerated responses to NOS inhibition and has peculiarities of renal autoregulation that are related to NO, we used this strain to study systemic and renal vascular responses to NOS inhibition. The first experiment showed transient blood pressure reduction by bolus i.v. acetylcholine that was dose-dependent in both strains and substantially prolonged in Brown Norway rats. The depressor response decayed more rapidly after nonselective NOS inhibition and the difference between strains was lost, indicating a greater activity of eNOS in Brown Norway rats. In Brown Norway rats, selective inhibition of iNOS reduced RBF (-16% +/- 7%) and augmented myogenic autoregulation, whereas nNOS inhibition reduced RBF (-25% +/- 4%) and did not augment myogenic autoregulation. The significant responses to intrarenal iNOS inhibition, the reduced modulation of autoregulation by nNOS inhibition, and the enhanced endothelial depressor response suggest that physiological signalling by NO within the kidney is impaired in Brown Norway rats because of irrelevant or inappropriate input of NO by eNOS and iNOS.

The goal of this review is to, first, summarize results from these studies from a perspective of task design and, second, assess the appropriateness of the different stress tasks used. Method: We completed a PubMed search on recent articles that have examined the effects of psychological stress on neural processes in a neuroimaging environment. Selected articles were arranged according to the stress task used in the following categories: script-driven stress stimuli, Stroop colour-word interference task, speech in front of an audience, serial subtraction, and Montreal Imaging Stress Task (MIST). Results: Only studies using serial subtraction or the MIST were able to induce a significant cortisol stress response in their participants. Most consistent findings include decreased activity in orbitofrontal regions in response to stress. Additional findings of note are increases in activity in the frontal lobes, particularly the anterior cingulate cortex, as well as deactivation of the limbic system, particularly the hippocampus. Conclusion: Research to date is beginning to outline the involvement of prefrontal and limbic regions in perception and modulation of psychological stress. However, additional research is needed in designing a neuroimaging stress task that will yield a significant cortisol stress response consistently, across populations and laboratories.

In the present study, 27 healthy older adults and 30 persons with MCI completed questionnaires covering psychological health, morale, personality, self-efficacy, and self-actualization. The results indicated that individuals with MCI are more depressed, anxious, hostile, and have lower morale than matched healthy older adults. Furthermore, our results show a positive association between the level of depression of MCI persons and the severity of their cognitive dysfunctions. In contrast, there were no group differences on measures of personality traits. Thus, while psychological distress is present in persons with MCI, those individuals are not characterized by differences in personality traits relative to older adults who experience no cognitive impairment.

We investigated whether single and binary odor mixtures activate different regions also in the human brain. We analyzed data from positron emission tomography scans using pyridine, citral, and 5 mixtures of pyridine and citral in proportions varying from 10/90 to 90/10, with 50/50 being the most impure. Comparing mixtures with single odorants gave activation in the left cingulate and right parietal and superior frontal cortices and bilateral activation in the anterior and lateral orbitofrontal cortices. We also found that brain activity in the lateral orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) increased with odorant impurity, whereas the anterior OFC was activated for binary odor mixtures and deactivated for single components. We conclude that binary odor mixtures and their individual components are processed differently by the human brain. The lateral portion of the OFC responds to mixture impurity in a graded fashion, whereas the anterior portion acts like an on-off detector of odor mixtures.

Methods: We performed a retrospective chart review of 553 consecutive acute ischemic stroke patients presenting to the Montreal General Hospital between April 1st 2002 and October 15th 2005. We defined a severe stroke as a Canadian Neurological Scale score of <= 7 and a poor early outcome as a modified Rankin Scale score of 1 3 at 10 days post-stroke. Results: In total, 339 patients were included. Superior early functional outcome was associated with the premorbid use of statins (OR = 0.50, 95% CI: 0.25-1.00) and the combination of all 3 medications (OR = 0.37, 95% CI: 0.16-0.87). Angiotensin-II-decreasing agents were associated with an increased risk of severe strokes (OR = 2.13, 95% CI: 1.00-4.52). Conclusions: Pre-stroke use of statins and the combination of antihypertensives, antiplatelets, and statins were both associated with a favorable functional outcome at 10 days post-stroke. Angiotensin-II-decreasing agents were associated with increased initial stroke severity. Copyright (C) 2009 S. Karger AG, Basel	[Yu, Amy Y.

This study compares the evolution of burden of two groups of caregivers of people with a recent stroke who returned home after discharge from two different types of health care facilities. Methods: Burden was assessed at 3 weeks and 3 and 6 months after discharge. The two groups of people with stroke and their caregivers were recruited from acute care (n = 69) and rehabilitation facilities (n = 89). Caregivers completed a questionnaire with three dimensions. In addition to sociodemographic characteristics, we assessed variables pertaining to the clinical, physical and cognitive functioning of the people with stroke. Results: Differences in burden were noted. The best predictors of burden were the caregivers' characteristics, i.e. gender (female), occupation (retired), schooling (low), age (older) and hours of care given, and the stroke survivors' characteristics, i.e. depressive symptoms, poor motor function (leg), verbal comprehension deficits, difficulty walking and neurological deficits. Conclusion: These results reinforce the view that services (information, training and support) should be tailored to the needs of caregivers, depending on whether or not the recipient of care has received rehabilitation services.

The multidrug resistance (MDR) phenotype can be mediated by the superfamily of adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette (ABC) transporters. The dynamics of expression of the MDR genes after exposure to chemotherapy, especially the comparison between pediatric brain tumors of different histology, is poorly described. To compare the expression profiles of the multidrug resistance genes ABCB1, ABCC1, and ABCG2 in different neuroepithelial pediatric brain tumor cell lines prior and following short-term culture with vinblastine. Immortalized lineages from pilocytic astrocytoma (R286), anaplasic astrocytoma (UW467), glioblastoma (SF188), and medulloblastoma (UW3) were exposed to vinblastine sulphate at different schedules (10 and 60 nM for 24 and 72 h). Relative amounts of mRNA expression were analyzed by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Protein expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry for ABCB1, ABCC1, and ABCG2. mRNA expression of ABCB1 increased together with augmenting concentration and time of exposure to vinblastine for R286, UW467, and UW3 cell lines. Interestingly, ABCB1 levels of expression diminished in SF188. Following chemotherapy, mRNA expression of ABCC1 decreased in all cell lines other than glioblastoma. ABCG2 expression was influenced by vinblastine only for UW3. The mRNA levels showed consistent association to protein expression in the selected sets of cell lines analyzed. The pediatric glioblastoma cell line SF188 shows different pattern of expression of multidrug resistance genes when exposed to vinblastine. These preliminary findings may be useful in determining novel strategies of treatment for neuroepithelial pediatric brain tumors.

These endogenous circadian rhythms are generated by intracellular timing mechanisms termed circadian clocks. In mammals, the master clock is located in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN), but other brain regions and most peripheral tissues contain circadian clocks. These clocks are responsive to environmental cues, in particular light/dark and feeding/fasting cycles. In the last few years, tissue-specific knock-out and transgenic mouse models have helped to define the physiological roles of specific clocks. Recent reports indicate that the clock-physiology connection is bi-directional, and physiological cues, in particular the energetic status of the cell, can feed into the clockwork. This effect was discovered unexpectedly in molecular analyses of clock protein modifications. Beyond the positive and negative transcription/translation feedback loops of the molecular oscillator lies another level of complexity. Post-translational modifications of clock proteins are both critical for the timing of the clock feedback mechanism and to provide regulatory fine-tuning. This review summarizes recent advances in our understanding of the roles of peripheral clocks and of post-translational modifications occurring on clock proteins. These two matters are at the intersection of physiology, metabolism, and the circadian system.

Recent data indicate that lacosamide (a compound with analgesic and anticonvulsant effects in animal models) shares a similar mechanism. When compared with other AEDs, lacosamide has the unique ability to interact with sodium channel slow inactivation without affecting fast inactivation. This article reviews these findings and discusses their relevance within the context of neuronal activity seen during epileptiform, discharges generated by limbic neuronal networks in the presence of chemical convulsants. These seizure-like events are characterized by sustained discharges of sodium-dependent action potentials supported by robust depolarizations, thus providing synchronization within neuronal networks. Generally, AEDs such as phenytoin, carbamazepine and lamotrigine block sodium channels when activated. In contrast, lacosamide facilitates slow inactivation of sodium channels both in terms of kinetics and voltage dependency. This effect may be relatively selective for repeatedly depolarized neurons, such as those participating in seizure activity in which the persistence of sodium currents is more pronounced and promotes neuronal excitation. The clinical effectiveness of lacosamide has been demonstrated in randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-con trol led, adjunctive-therapy trials in patients with refractory partial seizures. Further studies should determine whether the effects of lacosamide in animal models and in clinical settings are fully explained by its selective action on sodium current slow inactivation or whether other effects (e.g. interactions with the collapsin-response mediator protein-2) play a contributory role.

For example, we have shown that resveratrol, a polyphenol enriched in red wine and other foods such as peanuts, protects hippocampal cells against beta-amyloid (A beta)-induced toxicity, a key protein involved in the neuropathology of Alzheimer disease. This effect involves, at least in part, the capacity of resveratrol to activate the phosphorylation of delta isoform of protein kinase C (PKC-delta). The neuroprotective action of resveratrol is shared by piceatannol, a stilbene derivative, as well as by tea-derived catechin gallate esters. The thioflavin T assay indicated that all these polyphenols inhibited the formation of A beta fibrils, suggesting that this action likely also contributes to their neuroprotective effects. Binding and autoradiographic studies revealed that the effects of polyphenols might involve specific binding sites that are particularly enriched in the choroid plexus in the rat brain. Interestingly, the choroid plexus secretes transthyretin, a protein that has been shown to modulate A beta aggregation and that may be critical to the maintenance of normal learning capacities in aging. Taken together, these data suggest that polyphenols target multiple enzymes/proteins, leading to their neuroprotective actions, possibly through action via specific plasma membrane binding sites.

This was tested in normal individuals and in I.R., a brain-damaged patient with a phonological deficit. In Experiment 1, the effect of phonological and semantic similarity was assessed under different presentation formats (words, pictures) and recall modes (oral, picture pointing, and picture pointing among distractors). In Experiment 2, effects were compared using reproduction and reconstruction responses. When words were used at input, controls showed robust phonological similarity effects irrespective of response mode. In contrast, I.R. showed a reliable semantic effect. However, both studies indicated that when response mode promoted order recuperation (reconstruction and picture pointing modes), I.R. showed a typical phonological similarity effect with no semantic contribution. The data support current psycholinguistic views suggesting that the short-term retention of verbal items depends on the temporary activation of word representations. In healthy controls, presentation mode appears to modulate the role of those representations but in I.R., it was the output conditionparticularly whether order was or was not requiredthat was found to be crucial with respect to the appearance of semantic or phonological effects. This supports the important role that order information plays in short-term memory tasks.

A series of clinical and pathological observations suggest that NMO-IgG may play a central role in NMO physiopathology. Although the exact role and function of NMO-IgG in vivo remain to be determined, recent reports suggest that this antibody that targets the aquaporin-4 (AQP-4) water channel expressed by astrocytes is able to destabilize the blood-brain barrier and contribute to astrocyte and oligodendrocyte damage. This review summarizes the latest molecular effector functions attributed to the NMO-IgG/anti-AQP4 antibody and discusses their potential role in NMO pathology.

An early, colonialist literature attributed cultural characteristics and variations in psychopathology and behavior to deficiencies in the brains of colonized peoples. Contemporary research in social and cultural neuroscience holds the promise of moving beyond these invidious comparisons to a more sophisticated understanding of cultural variations in brain function relevant to psychiatry. To achieve this, however, we need better models of the nature of psychopathology and of culture itself. Culture is not simply a set of traits or characteristics shared by people with a common geographic, historical, or ethnic background. Current anthropology understands culture as fluid, flexible systems of discourse, institutions, and practices, which individuals actively use for self-fashioning and social positioning. Globalization introduces new cultural dynamics and demands that we rethink culture in relation to a wider domain of evolving identities, knowledge, and practice. Psychopathology is not reducible to brain dysfunction in either its causes, mechanisms, or expression. In addition to neuropsychiatric disorders, the problems that people bring to psychiatrists may result from disorders in cognition, the personal and social meanings of experience, and the dynamics of interpersonal interactions or social systems and institutions. The shifting meanings of culture and psychopathology have implications for efforts to apply cultural neuroscience to psychiatry. We consider how cultural neuroscience can refine use of culture and its role in psychopathology using the example of adolescent aggression as a symptom of conduct disorder.

It would be advantageous to be able to distinguish the characteristics of those MCI patients with a high probability to progress to AD if one wishes to monitor the disease development and treatment. Methods: We assessed the baseline MRI and maximum of 7 years clinical follow-up data of 60 MCI subjects in order to examine differences in cortical thickness (CTH) between the progressive MCI (P-MCI) and stable MCI (S-MCI) subjects. CTH was measured using an automatic computational surface-based method. During the follow-up, 15 MCI subjects converted to AD on average 1.9 8 +/- 1.3 years after the baseline examination, while 45 MCI subjects remained stable. Results: The P-MCI group displayed significantly reduced CTH bilaterally in the superior and middle frontal, superior, middle and inferior temporal, fusiform and parahippocampal regions as well as the cingulate and retrosplenial cortices and also in the right precuneal and paracentral regions compared to S-MCI subjects. Conclusions: Analysis of CTH could be used in conjunction with neuropsychological testing to identify those subjects with imminent conversion from MCI to AD several years before dementia diagnosis.

Two main clinical subtypes of aMCI have been identified: ( 1) single-domain aMCI (aMCI-SD), with isolated episodic memory impairments, and ( 2) multiple-domain aMCI (aMCI-MD), with episodic memory impairments and deficits in one or more other cognitive domains. Aims: To map the pattern of gray matter ( GM) atrophy associated with aMCI-SD, aMCI-MD and mild AD. Methods: A group of aMCI-SD, aMCI-MD characterized by executive function disorders, mild AD and cognitively unimpaired subjects underwent a comprehensive neuropsychological assessment and a high-definition MR brain scan. Voxel-based morphometry analysis was used to characterize the GM tissue loss in each patient group, and the common pattern of GM atrophy in aMCI-SD and aMCI- MD. Results: aMCI-SD and aMCI- MD are characterized by a common pattern of GM atrophy within the medial temporal cortex, predisposing to AD and correlating with the severity of verbal memory symptoms. Moreover, the pattern of GM atrophy observed in aMCI-SD, aMCI-MD and mild AD revealed that, from an anatomical point of view, these three clinical syndromes could represent three severity points along the continuum between normal aging and AD.

The Role of Sex and Gender Socialization in Stress Reactivity	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						sex; gender; stress; disease; development	PITUITARY-ADRENAL AXIS; ESTROGEN-RECEPTOR-BETA; CORTICOTROPIN-RELEASING HORMONE; ACUTE PSYCHOSOCIAL STRESS; PSYCHOLOGICAL STRESS; HIPPOCAMPAL VOLUME; CORTISOL RESPONSES; MATERNAL-CARE; SELF-ESTEEM; CATECHOLAMINE RESPONSES	Individual health is determined by a myriad of factors. Interestingly, simply being male or female is one such factor that carries profound implications for one's well-being. Intriguing differences between men and women have been observed with respect to vulnerability to and prevalence of particular illnesses. The activity of the major stress hormone axis in humans, the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis, is directly and indirectly associated with the onset and propagation of these conditions. Previous studies have shown differences between men and women at the level of stress hormone regulation, suggesting that the metabolic effects of stress may be related to susceptibility for stress-related disease. While the majority of studies have suggested that biological differences are responsible, few have also considered the role of gender socialization. In this selective review, the authors summarize evidence on sex differences and highlight some recent results from endocrinological, developmental, and neuroimaging studies that suggest an important role of gender socialization on the metabolic effects of stress. Finally, a model is proposed that integrates these specific findings, highlighting gender socialization and stress responsivity.

J	Cervero, F				Cervero, Fernando			Visceral versus Somatic Pain: Similarities and Differences	DIGESTIVE DISEASES			English	Article						Somatic pain; Visceral pain; Central nervous system	INDUCED NOCICEPTIVE RESPONSES; UTERINE CERVICAL DISTENSION; BLADDER EPITHELIAL-CELLS; IRRITABLE-BOWEL-SYNDROME; LONG-TERM POTENTIATION; DORSAL-HORN NEURONS; VANILLOID RECEPTOR; MENSTRUAL-CYCLE; SEX-HORMONES; SPINAL-CORD	Inflammatory bowel disease and the irritable bowel syndrome are conditions characterized by chronic pain that generates persistent, hyperalgesic states in many regions of the body. It is difficult to explain the pain of conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease and irritable bowel syndrome by extrapolating directly from what is known about the mechanisms of somatic pain. Visceral and somatic pain show many differences not only in the psychophysics of the sensation, but also in the neurobiological mechanisms that mediate the sensory process. The activation and sensitization of visceral nociceptors are heavily influenced by the secretory and motor properties of the microenvironment where the sensory receptors are located. In some cases, epithelial cells can play a direct role in the activation of primary sensory neurons. Subclinical alterations of the epithelium can contribute to enhanced visceral sensitivity. Central hypersensitivity induced by visceral activation also shows differences with its somatic counterpart. Mobilization of AMPA receptors from the cytosol to the membrane of nociceptive neurons has been identified as a mechanism of sensitization of visceral pain pathways. Finally, functional pain syndromes, such as irritable bowel syndrome could be triggered or maintained by hormonal alterations, particularly those involving sex hormones such as estrogen.

To identify clinical outcomes, clinical process, healthcare utilization and costs associated with telerehabilitation for individuals with physical disabilities. Method. Relevant databases were searched for articles on telerehabilitation published until February 2007. Reference lists were examined and key journals were hand searched. Studies that included telerehabilitation for individuals with physical impairments and used experimental or observational study designs were included in the analysis, regardless of the specific clientele or location of services. Data was extracted using a form to record methodological aspects and results relating to clinical, process, healthcare utilization and cost outcomes. Study quality of randomized clinical trials was assessed using the PEDro rating scale. Results. Some 28 articles were analysed. These dealt with rehabilitation of individuals in the community, neurological rehabilitation, cardiac rehabilitation, follow-up of individuals with spinal cord injuries, rehabilitation for speech-language impairments, and rehabilitation for varied clienteles. Clinical outcomes were generally improved following a telerehabilitation intervention and were at least similar to or better than an alternative intervention. Clinical process outcomes, such as attendance and compliance, were high with telerehabilitation although few comparisons are made to alternative interventions. Consultation time tended to be longer with telerehabilitation. Satisfaction with telerehabilitation was consistently high, although it was higher for patients than therapists. Few studies examined healthcare utilization measures and those that did reported mixed findings with respect to adverse events, use of emergency rooms and doctor visits. Only five of the studies examined costs. There is some preliminary evidence of potential cost savings for the healthcare facility. Conclusions. While evidence is mounting concerning the efficacy and effectiveness of telerehabilitation, high-quality evidence regarding impact on resource allocation and costs is still needed to support clinical and policy decision-making.
