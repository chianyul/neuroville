Background.-The flickering or scintillating quality of aura elements is a commonly described characteristic of visual migraine auras. Hypotheses about the neural mechanisms involved in aura have rarely taken this feature into account, perhaps because of a lack of quantitative data on this aspect of the aura. While a rate of 10 Hertz had been suggested in the literature, estimates have been speculative due to the difficulty of judging temporal frequencies subjectively. Methods.-Eleven participants were given portable devices that contained an adjustable light-emitting diode with which to match the flickering of their auras. Observers were asked to make flicker matches at two time points so that rate change during aura progression could be analyzed. Results.-Data were obtained for 36 aura episodes. The mean rate of flicker across individuals was 17.8 Hertz. Rates varied widely between individuals, but were more consistent across multiple episodes in the same observer, Rate of nicker did not appear to relate to aura side or type, or to individual characteristics such as migraine history. When episodes were analyzed for change in flicker rate over time, patterns of increase (n = 7), decrease (n = 4), and no change (n = 22) were all observed. Conclusions.-When measured with an objective task, aura scintillation rates were found to be somewhat higher than previous anecdotal observations had suggested. These data are discussed in the context of two competing hypotheses concerning the neural mechanism underlying the flicker percept during migraine aura.

In particular, they offer the possibility of controlling both the extent and locus of brain lesions, and the exact nature of the experiences to be remembered. Taking advantage of these possibilities, recent studies indicated that the graded retrograde amnesia often seen after lesions to the hippocampal system is not uniform across lesion site and task, nor is it an indication that all of the remembered information available in intact subjects becomes available after hippocampal system lesions made a long time after learning. Rather, these studies support the notion that information is stored in both hippocampal and extrahipocampal sites, and that retrieval from different sites involves access to different kinds of information. The strongest evidence in support of this view is the set of findings indicating that when remote memories are retrieved, in either human or animal subjects that have suffered hippocampal system damage, these memories are not qualitatively the same as remote memories retrieved in intact subjects. In sum, memory appears to be rather more dynamic than most current conceptions allow, such that retrieval events trigger new encodings, and these new encodings engage the hippocampal system once again. As a result, older, reactivated memories become more resistant to disruption, and this mechanism helps to explain why graded retrograde amnesia is sometimes seen after brain damage. The use of new neuroimaging techniques, coupled with more sensitive neuropsychological tests in lesioned subjects, should further illuminate the complex nature of memory in coming years. It is likely that animal studies will continue to prove important in these developments. (C) 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Ca2+ responses induced by local application of glutamate were unaffected by the sodium channel blocker tetrodotoxin and were therefore due to direct actions on glial cells. Glutamate-evoked responses were significantly reduced by the L-type Ca2+ channel blocker nimodipine, the group I/II metabotropic glutamate receptor antagonist (S)-alpha -methyl-4-carboxyphenylglycine (MCPG), and the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist (+/-)2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (APV). However, glutamate-induced Ca2+ responses were not significantly reduced by the non-NMDA receptor antagonist 6-cyano-7-nitro-quinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX). These results indicate that local application of glutamate increases intracellular Ca2+ levels in glial cells via the activation of L-type Ca2+ channels, NMDA receptors, and metabotropic glutamate receptors. Brief (1 s) tetanization of Schaffer collaterals produced increases in intracellular Ca2+ levels in glial cells that were dependent on the frequency of stimulation (greater than or equal to 50 Hz) and on synaptic transmission (abolished by tetrodotoxin). These Ca2+ responses were also antagonized by the L-type Ca2+ channel blocker nimodipine and the metabotropic glutamate receptor antagonist MCPG. However, the non-NMDA receptor antagonist CNQX significantly reduced the Schaffer collateral-evoked Ca2+ responses, while the NMDA antagonist APV did not. Thus, these synaptically mediated Ca2+ responses in glial cells involve the activation of L-type Ca2+ channels, group I/II metabotropic glutamate receptors, and non-NMDA receptors. These findings indicate that increases in intracellular Ca2+ levels induced in glial cells by local glutamate application and by synaptic activity share similar mechanisms (activation of L-type Ca2+ channels and group I/II metabotropic glutamate receptors) but also have distinct components (NMDA vs. non-NMDA receptor activation, respectively). Therefore, neuron-glia interactions in rat hippocampus in situ involve multiple, complex Ca2+-mediated processes that may not be mimicked by local glutamate application. Hippocampos 2001;11:132-145.

Cells included in this study (n = 59) had resting membrane potential (RMP) = -73.9 +/- 8.5 mV (mean +/- SD), action potential amplitude = 95.5 +/- 10.4 mV, input resistance = 36.1 +/- v 15.7 M Omega, and time constant = 13.9 +/- 3.4 ms. When filled with neurobiotin (n = 27) they displayed a pyramidal shape with an apical dendrite and extensive basal dendritic tree. injection of intracellular current pulses revealed: 1) tetrodotoxin (TTX, 1 muM)-sensitive, inward rectification in the depolarizing direction (n = 6), and 2) a time- and voltage-dependent hyperpolarizing sag that was blocked by extracellular Cs+ (3 mM, n = 5) application. Prolonged (up to 3 s) depolarizing pulses made perirhinal cells discharge regular firing of fast action potentials that diminished over time in frequency and reached a steady level (i.e., adapted). Repetitive firing was followed by an afterhyperpolarization that was decreased, along with firing adaptation, by the Ca2+-channel blocker Co2+ (2 mM, n = 6). Action potential broadening became evident during repetitive firing. This behavior, which was more pronounced when larger pulses of depolarizing current were injected (and thus when repetitive firing attained higher rates), was markedly decreased by Co2+ application. Subthreshold membrane oscillations at 5-12 Hz became apparent when cells were depolarized by 10-20 mV from RMP, and action potential clusters appeared with further depolarization. Application of glutamatergic and GABA(A) receptor antagonists (n = 4), Co2+ (n = 6), or Cs+ (n = 5) did not prevent the occurrence of these oscillations that were abolished by TTX (n = 6). Our results show that pyramidal-like neurons in the perirhinal cortex are regular firing cells with electrophysiological features resembling those of other cortical pyramidal elements. The ability to generate subthreshold membrane oscillations may play a role in synaptic plasticity and thus in the mnemonic processes typical of this limbic structure. Hippocampus 2001;11:662-672.

In the present study, we used in vitro receptor autoradiography, subcellular fractionation, and immunoblotting to investigate its effects on alpha -amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionate (AMPA) and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. Qualitative and quantitative analysis of H-3-AMPA binding indicated that incubation of frozen-thawed brain sections with InsP6 at 35 degreesC enhanced AMPA receptor binding in several brain regions, with maximal increases in the hippocampus and cerebellum. Moreover, saturation kinetics demonstrated that InsP6-induced augmentation of AMPA binding was due to an increment in the maximal number of AMPA binding sites. At the immunological level, Western blots performed on crude mitochondrial/synaptic (P2) fractions revealed that InsP6 (but not InsP5 and InsP3) treatment increased glutamate receptor (GluR)1 and GluR2 subunits of AMPA receptors, an effect that was associated with concomitant reductions in microsomal (P3) fractions. Interestingly, the InsP6-induced modulation of AMPA receptor binding was blocked at room temperature, and pretreatment with heparin also dampered its action on both AMPA receptor binding and GluR subunits. These effects of InsP6 appear to be specific to AMPA receptors, as neither H-3-glutamate binding to NMDA receptors nor levels of NR1 and NR2A subunits in P2 and P3 fractions were affected. Taken together, our data strongly suggest that InsP6 specifically regulates AMPA receptor distribution, possibly through a clathrin-dependent process. Hippocampus 2001;11:673-682.

Mohamad Sawan, at the Ecole Polytechnique de Montreal. Such devices are dedicated to recuperate or enhance neuromuscular functions in patients by means of peripherals or central nervous systems. While the bladder controllor is dedicated to recuperate voiding and retention functions on paralyzed patients, the electronic visual stimulator is dedicated to create an adequate vision for totally blind patients. Neural peripheral sacral stimulation is applied to recover the bladder function, but direct stimulation of the brain, is the basic principle of the visual cortex stimulator proposed by PolySTIM. The talk will focus on these two applications. Dr. Sawan will elaborate the design and validation of the visual implant that involves advanced stimulator mounted on a matrix of 25x25 microelectrodes which will be implanted on the visuel cortex to recuperate partiel vision for blind patients. This type of pluridisciplinary projects include a wide variety of domains of interest in Microelectronics, RF electronics, mechanical, biomaterial, physics, chemical, as well as in various medical domains such as Neurology, etc.	Ecole Polytech, Montreal, PQ H3C 3A7, Canada	Sawan, M (reprint author), Ecole Polytech, Montreal, PQ H3C 3A7, Canada.							0	0	0	0	2	IEEE	NEW YORK	345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA			0-7803-7522-X	INT C MICROELECTRON			2001							19	19				1	Computer Science, Hardware & Architecture; Computer Science, Software Engineering; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic	Computer Science; Engineering	BU50B	WOS:000176153500004		No			2017-07-26

We propose to make use of a scheme that iterates between correcting for intensity differences between images and performing standard monomodal registration. The care of our contribution resides in providing a method that finds the transformation that maps the intensities of one image to those of another, It makes the assumption that there are at most two functional dependencies between the intensities of structures present in the images to register, and relies on robust estimation techniques to evaluate these functions. We provide results showing successful registration between several imaging modalities involving segmentations, T1 magnetic resonance (MR), T2 MR, proton density (PD) MR and computed tomography (CT), We also argue that our intensity modeling mag be more appropriate than mutual information (MI) in the contest of evaluating high-dimensional deformations, as it puts more constraints on the parameters to be estimated and, thus, permits a better search of the parameter space.

For example, these conditional distributions can be linear, logistic, or nonlinear (using for example multilayer neural networks), We compare the generalization performance of several models which are special cases of input-output hidden Markov models on financial time-series prediction tasks: an unconditional Gaussian, a conditional linear Gaussian, a mixture of Gaussians, a mixture of conditional linear Gaussians, a hidden Markov model, and various IOHMMs. The experiments compare these models on predicting the conditional density of returns of market and sector indices. Note that the unconditional Gaussian estimates the first moment with the historical average. The results show that, although for the first moment the historical average gives the best results, for the higher moments, the IOHMMs yielded significantly better performance, as estimated by the out-of-sample likelihood.

J	Shultz, TR; Bale, AC				Shultz, Thomas R.; Bale, Alan C.			Neural Network Simulation of Infant Familiarization to Artificial Sentences: Rule-Like Behavior Without Explicit Rules and Variables	INFANCY			English	Article								A fundamental issue in cognitive science is whether human cognitive processing is better explained by symbolic rules or by subsymbolic neural networks. A recent study of infant familiarization to sentences in an artificial language seems to have produced data that can only be explained by symbolic rule learning and not by unstructured neural networks (Marcus, Vijayan, Bandi Rao, & Vishton, 1999). Here we present successful unstructured neural network simulations of the infant data, showing that these data do not uniquely support a rule-based account. In contrast to other simulations of these data, these simulations cover more aspects of the data with fewer assumptions about prior knowledge and training, using a more realistic coding scheme based on sonority of phonemes. The networks show exponential decreases in attention to a repeated sentence pattern, more recovery to novel sentences inconsistent with the familiar pattern than to novel sentences consistent with the familiar pattern, occasional familiarity preferences, more recovery to consistent novel sentences than to familiarized sentences, and extrapolative generalization outside the range of the training patterns. A variety of predictions suggest the utility of the model in guiding future psychological work. The evidence, from these and other simulations, supports the view that unstructured neural networks can account for the existing infant data.

The key idea consists of 'boosting' the capacity of a baseline ASR system to identify features as subtle as emphasis, gemination or relevant vowel lengthening. The 'booster' part is composed of a mixture of Time Delay Neural Networks (TDNNs) using an autoregressive version of the backpropagation algorithm. We choose to carry out trials on the Arabic language, which is characterized by the presence of complex features. We use 3 baseline systems: Hidden Markov Models (HMM), optimized version of Learning Vector Quantization algorithm (O-2 LVQ1) and classical K-nearest neighbors' classifier (KNN), The reported results showed clearly the effectiveness of the approach since the three hybrid systems (HMM/TDNN, O(2)LVQ1/TDNN, KNN/TDNN) perform significantly better than their corresponding baseline systems.

The challenge is to maintain a high performance and not to misrecognize confusing patterns. In some applications, it is desirable to reject a pattern instead of running the risk of misclassifying it. In order to improve the reliability of a single neural network classifier on confusing numerals, knowledge from five human experts is gathered and analyzed. A new way to construct database and represent the required output values in the output layer of MLP's training process is given in this paper. Experiments on a synthesized confusing database and a real database show that the proposed approach will facilitate the design of a highly reliable single neural network classifier.

It is about cutting the material with maximum metal removal, in shortest time, with best surface finish while having maximum tool life. The high quality of surface finish is very important in order to face the required accuracy and marketing needs. In this paper we present a technique for modeling a machining process of Alumic-79 with 2 and 4-flutes cutting head. In this paper, optimum parameters, which are feed rate, spindle speed and depth of cut, are found for 2-flutes and 4-flutes cutting head to obtain a high quality surface finish.

The Golgi apparatus was devoid of cytochemical reaction beside the trans-Golgi network cisternae, which showed a positive reaction. The RER of some acinar cells also presented a signal, demonstrating their capability of synthesizing AChE. Immunogold using a specific anti-AChE antibody yielded similar results. Double-labeling experiments corroborated the presence of enzyme cytochemical and immunocytochemical signals in the same lysosomal tubular network. Biochemical sedimentation assays confirmed the presence of AChE in acinar cells, which exists as two globular molecular forms, G(1) and G(4) These results were obtained with pancreatic tissue in situ as well as with isolated acinar cells maintained in culture and devoid of neural elements. The existence of a continuous tubular lysosomal network containing AChE is in agreement with previous reports on acinar and other cell types, and supports a more general hypothesis on dynamic continuities among cell structures. Whether AChE is being secreted by the acinar cells or internalized through this endo-lysosomal system was not defined. However, the capability of the acinar cells to synthesize AChE and to channel it through a tubular system is a good indication that the cells can modulate their cholinergic stimulation for optimal secretion of digestive enzymes.

The disease is caused by an unstable expansion of the CAG repeat in the MJD gene. This gene is mapped to chromosome 14q32.1. To determine its genomic structure, we constructed a contig composed of six cosmid clones and eight bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones. It spans approximately 300kb and includes MJD. We also determined the complete sequence (175,330bp) of B445M7, a human BAC clone that contains MJD. The MJD gene was found to span 48,240bp and to contain 11 exons. Northern blot analysis showed that MJD mRNA is ubiquitously expressed in human tissues, and in at least four different sizes; namely, 1.4, 1.8, 4.5, and 7.5kb. These different mRNA species probably result from differential splicing and polyadenylation, as shown by sequences of the 21 independent cDNA clones isolated after the screening of four human cDNA libraries prepared from whole brain, caudate, retina, and testis. The sequences of these latter clones relative to the MJD gene in B345M7 indicate that there are three alternative splicing sites and eight polyadenylation signals in MJD that are used to generate the differently sized transcripts.

Recently, we identified a cis-acting dendritic targeting element (DTE) in MAP2 mRNAs. Here we used the yeast tri-hybrid system to identify potential trans-acting RNA-binding factors of the DTE. A cDNA clone was isolated that encodes a member of a mammalian protein family that is highly homologous to the Drosophila RNA-binding protein Staufen. Mammalian Staufen appears to be expressed in most tissues and brain areas. Two distinct rat brain Staufen isoforms, rStau+I6 and rStau-I6, are encoded by alternatively spliced mRNAs, Both isoforms contain four double-stranded RNA-binding domains (dsRBD). In the larger rStau+I6 isoform, six additional amino acids are inserted in the second dsRBD, Although both isoforms interacted with the MAP2-DTE and various additional RNA fragments in an in vitro north-western assay, rStau-I6 exhibited a stronger signal of bound radioactively labelled RNAs as compared with rStau+I6. Using an antibody directed against mammalian Staufen, the protein was detected in somata and dendrites of neurones of the adult rat hippocampus and cerebral cortex. Ultrastructural studies revealed that in dendrites, rat Staufen accumulates along microtubules. Thus in neurones, rat Staufen may serve to link RNAs to the dendritic microtubular cytoskeleton and may thereby regulate their subcellular localization.

This study describes the distribution and functional role of a high voltage-activating K+ channel in the electrosensory lobe (ELL) of an apteronotid weakly electric fish. We identify a homolog of the Kv3.3 K+ channel, AptKv3.3, that exhibits a high density of mRNA expression and immunolabel that is distributed over the entire soma-dendritic axis of ELL pyramidal cells. The kinetics and pharmacology of native K+ channels recorded in pyramidal cell somata and apical dendrites match those of AptKv3.3 channels expressed in a heterologous expression system. The functional role of AptKv3.3 channels was assessed using focal drug ejections in somatic and dendritic regions of an in vitro slice preparation. Local blockade of AptKv3.3 channels slows the repolarization of spikes in pyramidal cell somata as well as spikes backpropagating into apical dendrites. The resulting increase in dendritic spike duration lowers the threshold for a gamma -frequency burst discharge that is driven by inward current associated with backpropagating dendritic spikes. Thus, dendritic AptKv3.3 K+ channels influence the threshold for a form of burst discharge that has an established role in feature extraction of sensory input.

Within the medial temporal lobe, special attention has been paid to the hippocampus (HC) and amygdala (AG) because of their role in memory, depression, emotion, and learning. Volume changes in these areas have been observed in conjunction with certain disease states, e.g. Alzheimer's disease, post-traumatic stress disorder, and depression. Aging has also been shown to result in gray matter volume loss of the overall brain, including the HC. With regard to gender specificity, results suggest a larger shrinkage for men of brain gray matter, with controversial observations being made for the HC. With recently refined MRI acquisition and segmentation protocols, the HC and AG of 80 subjects in early adulthood (39 men and 41 women, age 18-42 years) were investigated. Whereas the volume of the AG appeared to be independent of age and gender, a significant negative correlation with age for both left and right HC was found in men (r = -0.47 and -0.44, respectively) but not in women (r = 0.01 and 0.02, respectively). The volume decline in men appeared to be linear, starting at the beginning of the third life decade and approximating 1.5% per annum. Using voxel-based regressional analysis, it was shown that changes with age occurred mostly in the head and tail of the HC. This finding underscores the need to include sociodemographic variables in functional and anatomical MRI designs.

Under current-clamp conditions, EtOH increased glycine-induced membrane depolarization and action potential firing. Under voltage-clamp conditions, EtOH (0.1-40 mM) alone did not elicit a current. When coapplied with glycine, EtOH enhanced the glycine-induced current in 35% (180 of 474) of the neurons. The EtOH-induced enhancement of glycine current was independent of membrane potential (between -60 and +60 mV); the reversal potential was not changed. Concentration-response analysis showed that in the presence of EtOH (10 mM), the EC50 for glycine decreased from 25 +/- 4 to 14 +/- 3 muM; the Hill coefficient increased from 1.5 +/- 0.2 to 1.9 +/- 0.3. Kinetic analysis of glycine currents indicated that EtOH decreased the time constant of activation and increased the time constant of deactivation of glycine-gated chloride channels. EtOH may accelerate glycine association with its receptor at the agonist binding site and increase the apparent agonist affinity. Our observations suggest that, at pharmacologically relevant concentrations, EtOH alters the function of glycine receptors and thus the excitability of neonatal VTA neurons. This action of EtOH may contribute to the neurobehavioral disturbances associated with fetal alcohol syndrome.

With respect to the 5-HT system, antidepressant drugs exert immediate effects on some neuronal elements controlling overall transmission, but it is the gradual changes in neuronal responses to such treatments that are ultimately responsible for producing their therapeutic benefits. In major depression, an increase in 5-HT1A transmission is thought to be a crucial determinant of the antidepressant response, whereas an enhancement of 5-HT2 transmission in the orbitofrontal cortex may mediate the therapeutic effect of 5-HT reuptake inhibitors in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). The doses of medication and the durations of treatment necessary to obtain these alterations in 5-HT transmission in various brain structures of laboratory animals are fully consistent with the conditions in the clinic necessary to attenuate symptoms in depression and OCD. It is also possible that the relief of chronic pain produced by some antidepressants may be mediated, in part, by the blockade of peripheral 5-HT2A receptors. These observations emphasize the notion that the 5-HT system is endowed with different adaptive properties in various parts of the body, which, in addition to the multiplicity of 5-HT receptors, makes this chemospecific network important in many disorders.

Method: The subjects were 86 school-age children (75 males, 11 females) referred for psychiatric day treatment. Thirty-five of the children met criteria for borderline pathology. Data on psychosocial risk factors were obtained for each child from a questionnaire completed by members of the child's clinical team and were based on interviews with parents and children, as well as reports from schools and social agencies. Neuropsychological measures included computerized versions of the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test and the Continuous Performance Test. Results: Both deficits in executive function and psychological trauma made significant and independent contributions to the variance in borderline pathology. Inclusion of both sets of risk factors produced a model that explained 48% of the variance in borderline diagnosis. Conclusions: Both environmental risks and neurobiological vulnerability should be taken into account to understand the etiology of borderline pathology in children.

Virologic and immunologic surrogate markers have proven useful in following HIV-associated viral burden, immune dysregulation, dysfunction and deficiency. Monitoring of sequential changes in these markers and their interrelationships may provide significant information about viral-host-drug dynamics. The complexity and fluidity of these changes necessitates that an efficient means be developed for their monitoring. Me therefore generated a neural network-based model for assessing host dynamics over time and compared its performance with that of a multiple regression model. Both modeling approaches were applied to the actual, non-filtered, clinical observations on 58 HIV-infected individuals treated consistently with Highly Active Anti-Retroviral Therapy (HAART), for a period of over-52 weeks resulting in an average of 16 observations per patient throughout this time span. Results demonstrated that the neural network was at least as accurate as a multi-regression model. Since our dataset was modest in size we also believe that neural networks warrant further consideration for modeling the complexity of HIV-host dynamics on larger datasets.

Materials and Methods: A total of 177 patients with urinary retention refractory to standard therapy were enrolled in the study. Greater than 50% improvement in baseline voiding symptoms during a 3 to 7-day percutaneous test stimulation qualified a patient for surgical implantation of an InterStim parallel to system. Of the patients who qualified for implantation 37 were randomly assigned to a treatment and 31 to a control group. Patients in the treatment group underwent early surgical implantation of the sacral nerve stimulation system, while implantation was delayed in the control group for 6 months. Followup evaluations, including voiding diary analysis and temporary deactivation of the stimulator at 6 months, were conducted at 1, 3, 6, 12 and 18 months after implantation in the treatment group, and after 3 and 6 months in the control group. Results: Compared to the control group, patients implanted with the InterStim system had statistically and clinically significant reductions in the catheter volume per catheterization (p <0.0001). Of the patients treated with implants 69% eliminated catheterization at 6 months and an additional 14% had a 50% or greater reduction in catheter volume per catheterization. Therefore, successful results were achieved in 83% of the implant group with retention compared to 9% of the control group at 6 months. Temporary inactivation of sacral nerve stimulation therapy resulted in a significant increase in residual volumes (p <0.0001) but effectiveness of sacral nerve stimulation was sustained through 18 months after implant. Conclusions: Results of this prospective, randomized clinical study demonstrate that sacral nerve stimulation is effective for restoring voiding in patients with retention who are refractory to other forms of treatment.

The learning framework consists of quantization layer and ensemble layer. After GLVQ and MLP are applied to the framework, the proposed method is tested on public handwritten lowercase data sets, which obtains a promising performance consistently. Further, in contrast to LeNet5, an effective neural network structure, our method is especially suitable for a large-scale real-world classification problem although it is easily scaled to a small training set with preserving a good performance.

Neuroblastoma has several characteristics that suggest that preclinical diagnosis might improve outcome. Therefore, the Quebec Neuroblastoma Screening Project was undertaken from 1989 to 1994 to examine infants at 3 weeks and 6 months by measuring urinary catecholamine metabolites. Procedure. Over the 5-yr period, 45 tumors were detected by screening, 20 were identified clinically prior to the third week, and 64 were identified clinically at a later time. We analyzed available tumors for Shimada histopathology, tumor ploidy, MYCN copy number and serum ferritin. Results. Of the tumors detected by screening, only 2 of 45 tested had unfavorable histology, 2 of 45 had diploid or tetraploid DNA content, 0 of 43 had MYCN amplification, and 4 of 44 had elevated serum ferritin. All of these patients are alive and well. The 20 patients detected prior to the 3-week screen had similar biological characteristics. In contrast, of the patients detected clinically after 3 weeks of age, 19 of 51 tested had unfavorable histology, 25 of 66 had diploid or tetraploid tumors, 12 of 56 had MYCN amplification, and 14 of 54 had elevated ferritin. Conclusions. The difference between the screened and clinically detected cases was highly significant for each biological variable. Preliminary data on other biological variables, such as neurotrophin expression and allelic loss on Ip in these patients are consistent with the above findings. These data suggest that mass screening for neuroblastoma at or before 6 months of age detects almost exclusively tumors that have favorable biological characteristics, many of which might have regressed spontaneously. Thus, continued mass screening for neuroblastoma at 6 months is unlikely to accomplish its intended goal, and should probably be discontinued. Med. Pediatr. Oncol. 36:157-159 2001.

Excess blood-borne ammonia crosses the blood-brain barrier by diffusion as NH3 where it interacts with various cellular processes involved in neurotransmission and brain energy metabolism. Ammonia exerts a potent effect on glutamate (AMPA) receptor-mediated neurotransmission. Ammonia also inhibits high affinity transport of glutamate by an action on astrocytic glutamate transporter expression, an action which results in increased extracellular concentrations of glutamate. Acute hyperammonemia directly activates the NMDA subclass of glutamate receptors resulting in increased intracellular Ca2+ and increased synthesis of nitric oxide and cGMP. Chronic hyperammonemia, on the other hand, results in a loss of NMDA receptor sites. Activation of NMDA receptors in acute ammonia toxicity results in depletion of ATP in brain. Neuropathologic studies in experimental animals with congenital urea cycle disorders and severe hyperammonemia reveal evidence of neuronal cell death which is excitotoxic in nature. These findings suggest that overactivation of NMDA receptors is a significant feature of acute hyperammonemic syndromes and that antagonists of these receptors or of their signal transduction pathway enzymes such as nNOS could be beneficial in the treatment of the central nervous system manifestations (encephalopathy, brain edema) which are characteristic of hyperammonemic disorders.

Considerations including factors affecting probe recoveries, the blood-brain barrier, and tissue reactions to probe implantation are discussed in this paper. Details of the application of in vivo microdialysis to an animal model of encephalopathy are then presented. Thiamine deficiency encephalopathy is an animal model of Wernicke encephalopathy, a neurological disorder observed in alcoholics and in patients with severely compromised nutrition. Regionally selective neuronal cell death is observed in both patients and animals with thiamine deficiency (TD). Various thalamic nuclei suffer significant TD-induced cell death, and NMDA receptor-mediated glutamate excitotoxicity has been proposed as an underlying causative factor. A detailed methodology for the examination of the role of glutamate excitotoxicity using in vivo microdialysis in the neuronal cell death due to thiamine deficiency is presented.

Evidence suggests that pharmacologically distinct GABA(B) receptor subtypes mediate presynaptic inhibition of neurotransmitter release by reducing Ca2+ conductance, and postsynaptic inhibition of neuronal excitability by activating inwardly rectifying K+ (Kir) conductance. However, the cloning of GABA(B) gb1 and gb2 receptor genes and identification of the functional GABA(B) gb1-gb2 receptor heterodimer have so far failed to substantiate the existence of pharmacologically distinct receptor subtypes. The anticonvulsant, antihyperalgesic, and anxiolytic agent gabapentin (Neurontin) is a 3-alkylated GABA analog with an unknown mechanism of action. Here we report that gabapentin is an agonist at the GABA(B) gb1a-gb2 heterodimer coupled to Kir 3.1/3.2 inwardly rectifying K+ channels in Xenopus laevis oocytes. Gabapentin was practically inactive at the human gb1b-gb2 heterodimer, a novel human gb1c-gb2 heterodimer and did not block GABA agonism at these heterodimer subtypes. Gabapentin was not an agonist at recombinant GABA(A) receptors as well. In CA1 pyramidal neurons of rat hippocampal slices, gabapentin activated postsynaptic K+ currents, probably via the gb1a-gb2 heterodimer coupled to inward rectifiers, but did not presynaptically depress monosynaptic GABA(A) inhibitory postsynaptic currents. Gabapentin is the first GABA(B) receptor subtype-selective agonist identified providing proof of pharmacologically and physiologically distinct receptor subtypes. This selective agonism of postsynaptic GABA(B) receptor subtypes by gabapentin in hippocampal neurons may be its key therapeutic advantage as an anticonvulsant.

In this study, we investigated TPH and suicide completion, the most severe form of suicidal behavior. A relatively large sample of suicide completers (n = 101) was genotyped at three TPH loci (two polymorphisms in the promoter region, A-6526G and G-5806T, and one in intron 7, A218C) and compared to psychiatrically normal living controls (n = 129). Although no significant differences were found between groups for genetic variation at single loci, haplotype analysis revealed that one haplotype (6-6526G -5806T 218C) was significantly more frequent among suicide cases than in normal controls (chi (2) = 11.30, df = 2, P = 0.0008; OR = 2.0 CI: 1.30-3.6). Further analyses suggested that this haplotype is particularly more frequent among subjects who committed suicide using violent methods. Similar results were observed in recent haplotype analyses in suicide attempters, which found that the equivalent of haplotype -6526G -5806T 218C was more frequent in impulsive attempters (Rotondo et al, Mol Psychiatry 1999; 4: 360-368).

These receptors are expressed at excitatory cholinergic synapses between sympathetic preganglionic neurons and postganglionic sympathetic neurons and link the integrative activities of the CNS with peripheral effector mechanisms of the sympathetic nervous system. Nicotinic AChRs are also expressed on a subset of vagal afferent neurons, including those involved in baroreceptor reflexes. This review discusses the developmental expression of nAChRs on vagal afferent neurons and two factors that influence the differentiation of these neurons: ganglionic satellite cells and neurotrophins. In addition, this review discusses two important properties of neuronal nAChRs. inward rectification and calcium permeability. At the molecular level, intracellular polyamines, acting as gating particles, effectively block the receptor pore in a voltage-dependent manner, producing inward rectification. Moreover, a critical structural determinant underlies both the block by intracellular polyamines and calcium permeability. Finally, this review discusses the modulation and block of neuronal nAChRs by extracellular polyamines and the possible implications for neurodegenerative diseases.

Transcranial Doppler measurements of middle cerebral artery blood velocity (CBV) is at present the only technique for assessing rapid changes in cerebral blood flow, and hence for evaluating dynamic cerebral autoregulation. However, controversies exist regarding data interpretation. At syncope, during the collapse of blood pressure (BP), diastolic CBV diminishes, whereas systolic CBV is maintained. Some consider this increase in CBV pulsatility to be indicative of a paradoxical increase in cerebrovascular resistance (CVR) prior to syncope. Others note that mean CBV decreases much less than does mean BP, implying that cerebral autoregulatory mechanisms are intact and functioning at syncope. Similarly, there is no evidence of impaired dynamic cerebral autoregulation, as measured by standard linear transfer-function analysis, in patients with NMS. Some patients with exaggerated postural tachycardia (POTS) have been found to have an excessive decrease in CBV during bead-up tilt. Controversy exists as to whether this decrease results from an excessive sympathetic outflow to the cerebral vasculature or from hyperventilation. However, many other equally symptomatic patients with a similar hemodynamic profile of exaggerated tachycardia during head-up tilt have normal CBV changes during this maneuver and have normal dynamic cerebral autoregulation as determined by transfer-function analysis. Whether these discrepancies reflect different pathologies in patients with POTS is currently unknown.

Qualitative as well as quantitative analysis of brain sections in both young and aged apoE-deficient mice did not reveal any substantial changes of AMPA receptor binding in the various hippocampal regions, compared to age-matched controls. Nevertheless, enhancement of AMPA receptor binding elicited by PS treatment was found to be abolished in most hippocampal regions of young apoE-deficient mice, while modulation of AMPA receptors by this phospholipid was not significantly altered in the hippocampal formation of aged apoE-deficient animals. At the electrophysiological level, long-tel-m potentiation (LTP) induced by theta burst stimulation was lower in area. CA1 of the hippocampus of young, but not aged, apoE-deficient mice compared to age-matched controls. These results confirm that apoE is important for AMPA receptor regulation and LTP expression in the hippocampal formation. However, the presence of LTP in aged apoE-deficient animals, together with apparent recovery of the PS action on AMPA receptors, suggests that aged apoE-knockout mice possess compensatory mechanisms that reduce biochemical and electrophysiological alterations of glutamatergic neurons.

In order to assess this possibility, binding sites for the high affinity NA transporter ligand [H-3]-nisoxetine were measured by quantitative receptor autoradiography in the brains of rats with acute liver failure resulting from hepatic devascularization and in appropriate controls. In vivo microdialysis was used to measure extracellular brain concentrations of NA. Severe encephalopathy resulted in a significant loss of [3H]-nisoxetine sites in frontal cortex and a concomitant increase in extracellular brain concentrations of NA in rats with acute liver failure. A loss of transporter sites was also observed in thalamus of rats with acute liver failure. This loss of NA transporter sites could result from depletion of central NA stores due to a reserpine-like effect of ammonia which is known to accumulate to millimolar concentrations in brain in ischemic liver failure. Impaired NA transport and the consequent increase in synaptic concentrations and increased stimulation of neuronal and astrocytic noradrenergic receptors could be implicated in the pathogenesis of the encephalopathy and brain edema characteristic of acute liver failure.

Thus, direct blockade of 5-HT and noradrenaline (NA) transporters cannot account entirely for their clinical efficacy, and other long-term changes may be involved. Adult Sprague Dawley rats were treated for 21 days with daily injections of either desipramine, trimipramine, fluoxetine, or venlafaxine; a fifth group that was used as a control, received daily saline injections. Identified cortical areas, hippocampal divisions and nuclei raphe dorsalis, raphe medialis and locus coeruleus were examined by quantitative autoradiography using either [H-3]citalopram to label 5-HT transporters, or [H-3]nisoxetine for NA uptake sites. Increases in [H-3]nisoxetine binding were found in the cingulate, frontal, parietal, agranular insular, entorhinal and perirhinal cortices as well as in the hippocampal divisions CA1, CA3, dentate gyrus and subiculum, and in nucleus raphe dorsalis of trimipramine-treated animals compared to the control rats. Also, densities of NA transporters decreased in temporal cortex, CA2 and nucleus raphe dorsalis in fluoxetine-treated rats as compared to the controls. Also, there was a decrease in NA transporters in the locus coeruleus of the desipramine-treated animals as compared to the densities measured in the control group. Chronic treatment with desipramine or trimipramine, which do not directly inhibit 5-HT uptake, compared to fluoxetine and venlafaxine, lead to increases in 5-HT transporter densities in cingulate, agranular insular and perirhinal cortices. The present study shows differential region-specific effects of antidepressants on 5-HT and NA transporters, leading to distinct consequences in forebrain areas. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

However, the contribution of different regions of the frontal lobe to performance changes has not been clearly established. First, the assessment of sustained attention has not been carried out in patients with lesions that are restricted to cortical regions of the frontal lobe. Second, although sustained attention is often measured by performance on a task requiring effortful attention, it may be more meaningful to measure changes in performance as a function of time-on-task. Two studies were carried out in five groups of subjects: patients with left or right frontal cortical resections, patients with left or right anterior temporal lobe resections, and normal controls. In the first experiment, a brief (4-min) selective attention task was performed. The right frontal group, unlike the other groups, did not show improved reaction times after the first minute on the task. The second experiment involved a long (30-min) shifting attention task. Both the left and right frontal groups were slower than control groups: however, reaction times in the right frontal group increased with time spent on the task. We conclude that the: right frontal cortex plays an essential role in modulating arousal during performance of a task and may also underlie aspects of learning during the early stages of task performance.

Various authors have conceived of this distinction in terms. of the paradigmatic/syntagmatic dissociation, and the connotative and denotative meanings of words, and as reflecting different types of links between words. Drews has suggested that a left-hemisphere lesion would affect the processing of intraconceptual relationships, while a right-hemisphere lesion would impair the processing of interconceptual relationships. The goal of this study was to test this hypothesis, using a number of intra-and interconceptual semantic relationships. Pairs of common words were submitted to left-hemisphere brain-damaged and right-hemisphere brain-damaged subjects. The task required subjects to indicate whether or not there was any relationship between the words. The results only partially support the hypothesis. The right/left opposition applied to only one of three types of intraconceptual relationships (whole-part relation) and to one of two types of interconceptual relationship (same location relation). This partially unexpected result is discussed in reference to other studies. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

More recently, sensory fibre sprouting onto dorsal root ganglion cells has also been observed. Previous work in our laboratory demonstrated persistent sympathetic fibre sprouting in the skin of the rat lower lip following sensory denervation of this region. Therefore, we applied immunocytochemistry to determine the effects of sympathectomies on the terminal fields of sensory fibres. The superior cervical ganglia were removed bilaterally and the effects on the innervation of the skin of the rat lower lip were observed 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 8 weeks post-surgery. Substance P and dopamine-beta -hydroxylase immunoreactivities were used to identify a subset of sensory and sympathetic fibres, respectively. We also assessed neurokinin-1 receptor immunoreactivity. Quantitative data was obtained with the aid of an image analysis system. In controls, the epidermis and upper dermis were innervated by substance P-immunoreactive fibres only and upper dermal blood vessels possessed the highest density of neurokinin-1 receptor immunoreactivity. Blood vessels in the lower dermis were innervated by both substance P- and dopamine-beta -hydroxylase-immunoreactive fibres. Following sympathectomies, substance P-immunoreactive fibres in the epidermis and upper dermis:were more intensely labelled only 1 and 2 weeks post-surgery when compared to sham controls. The length of substance P-immunoreactive fibres in this region was also increased only on the second week. Neurokinin-1 receptor immunoreactivity in the upper dermis was slightly decreased 1 and 2 weeks post-surgery. In the lower dermis, substance P-immunoreactive fibres associated with blood vessels were more intensely labelled only 1 and 2 weeks post-surgery, and at all post-surgical time points studied, blood vessels in this region were devoid of dopamine-beta -hydroxylase-immunoreactive fibres. The length of substance P-immunoreactive fibres was increased from the first to the third week post-surgery in them lower dermis. These results indicate that sympathectomies lead to transient changes in substance P-immunoreactive fibre innervation and neurokinin-1 receptor expression in rat lower lip skin. The effects are most prominent in the lower dermis probably due to a greater local concentration of nerve growth factor in this region. The plasticity of the interactions between sensory and sympathetic fibres may prove important in the regulation of skin microcirculation and in the generation of painful sensations under normal conditions or following peripheral nerve injuries.

Indeed, alteration in these peptides' precursor, their receptors or the hypothalamic neurones that produce them leads to the sleep disorder narcolepsy (Chemelli et al., 1999; Lin et al., 1999; Peyron et al., 2000; Thannickal et al., 2000). The mechanisms by which the orexins modulate wakefulness, however, are still unclear. Their presence in fibres coursing from the hypothalamus (Peyron et al., 1998) up to the preoptic area (POA) and basal forebrain (BF) suggests that they might influence the important sleep and waking neural systems situated there (Jones, 2000). The present study, performed in rat brain slices, demonstrates, however, that the orexins have no effect on the GABA sleep-promoting neurones of the POA, whereas they have a strong and direct excitatory effect on the cholinergic neurones of the contiguous BF. In addition, by comparing the effects of orexin A and B we demonstrate here that orexins' action depends upon orexin type 2 receptors (OX2), which are those lacking in narcoleptic dogs (Lin et al., 1999). These results suggest that the orexins excite cholinergic neurones that release acetylcholine in the cerebral cortex and thereby contribute to the cortical activation associated with wakefulness.

Biochemical studies suggest that RasGRP can activate the Ras signal pathway in response to changes in diacylglycerol and possibly calcium. To investigate potential sites for RasGRP signaling, we have determined the cellular and subcellular localization of RasGRP protein in adult rat hippocampus, and have also examined the appearance of RasGRP mRNA and protein during hippocampal development. RasGRP immunoreactivity is predominately localized to those neurons participating in the direct cortico-hippocampo-cortical loop. In both hippocampal and entorhinal neurons, RasGRP protein appeared to be localized to both dendrites and somata, but not to axons. Electron microscopy of hippocampal pyramidal cells confirmed RasGRP immunoreactivity in neuronal cell bodies and dendrites, where it appeared to be associated with microtubules. The localization of RasGRP to dendrites suggests a role for this pathway in the regulation of dendritic function. Examination of developing hippocampal structures indicated that RasGRP mRNA and protein appear synchronously during the first 2 weeks of postnatal development as these neurons become fully mature. This result indicates that the RasGRP signal transduction pathway is not required during early hippocampal development, but is a feature of mature neurons during the later stages of development.

J	Mechawar, N; Descarries, L				Mechawar, N; Descarries, L			The cholinergic innervation develops early and rapidly in the rat cerebral cortex: A quantitative immunocytochemical study	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						neocortex; acetylcholine; choline acetyltransferase; axons; axon varicosities; innervation	BASAL FOREBRAIN PROJECTIONS; DEVELOPING VISUAL-CORTEX; BLOOD-BRAIN-BARRIER; POSTNATAL-DEVELOPMENT; NICOTINIC ACETYLCHOLINE; TERMINAL FIELDS; SOMATOSENSORY CORTEX; ASCENDING PATHWAYS; NEURONS; ADULT	A recently developed method for determining the length of cholinergic axons and number of cholinergic axon varicosities (terminals) in brain sections immunostained for choline acetyltransferase was used to estimate the areal and laminar densities of the cholinergic innervation in rat frontal (motor), parietal (somatosensory) and occipital (visual) cortex at different postnatal ages. This cortical innervation showed an early beginning, a few immunostained fibers being already present in the cortical subplate at birth. In the first two postnatal weeks, it developed rapidly along three parameters: a progressive increase in the number of varicosities per unit length of axon, and a lengthening and branching of the axons. Between postnatal days 4 and 16, the number of varicosities increased steadily from two to four per 10 mum of cholinergic axon. The mean densities of cholinergic axons increased from 1.4 to 9.6, 1.7 to 9.3 and 0.7 to 7.2 m/mm(3), and the corresponding densities of varicosities from 0.4 to 3.9, 0.4 to 3.5, and 0.2 to 2.6 X 10(6)/mm(3) in the frontal, parietal and occipital areas, respectively. The rate of growth was maximal during these first two weeks, after which the laminar pattern characteristic of each area appeared to be established. Adult Values were almost reached by postnatal day 16 in the parietal cortex, but maturation proceeded further in. them frontal and particularly in the occipital cortex. These quantitative data on the ingrowth and maturation of the cholinergic innervation in postnatal rat cerebral cortex substantiate a role for acetylcholine in the development of this brain region and emphasize the striking growth capacity of individual cholinergic neurons.

J	Manns, ID; Mainville, L; Jones, BE				Manns, ID; Mainville, L; Jones, BE			Evidence for glutamate, in addition to acetylcholine and GABA, neurotransmitter synthesis in basal forebrain neurons projecting to the entorhinal cortex	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						choline acetyltransferase; glutamic acid decarboxylase; phosphate-activated glutaminase; hippocampal region; cholera toxin; retrograde transport	AREA 35 CORTICES; LONG-TERM POTENTIATION; RAT CEREBRAL-CORTEX; CHOLINE-ACETYLTRANSFERASE; HIPPOCAMPAL-FORMATION; ACID DECARBOXYLASE; NUCLEUS BASALIS; RHESUS-MONKEY; INHIBITORY INTERNEURONS; EFFERENT CONNECTIONS	Basal forebrain neurons play important parts in processes of cortical activation and memory that have been attributed to the cortically projecting: cholinergic neurons. Yet, non-cholinergic neurons also project to the cerebral cortex and also appear to participate in processes of cortical modulation and plasticity. GABAergic neurons compose a portion of the cortically projecting cell group, but do not fully account for the non-cholinergic cell contingent. In the present study in the rat. we investigated whether the non-cholinergic, non-GABAergic cell component might be composed of glutamatergic neurons. We examined afferents to the entorhinal cortex. which is known to be modulated by basal forebrain neurons and to be critically involved in memory. Dual immunofluorescent staining was performed for cholera toxin, as retrograde tracer, and phosphate-activated glutaminase, the synthetic enzyme for the neurotransmitter pool of glutamate. The retrogradely labeled cells were distributed across the basal forebrain through the medial septum, diagonal band, magnocellular preoptic area and substantia innominata. The major proportion ( similar to 80%) of the retrogradely labeled cells was found to be immunopositive for phosphate-activated glutaminase. Equal minor proportions (similar to 40%) were immunopositive for choline acety[transferase and glutamic acid decarboxylase. In other material dual-immunostained for neurotransmitter enzymes. similar to 95%, of choline acetyltransferase- and similar to 60% of glutamic acid decarboxylase-immunopositive neurons were also immunopositive for phosphate-activated glutaminase. From these results it appears that a significant proportion of these cell groups, including their cortically projecting contingents, could synthesize glutamate together with acetylcholine or GABA as neurotransmitters and another proportion of cells could synthesize glutamate alone. Accordingly, as either co-transmitter or primary transmitter within basalocortical afferents. glutamate could have the capacity to modulate the entorhinal cortex and promote its role in memory.

We used in vivo microdialysis and high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with electrochemical or fluorometric detection to investigate the concurrent release of dopamine and glutamate in the nucleus accumbens septi and in the ventral tegmental area. as a function of lateral hypothalamic self-stimulation. Self-stimulation at a variety of stimulation frequencies and pulse widths increased levels of dopamine and its primary metabolites, dihydroxyphenylacetic acid and homovanillic acid in the nucleus accumbens. Lateral hypothalamic self-stimulation also induced significant increases in ventral tegmental area dopamine and metabolite levels. and the percentage increase of dopamine was higher in this region than in the nucleus accumbens. Local perfusion with the dopamine uptake inhibitor nomifensine (10 muM) increased dopamine levels in the nucleus accumbens about three-fold and potentiated the increase of dopamine levels induced by self-stimulation. Nomifensine perfusion also induced a delayed decrease in nucleus accumbens glutamate levels, and self-stimulation did not modify this effect of the drug. Local perfusion with the D2-type dopamine receptor antagonist raclopride significantly increased both basal and self-stimulation induced dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens. Neither nomifensine nor raclopride perfusion significantly affected the maximal rates of self-stimulation. Perfusion with tetrodotoxin (2 muM) into nucleus accumbens significantly decreased basal and prevented stimulation-induced increases in accumbens dopamine levels but only slightly decreased the rate of self-stimulation. In contrast, perfusion of tetrodotoxin (0.5 muM) into the ventral tegmental area decreased basal and blocked stimulation-induced increases in both nucleus accumbens and ventral tegmental area dopamine levels; this treatment also blocked or strongly inhibited self-stimulation. While it had no effect on glutamate levels in the nucleus accumbens. lateral hypothalamic self-stimulation induced a significant and tetrodotoxin-sensitive increase in glutamate levels in the ventral segmental area. Taken together, the present results indicate that, across a broad range Of Stimulation parameters, rewarding lateral hypothalamus stimulation causes major and persistent activation of the mesolimbic dopamine system, and suggest descending glutamatergic fibers in the medial forebrain bundle as a candidate for the directly activated descending pathway in lateral hypothalamus brain stimulation reward.

Fos is expressed in two different regions within the suprachiasmatic nucleus. In the ventrolateral, retinorecipient, core region (Leak et al., 1999; Moga and Moore, 1997), Fos is induced by light and expression is closely linked, both temporally and functionally, to clock resetting and entrainment of circadian rhythms (Aronin et al., 1990; Beaule and Amir, 1999; Hastings et al., 1995; Kornhauser et al., 1996; Kornhauser et al., 1990; Rea, 1989, 1998; Rusak et al., 1990; Wollnik et al., 1995). In the dorsomedial shell region (Leak et al., 1999), Fos expression is rhythmic (Guido et al., 1999a,b; Rusak et al., 1992; Sumova and Illnerova, 1998; Sumova et al., 1998). Expression is high during the subjective day when photic sensitivity of the core is minimal, and low in the subjective night, when photic sensitivity of the core is maximal. Although it has been shown that the pattern of Fos expression in the shell tracks the photoperiod (Sumova et al., 2000), nothing is known about whether light influences the expression of Fos in the shell region or about the role of Fos expression in the shell in clock resetting and entrainment. In the present study we found that, in rats maintained in constant darkness, brief exposure to light in the early subjective day or night induced Fos in the core, as expected, and acutely suppressed the levels of Fos immunoreactivity in the shell region. Similar changes in Fos expression in the core and shell regions were seen after exposure to a brief entraining light. Light exposure in the mid-subjective day or night differentially affected Fos expression in the core, as previously shown, but had no effect on Fos expression in the shell region. The finding that Fos expression in the shell region of the suprachiasmatic nucleus is suppressed by light at dawn and dusk suggests a critical role for the shell in photic entrainment of circadian rhythms in nocturnal rodents.

Most recent studies in the neocortex have suggested that acetylcholine acts non-synaptically, however in the present study we provide ultrastructural evidence that suggests synaptic mechanisms prevail. This conclusion is based upon our ultrastructural observations that cholinergic boutons - as revealed by immunoreactivity for the specific cholinergic market, vesicular acetylcholine transporter - establish a high percentage of classical synapses in layer V of the rat parietal cortex. Furthermore, the combination of this approach with the intracellular labeling of large pyramidal neurons on slice preparations revealed significant incidences of cholinergic, contacts abutting preferentially on dendritic shafts. Finally, we have gathered information suggesting that cholinergic boutons undergo atrophy with aging which could be related to the well-known cholinergic and cognitive decline. These results illustrate that the cholinergic terminations in the neocortex establish proper synaptic connections and that they experience important age-dependent atrophy. (C) 2001 IBRO.

Under these experimental conditions, negative or negative-positive field potentials accompanied by rises in [K+](o) (up to 4.1 mM from a baseline of 3.25 mM) occurred spontaneously at intervals of 3-27 s. Both field potentials and [K+], elevations were largest at approximately 1000 mum from the pia. Similar events were induced by neocortical electrical stimuli. Application of medium containing low [Ca2+]/high [Mg2+] (n = 3 slices) antagonism of the GABAA receptor (n = 7) or mu -opioid receptor activation (n = 4) abolished these events. Hence, they represented network, GABA-mediated potentials mainly reflecting the activation of type A receptors following GABA release from interneurons. The GABAB receptor agonist baclofen (10-100 muM, n = 11) reduced and abolished the GABA-mediated potentials (ID50 = 18 muM). Baclofen effects were antagonized by the GABA(B) receptor antagonist CGP 35348 (0.1-1 mM, n = 6; ID50 = 0.19 mM). CGP 38345 application to control medium increased the amplitude of the GABA-mediated potentials and the concomitant [K+](o) rises without modifying their rate of occurrence. The GABA-mediated potentials were not influenced by the broad-spectrum metabotropic glutamate agonist (+/-)-1-aminocyclopentane-trans-1,3-dicarboxylic acid (100 muM, n = 10), but decreased in rate with the group I receptor agonist (S)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine (10-100 muM, n = 9). Our data indicate that human neocortical networks challenged with 4-aminopyridine generate glutamatergic-independent, GABA-mediated potentials that are modulated by mu -opioid and GABAB receptors presumably located on interneuron terminals. These events are associated with [K+](o) elevations that may contribute to interneuron synchronization in the absence of ionotropic excitatory synaptic transmission. (C) 2001 IBRO.

In order to investigate the role of GABA in early development of Forebrain interneurons, we determined the survival of parvalbumin-immunoreactive GABAergic interneurons in the adult rat striatum following prenatal exposure to either GABA(A) receptor agonist or antagonist. Unbiased stereology was used to quantify parvalbumin-immunoreactive neuron number in the neostriatum of adult rats exposed to the drugs in utero. and the results were compared to pair-fed or vehicle controls. Embryos were exposed to the GABA(A) antagonist (bicuculline) or agonist (muscimol) during previously defined proliferative or post-proliferative: periods for parvalbumin-immunoreactive interneurons. Unbiased stereology using the optical fractionator was used to estimate the total number of parvalbumin-immunoreactive neurons in neostriatum of experimental and control rats. No significant alteration in parvalbumin-immunoreactive neuron number was observed in rats treated with either bicuculline (1 or 2 mg/kg/day) or muscimol (1 mg/kg/day) during the proliferative phase. Administration of bicuculline during the post-proliferative phase significantly reduced parvalbumin-immunoreactive neuron number in the neostriatum. A concomitant decrease in neostriatal volume was also observed, suggesting that the effect is not restricted to parvalbumin-immunoreactive interneurons. positional analysis revealed loss of normal regional distribution gradients for parvalbumin-immunoreactive neurons in neostriatum of rats exposed to bicuculline in the embryonic post-proliferative phase. This data collectively suggests that GABA promotes survival but not proliferation of parvalbumin-immunoreactive progenitors.

Many of these effects, such as neurite outgrowth and increased dendritic spine density, are mediated by changes in neuronal cytoskeletal architecture. Since neurofilament proteins play a key role in the maintenance and remodeling of the neuronal cytoskeleton, we postulated that changes in neurofilament light chain mRNA may parallel some of the alterations in neuronal architecture which follow bilateral ovariectomy. We measured neurofilament light chain mRNA levels using a ribonuclease protection assay at two time-points after ovariectomy in mature female rats. One week after ovariectomy, neurofilament light chain mRNA levels (corrected for glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA) did not differ from sham-operated animals in the five brain regions examined (hypothalamus, striatum, hippocampus, frontal cortex and occipital cortex). Four months after ovariectomy, neurofilament light chain mRNA levels were similarly unchanged in the hypothalamus and striatum. In contrast, statistically significant increases in neurofilament light chain mRNA expression were observed in the three regions receiving basal forebrain projections (hippocampus, frontal cortex and occipital cortex). rn situ hybridization demonstrated increases in neurofilament light chain mRNA expression involving subpopulations of smaller medial septal neurons. There also appeared to be an increased number of larger septal neurons following long-term ovariectomy. We propose that atrophic changes involving basal forebrain projection fibers are followed by compensatory axonal growth by other 'intact' basal forebrain neurons. Increased neurofilament light chain mRNA expression and somatic hypertrophy in medial septal neurons may both be reflective of the need to sustain an axonal network which is larger and more complex. In contrast, increased neurofilament light chain mRNA expression observed in basal forebrain targets following long-term ovariectomy may be reflective of compensatory changes taking place in local neurons.

Recent in vitro electrophysiological studies have shown that rat entorhinal cortex layer V cells are endowed with the ability to generate subthreshold oscillations and all-or-none, low-threshold depolarizing potentials. In the present study, by applying current-clamp, voltage-clamp and single-channel recording techniques in rat slices and dissociated neurons, we investigated whether entorhinal cortex layer V cells express a persistent sodium current and sustained sodium channel activity to evaluate the contribution of this activity to the subthreshold behavior of the cells. Sharp-electrode recording in slices demonstrated that layer V cells display tetrodotoxin-sensitive inward rectification in the depolarizing direction, suggesting that a persistent sodium current is present in the cells. Subthreshold oscillations and low-threshold regenerative events were also abolished by tetrodotoxin, suggesting that their generation also requires the activation of such a low-threshold sodium current. The presence of a persistent sodium current was confirmed in whole-cell voltage-clamp experiments, which revealed that its activation "threshold" was negative by about 10 mV to that of the transient sodium current. Furthermore, stationary noise analysis and cell-attached, patch-clamp recordings indicated that whole-cell persistent sodium currents were mediated by persistent sodium channel activity, consisting of relatively high-conductance (similar to 18 pS) sustained openings. The presence of a persistent sodium current in entorhinal cortex layer V cells can cause the generation of oscillatory behavior, bursting activity and sustained discharge; this might be implicated in the encoding of memories in which the entorhinal cortex participates but, under pathological situations, may also contribute to epileptogenesis and neurodegeneration.

J	Preul, MC; Feindel, W				Preul, MC; Feindel, W			A history of brain imaging technology in neurosurgery	NEUROSURGERY CLINICS OF NORTH AMERICA			English	Article							PAST	In the closing decades of the nineteenth century, diagnosis of cerebral lesions was based on the clinical examination, and often the localization and operative approaches were based on observation of seizures. The attribution of certain symptoms and signs to dysfunction arising at an identifiable focal point in the brain was the basis for clinicopathologic correlation and rational treatment. As beautiful as brain anatomy was and as skillful as clinical examination could be, there was no means to produce images of a living patient that could be used to diagnose and treat that same patient. On November 8, 1895, all of this changed with Wilhelm Rontgen's discovery of X-rays. This article aims to elucidate seminal points in the history of medical imaging as applied to the brain that have had a major impact on neurosurgery.

In showing that adaptation to textures modulated around one orientation shifts the perceived location of textures modulated around a different orientation, we demonstrate the existence of a neural code for the location of orientation change that generalises across orientation content. Using competitive adaptation, we characterise the neural processes underlying this code as single-opponent for orientation, that is with concentric excitatory/inhibitory receptive areas tuned to a single orientation.

Restoring urinary functions allows voluntary bladder voiding, and reduces or even suppresses hyperreflexia. The preliminary stimulation system is composed of subcutaneous implantable stimulators (an implant) and an external device. The implant includes the selective stimulation for bladder voiding, in addition to a new permanent stimulation technique to reduce (or cancel) the bladder hyperreflexia and so cures other related diseases. Permanent stimulation is a low frequency, low amplitude and all day long stimulation that needs to be battery powered. On the other hand, selective stimulation is a bi-frequency, punctual, precise and at a higher amplitude stimulation that is well controlled and powered from the outside. Eight prototypes of the stimulator have been used in an experimental evaluation in dogs to characterize the reliability and functionality of the new implant in a real application environment. Preliminary results of the study show that the proposed stimulation system and the stimulation strategy provide significant improvement for bladder hyperreflexia curing while it confirmed the efficiency of the selective stimulation by means of high frequency blockage.

Bulimic, impulsive and depressive syndromes have all been associated with abnormalities in brain serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) mechanisms. Methods. We had 26 bulimic women and 22 normal-eater women report impulsive, affective, self-destructive and bulimic symptoms, and then provide serial blood samples for measurement of: [3H]-paroxetine binding in platelets; and, prolactin (PRL) responses following oral meta-chlorophenyl-piperazine (m-CPP). Results. Bulimic status was associated with markedly reduced density of paroxetine-binding sites, modest blunting of m-CPP stimulated PRL response, and greater nausea following m-CPP. Biological variables did not co-vary with most psychopathological or eating-symptom indices. However: there were inverse associations (in bulimic women only) between scores indicating impulsivity (largely 'unreflectiveness') and density of platelet 5-HT uptake sites. Conclusions. Our observations link bulimia nervosa to altered 5-HT functioning, and suggest that there may be a relatively symptom-specific association between impulsivity and reduced 5-HT reuptake.

Thus after two ACh molecules bind and open the channel, a third molecule enters and blocks the pore at a site resembling that for block by local anesthetics, suggesting that ACh is the endogenous anesthetic of the NMJ. Recovery from open channel block results in a rebound synaptic current only after ACh is cleared from the cleft. Kinetic modeling of other AChRs suggests that a rebound current is generated at all vertebrate NMJs, from fish to frogs to mammals. Open channel block prolongs the current at fast zebrafish NMJs in order to more effectively spread charge along the fibers, akin to multiple central synapses spread over dendrites. Together these findings indicate the need for a fundamental revision of current thinking about neuromuscular transmission at many levels, including channel structure, function and pharmacology.

There are, however, intriguing reports that this agent may also have other beneficial clinical effects on symptoms associated with, or occurring independently of, Parkinson's disease. It has been shown that depression, which is a frequent accompaniment of Parkinson's disease, may not necessarily be simply an emotional reaction to the parkinsonian symptoms but could be aetiopathotogically linked to the same underlying dopaminergic mechanisms. There is evidence that pramipexole can alleviate mild-to-moderate depression, whether or not this occurs in association with Parkinson's disease. Such findings may throw interesting new light on the involvement of dopaminergic processes in depressive illness. Pramipexole may also have an antianxiety potential, though currently it is not clear whether this is secondary to, or independent of, its antidepressive actions. Although some studies have been conducted on possible antischizophrenic effects of pramipexole, these have generally been small and have either given negative results or have suggested that the treatment may alleviate negative schizophrenic symptoms, with effects on positive symptoms being less evident. Pramipexole is a potent treatment for restless legs syndrome (RLS), a dose of 0.375-0.75 mg/day producing complete relief of symptoms in the majority of cases. Other conditions in which pramipexole might be expected to produce some clinical improvements include attention-deficit-hyperactivity disorder, sexual impotence in males, cocaine addiction, and supranuclear palsy, though no direct evidence currently exists to support any of these putative applications. Exploration of the profile of clinical effectiveness of pramipexole may be expected to throw interesting new light on the interrelationships between a range of neurological and neuropsychiatric conditions.

Pain is often reported as a symptom of CI and it is defined as a subjective experience similar to many other symptoms of CI, making its objectification difficult. Furthermore, the CNS plastic changes that underlie the development of persistent pain states and abnormal pain responses may share some similarities with those involved in the sensitization to environmental chemicals. Functional brain imaging studies in humans demonstrate that acute pain evoked by nociceptive stimulation is accompanied by the activation of a widely distributed network of cerebral structures, including the thalamus and the somatosensory, insular, and anterior cingulate cortices. Abnormal activity within these regions has been associated with the experience of pain following damage to the peripheral or central nervous system (neuropathic pain) in a number of clinical populations. In normal individuals, activity within this network is correlated with subjective pain perception, is highly modifiable by cognitive interventions such as hypnosis and attention, and has been associated with emotions. Other cognitive mediators such as expectations can also produce robust changes in pain perception (e.g., in placebo analgesia). These effects likely depend on both higher-order cerebral structures and descending mechanisms modulating spinal nociceptive activity. These psychological processes can be solicited to reduce clinical pain and we speculate that they may further attenuate or promote central mechanisms involved in the transition from acute to persistent pain states. The investigation of central determinants of subjective experience is essential to assess the possibility that higher-order brain/psychological processes modulate and/or mediate the development of persistent pain states. These factors may contribute to the development of symptoms in CI.

The amount of pain perceived, moreover, is assumed to be directly proportional to the extent of injury. Recent research, however, indicates far more complex mechanisms. Clinical and experimental evidence shows that noxious stimuli may sensitize central neural structures involved in pain perception. Salient clinical examples of these effects include amputees with pains in a phantom limb that are similar or identical to those felt in the limb before it was amputated, and patients after surgery who have benefited from preemptive analgesia which blocks the surgery-induced afferent barrage and/or its central consequences. Experimental evidence of these changes is illustrated by the development of sensitization, wind-up, or expansion of receptive fields of CNS neurons, as well as by the enhancement of flexion reflexes and the persistence of pain or hyperalgesia after inputs from injured tissues are blocked. It is clear from the material presented that the perception of pain does not simply involve a moment-to-moment analysis of afferent noxious input, but rather involves a dynamic process that is influenced by the effects of past experiences. Sensory stimuli act on neural systems that have been modified by past inputs, and the behavioral output is significantly influenced by the "memory" of these prior events. An increased understanding of the central changes induced by peripheral injury or noxious stimulation should lead to new and improved clinical treatment for the relief and prevention of pathological pain.

It provides a possibility to make self-locking, -expanding and -compressing implants. As porous NiTi has elastic modulus near the bone tissue, it may also be a appropriate candidate as a bone substitute material. Theoretically, biocompatibility problems may arise because of high nickel content of NiTi. To estimate the in vivo biocompatibility it is essential to do testing and analyzing in different tissues as the environmental conditions (pH, electrolytes, protein composition etc.) inside the human body vary a lot. When certain specific applications are concern the biomechanical questions are also of great interest. The overall inflammatory response and the encapsule membrane thickness around to Nitinol in recent studies have been found to be similar to that of stainless steel (StSt) and Ti-6Al-4V alloy. So far, there has been no reports of tissue necroses, granulomas, or signs of dystrophic soft tissue clacification in vivo. The general immune cell response to Nitinol has been found to remain low also during a long term implantation. The characteristics of muscular tissue response to NiTi are nontoxic, nearly inert. Muscle tissue response to porous NiTi has been found to exhibited a thin, tightly adherent fibrous capsules with fibers penetrating into implant pores. The neural and perineural responses reported are nontoxic and nonirritating after NiTi implantation. Nitinol wire might be a very promising new tendon suture material because of high strength comparing the conventional materials. The biocompatibility of NiTi in tendon tissue is excellent. NiTi has no negative effect on new bone formation and the bone contact to NiTi has been found to be very close, indicating good tissue tolerance, The osteotomy healing with porous NiTi has also found to be good. A typical bone remodeling, characterized by normal osteoclastic and osteoblastic activity has been reported. After long term implantation no difference in nickel concentration between the NiTi and StSt groups has been found in any of the distant organs, The surface corrosion changes of retrieved NiTi implants were minimal. Based on the published studies, NiTi appears to have good potential for clinical use as its biocompatibility also in vivo is good. When NiTi is intended to be used in long-term implants, for example vascular stents, optimal surface treatment must consider.

The ultimate goal is to realize intelligent and transparent communications between human beings and machines. The neural network (NN) based recognition methods have been found to be particularly promising, since NN is capable of implementing mapping from the feature space of face images to the facial expression space. However, finding a proper network size has always been a frustrating and time consuming experience for NN developers. In this paper, we propose to use the constructive one-hidden-layer feedforward neural networks (OHL-FNNs) to overcome this problem. The constructive OHL-FNN will obtain in a systematic way a proper network size which is required by the complexity of the problem being considered. Furthermore, the computational cost involved in network training can be considerably reduced when compared to standard back-propagation (BP) based FNNs. In our proposed technique, the 2-dimensional discrete cosine transform (2-D DCT) is applied over the entire difference face image for extracting relevant features for recognition purpose. The lower-frequency 2-D DCT coefficients obtained are then used to train a constructive OHL-FNN. An input-side pruning technique previously proposed by the authors is also incorporated into the constructive learning process to reduce the network size without sacrificing the performance of the resulting network. The proposed technique is applied to a database consisting of images of 60 men, each having 5 facial expression images (neutral, smile, anger, sadness, and surprise). Images of 40 men are used for network training, and the remaining images are used for generalization and testing. Confusion matrices calculated in both network training and testing for 4 facial expressions (smile, anger, sadness, and surprise) are used to evaluate the performance of the trained network. By extensive simulations it is shown that when compared with the BP-based method, the proposed technique constructs OHL-FNN with significantly smaller number of hidden units and weights, and simultaneously yielding improved recognition performance.

In the first step, segmentation is done according to the structural features between the connected components in the legal amounts. In the second step, a feedback process is introduced to re-segment the parts that could not be identified in the first step. Then a multiple neural network classifier is used to verify the re-segmentation result. The confidence value produced by the classifier is used to determine the best segmentation points. This approach is tested on a new CENPARMI database and the result indicates that the correct segmentation rate increased by 13.4% from the previous approach.

Universal agreement on concussion definition and severity grading does not exist. Grading systems represent expertise of clinicians and researchers yet scientific evidence is lacking. Most used loss of consciousness and post-traumatic amnesia as markers for grading concussion. Although in severe head injury these parameters may have been proven important for prognosis, no study has done the same for sport-related concussion. Post-concussion symptoms are often the main features to help in the diagnosis of concussion in sport. Neuropsychological testing is meant to help physicians and health professionals to have objective indices of some of the neurocognitive symptoms. It is the challenge of physicians, therapists and coaches involved in the care of athletes to know the symptoms of concussion, recognise them when they occur and apply basic, neuropsychological testing to help detect this injury. It is, therefore, recommended to be familiar with one grading system and use it consistently, even though it may not be scientifically validated. Then good clinical judgement and the ability to recognise post-concussion signs and symptoms will assure that an athlete never returns to play while symptomatic.

Understanding the predictors of cost provides an efficient means of incorporating such information in decision-making concerning new therapies. Methods-Data from two 12-week multinational trials that collected information on a variety of neurological, functional, and cost parameters for 1341 ischemic stroke patients were examined by means of multiple linear regression. Because the intent is for the model to be predictive, only patient characteristics that can be known at the time of patient presentation or shortly thereafter were evaluated for inclusion in the model Results - The Barthel Index was the strongest predictor of cost in all models evaluated. Other major predictors, either directly or through their impact on survival, were stroke subtype, neurological impairment, congestive heart failure, and country. A good model fit was obtained, judging by the model statistics (model F=84, 3 df, P<0.0001) and the accuracy of the predictions (<3% difference between mean actual and predicted cost). Conclusions-Through the use of key patient characteristics, this regression model allows for prediction of the cost of stroke care, which may be helpful in the context of therapeutic decisions and budgetary planning purposes. It also provides insight into how specific treatments? through their impact on clinical characteristics, can modify the cost of stroke treatment.

The reason is that 95% of this class of pipes is too small for effective manual (i.e. walk-in) inspection. The need to assess the condition of sewer pipes gave rise to the development of new techniques for inspection. In an effort to develop new techniques, the closed circuit television (CCTV) camera was first introduced in the 1960s. The process of manual CCTV inspection is usually time consuming, tedious and expensive. It may also lead to diagnostic errors due to lack of concentration of human inspectors. This paper briefly describes a recently developed inspection system that detects and classifies defects automatically in sewer pipes, and focuses primarily on presenting an effective computer-based model, designed to verify the output of the developed system.

However, in addition to direct inputs from vestibular afferents, the vestibular nuclei receive substantial projections from cortical, cerebellar, and other brainstem structures. Given this diversity of inputs, the question arises: How are the responses of vestibular nuclei neurons to head velocity modified by these additional inputs during naturally occurring behaviors? Here we have focused on the signal processing done by two specific classes of neurons in the vestibular nuclei: (1) position-vestibular-pause (PVP) neurons that mediate the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR), and (2) vestibular-only (VO) neurons that are thought to mediate, at least in part, the vestibulo-collic reflex (VCR). We first characterized neuronal responses to passive rotation in the head-restrained condition, and then released the head to record the discharges of the same neurons during self-generated head movements. VOR interneurons (i.e., PVP neurons) faithfully transmitted head velocity signals when the animal stabilized its gaze, regardless of whether the head motion was actively or passively generated; their responses were attenuated only when the monkey's behavioral goal was to redirect its axis of gaze relative to space. In contrast, VCR interneurons (i.e., VO neurons) faithfully transmitted head velocity signals during passive head motion, but their responses were greatly (and similarly) attenuated during all behaviors (i.e., gaze shifts, gaze pursuit, gaze stabilization) during which the monkey's behavioral goal was to move its head relative to the body. To characterize the mechanism(s) that underlie this differential processing, we tested neurons during passive rotation of the head relative to the body, as well as during a task in which a monkey actively "drove" both its head and body together in space. We conclude that neither passive activation of neck proprioceptors nor knowledge of self-generated head-in-space motion directly mediate the observed reductions in head-velocity-related modulation. Instead, we propose that the VOR and VCR pathways use efference copies of oculomotor and neck movement commands, respectively, for the differential processing of vestibular information.

The ultimate goal is to realize intelligent man-machine interface. Recently, constructive One-Hidden-Layer Feedforward Neural Networks (OHL-FNNs) have been found promising for facial expression recognition. The hidden units in a FNN usually have the same activation functions typically selected as sigmoidal functions. However, it has not been proven that the use of the same activation functions for all the hidden units is the best or optimal choice in terms of network performance. In this paper, a new constructive polynomial OHL-FNN is proposed for pattern recognition. The well-known Hermite polynomials will be used as activation functions for the hidden units. Each time a new hidden unit is to be added to the net-work, a Hermite polynomial whose order is increased by one will be used as the activation function of the hidden unit. The proposed technique is applied to the facial expression recognition problem where the 2-D DCT is performed over the entire face image before the resulting lower 2-D DCT coefficients are fed to the constructive network training. The advantages and limitations of the constructive polynomial OHL-FNN for pattern recognition are also discussed.

In recent years, it has been proposed that thalamic nuclei may actively participate in the processing of specific information in conjunction with cortical areas. In support of this hypothesis, we recently discovered that neurons in the main extrageniculate visual nucleus, the pulvinar, exhibit higher-order visual properties that were, until now, only associated with higher-order cortical areas. Pulvinar neurons can indeed code the veridical direction of a moving plaid pattern, indicating that these cells can integrate ambiguous signals into a coherent percept. This finding as well as our demonstration that there are cortico-thalamo-cortical loops involved in complex motion analysis open promising avenues in unraveling the function of the pulvinar complex in normal vision.

The level of spared visual functions or residual vision(1) depends on the extent and location of the lesion as well as the age at which the trauma occurs. For instance, in primate as well as non-primate species, it is well established that lesions in adulthood have a more profound effect than those occurring in young animals. The recovery of visually guided behavior observed after massive destruction of the occipital cortex in young animals across many species has been generally associated with the reorganization of the pathways from the extrageniculate thalamus to the spared visual cortex, i.e. the extrastriate areas. In this chapter, we present some evidence that the lateral posterior-pulvinar (LP-pulvinar) complex may contribute to maintaining visual capacities in brain-damaged cats. Our data indicate that the overall visual responsiveness of the lateral part of the LP (LPI) cells is not altered by the early removal of the visual cortex. However, some specific properties differ from those of intact animals: on average, LPI neurons in brain-damaged animals are more broadly tuned for orientation than that in intact cats. Spatial frequency tuning functions are also affected since most units in lesioned animals are of the low-pass type. Moreover, most LPI cells of lesioned cats responded to drifting gratings with modulated discharges and a linear spatial summation within their receptive field, a characteristic that is infrequently observed in intact animals. The change in LPI response properties observed in the present study is likely to come from the reorganization of cortical and retinal fibers reaching this extrageniculate nucleus.

The SC has also been implicated in fixation control. In a current hypothesis, activity on the SC motor map reflects two conflictual behavioral states: 'Orient!' versus 'Don't orient!' The latter behavior is thought to be commanded from a 'fixation zone' in the rostral SC that includes the foveal representation of the retinotopic map. 'Fixation neurons' (SCFNs) in this zone project to brainstem 'omnipause neurons' (OPNs) that inhibit the gaze-saccade generating circuits. It has been proposed that activity in SCFNs during active fixation, drives OPNs which in turn inhibit the gaze saccade generator, thereby maintaining the visual axis stable on a target of interest. Cats with head unrestrained frequently orient in the dark, to a briefly visible target, using multiple-step gaze shifts with a variable number of gaze saccades interspersed with periods of steady fixation. We found that SCFNs are not always active during the inter-step fixation periods when the visual axis is immobile - whereas OPNs are tonically active - thereby implying that activity in FNs and OPNs can be decoupled. In cats with head unrestrained, SCFNs encode the error between desired and actual gaze positions, not necessarily that the visual axis is immobile. By comparison, OPNs are tonically active when the visual axis is immobile, but some also encode gaze position error. Thus, the discharge of an OPN may reflect combined inputs from SCFNs combined with a steady bias.

Here we provide a brief overview of visual cortical processing of second-order stimuli, as well as some comparative background on first-order processing, concentrating on single-unit neurophysiology, but also discussing relationships to human psychophysics and to neuroimaging. The selectivity of visual cortical neurons to orientation, spatial frequency, and direction of movement of first-order, luminance-defined stimuli is conventionally understood in terms of simple linear filter models, albeit with some minor nonlinearities such as thresholding and gain control. However, these kinds of models fail entirely to account for responses of neurons to second-order stimuli such as contrast envelopes, illusory contours, or texture borders. Second-order stimuli constructed from sinusoidal components have been used to analyze the neurophysiological mechanisms of such responses; these experiments demonstrate that the same neuron can exhibit three distinct kinds of tuning to spatial frequency, and also to orientation. These results can be understood in terms of a type of nonlinear 'filter --> rectify --> filter' model, which has been widely used in human psychophysics. Finally, several general issues will be discussed, including potential artifacts in experiments with second-order stimuli, and strategies for avoiding or controlling for them; caveats about definitions of first- vs. second-order mechanisms and stimuli; the concept of form-cue invariance; and the functional significance of second-order processing.

How does visual motion analysis contribute to behavioral stability? To approach this question, we rely on current knowledge about heading perception and coherent motion extraction from animated random dot displays. This chapter presents psychophysical evidence for an asymmetry in the global visual decomposition of the retinal motion flow. We examined the ability of human observers to identify the radial and the parallel flow component in displays where the two motions were transparently superimposed. Whereas sensitivity to the radial motion remained unaffected by the presence of parallel flow, sensitivity to the latter was greatly degraded in the presence of radial flow. This imbalance was observed within the first 200 ms of motion exposure, prior to the perception of heading (430 ms; Hooge et al. (1999) Exp. Brain Res., 129: 615-628). Although such an asymmetrical masking is well suited to minimize heading errors, whether it really contributes to the extraction of behavioral direction remains an open question.

For over 25 years now, evidence has been accumulating that hemianopic human subjects and monkeys possess wide-ranging residual visual capacities or 'blindsight' in the blind part of their visual field. For some researchers, isolated islands of the striate cortex have been associated with patches of degraded vision and made responsible for blindsight. Artefacts such as light scatter, criterion effects, macular sparing, eccentric fixation and minute eye movements have also been linked with the residual vision. For others, the fact that certain aspects of the visual information can be processed without the geniculostriate pathway suggests mediation by the visual subsystems such as extrastriate visual cortical areas which receive visual information via subcortical pathways, that escaped the cortical damage. Subjects who have had a whole cerebral hemisphere removed or disconnected (for the treatment of uncontrollable epilepsy) and who show residual vision in their blind field offer a remarkable opportunity to help clear the controversy regarding the neural substrate of blindsight. Because it is certain that no functional striate or extrastriate cortex remains on the ablated side, these subjects have contributed significantly to identifying the critical pathways involved in blindsight.

We have shown that the retinogenigulate pathway undergoes severe degenerative changes in hemispherectomized monkeys, greater than those shown in cats and we proposed that remaining retinal terminals to the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus have little potential for conveying visual information any further. All subdivisions of the pulvinar undergo severe degeneration following hemispherectomy showing that the ascending tectofugal pathway is also shut off. On the other hand, the retina subserving the blind field is not depleted of ganglion cells which still send normal appearing terminals to the midbrain pretectum and superior colliculus. Visual information from the blind hemifield can thus gain access to the brain and could potentially reach the contralateral cerebral cortex through the midbrain commissure and possibly through thalamic commissural cells.

The surgically induced retino-thalamo-cortical pathways can mediate visual guided behaviors whose normal substrate, the pathway from the retina to the primary visual cortex via the primary thalamic visual nucleus, is missing. The visually evoked response properties of A1 neurons resemble in many respects those of neurons in V1 of normal hamsters: many A1 neurons have well-defined visual receptive fields and preferences for orientation or direction of movement. In addition, some visually responsive cells in A1 aide bimodal - they also respond to auditory stimuli. The visually responsive neurons in A1 probably account for the capacity of the auditory cortex to mediate visual behavior in 'rewired hamsters'.

The function of the truncated TrkB isoforms is unclear and to gain insights into their function, we have isolated a protein from 15N neuroblastoma cells that specifically binds the TrkB.T1 isoform, Pulldown experiments using a GST fusion protein containing the TrkB.T1 intracellular domain identified a 61 kDa protein from radiolabeled 15N lysates. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments showed that the 61 kDa protein interacted with epitope-tagged TrkB.T1 overexpressed in 15N cells as well as with TrkB.T1 which was endogenously expressed. Peptide competition experiments revealed that the protein, designated TTIP (for Truncated TrkB Interacting Protein), showed specific binding to the TrkB.T1 tail. Mauldi MS and MS/MS analysis has revealed that TTIP is a novel protein not Set listed in the current databases. (C) 2000 Academic Press.

Efficient processing of PC1 substrates in granules requires a mechanism that will both limit the activity of the enzyme to these organelles and promote its targeting to the nascent secretory granules. In the current study, we provide evidence that targeting of PC1 to secretory granules is mediated by alpha -helical structures in its C-terminal tail and, at least in part, is dependent on interactions with specific components of the secretory granule membrane.

Concussion victims showed a striking decrease in P300 amplitude, an effect presumed to reflect alterations in attentional-cognitive processes. Moreover, the degree of impairment was strongly related to the severity of post-concussion symptoms. Our data suggest that concussions cause objectively measurable changes in the electrophysiological markers of brain activity and hence in the functions of the structures from which they originate. ERPs may thus constitute a reliable method to accurately monitor the clinical course and recovery of head injuries in athletes. NeuroReport 11:4087-4092 (C) 2000 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

We have identified two alternative exons 1 by RACE analysis from a human neuroectodermal tumor. Exons la and Ib are located respectively 1.3 and 2.5 kb upstream from the published exon 1. Translation of these alternative messengers is predicted to generate very similar proteins. The sequence upstream from exon Ib showed functional promoter activity. Exon Ib was not conserved in the mouse but was detected in every analyzed human cell, whereas exon la was present only in a subset of them and also in various mouse cell lines. These results suggest that both mouse and human Fli-1 gene expression might be under the control of several independent promoter regions. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Block of GABA(A) receptors in neocortex transforms cortical slow-wave oscillations into large-amplitude similar to1 Hz discharges consisting of a negative spike or multiple negative spikes riding on a positive wave. Further block of GABA(B) receptors in neocortex slows the discharges to similar to0.5 Hz and increments the number of negative spikes forming rhythmic similar to 10 Hz neocortical oscillations. Although the thalamus responds robustly to these neocortical discharges, these are unaffected by thalamic inactivation using tetrodotoxin. Thus, an important problem relates to the origin of these activities within the neocortex. Current source density analysis and intracellular recordings revealed that the first negative spike in a discharge corresponded to a current sink that reflected a paroxysmal depolarizing shift (PDS) and could originate in the lower layers or in the upper layers. Regardless of the origin (upper or lower layer), the initial current sink always spreads to the same site in upper layer V-IV. In contrast, the similar to 10 Hz oscillation that follows the initial negative spike corresponds to current sinks that always originate in the lower layers but do not spread to upper layer V-IV, jumping directly to the upper layers. Each current sink in the similar to 10 Hz oscillation reflects a small PDS and is followed by a current source that reflects the repolarization after each PDS.

It is essential for stimulating cortical activation in association with waking (and paradoxical sleep), yet also important for attenuating cortical activation and promoting slow wave sleep. Using juxtacellular recording and labeling of neurons with Neurobiotin followed by immunohistochemical staining for glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), we studied the discharge properties of identified GABAergic basal forebrain neurons in relation to electroencephalographic (EEG) activity in urethane-anesthetized rats to determine the part or parts that they may play in this dual role. The GABAergic neurons displayed distinct discharge profiles in relation to somatosensory stimulation-evoked cortical activation. Whereas a significant minority increased its average discharge rate, the majority decreased its average discharge rate in association with cortical activation. Moreover, subgroups displayed distinct discharge patterns related to different cortical activities, including very regular high-frequency tonic spiking within a gamma EEG frequency range and rhythmic cluster spiking within a theta-like frequency range during cortical activation. During irregular slow EEG activity in absence of stimulation, one subgroup displayed spike bursts correlated with cortical slow oscillations. As relatively large in size and also antidromically activated from the cortex, many GABAergic neurons recorded were considered to be cortically projecting and thus capable of directly modulating cortical activity. Subgroups of GABAergic basal forebrain neurons would thus have the capacity to promote cortical activation by modulating gamma or theta activity and others to attenuate cortical activation by modulating irregular slow oscillations that normally occur during slow wave sleep.

In the present study, using receptor binding assays and immunocytochemistry, we evaluated the pharmacological profile of insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) receptors and the distribution of IGF-I immunoreactivity in the frontal cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum of AD and age-matched control brains. In control brains, [I-125]IGF-I binding was inhibited more potently by IGF-I than by Des(1-3)IGF-I, IGF-II or insulin. The IC50 values for IGF-I in the frontal cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum of the normal brain did not differ significantly from the corresponding regions of the AD brain. Additionally, neither K-D nor B-max values were found to differ in the hippocampus of AD brains from the controls. At the regional levels, [I-125]IGF-I binding sites in the AD brain also remained unaltered compared to the controls. As for the peptide itself, IGF-I immunoreactivity, in normal control brains, was evident primarily in a subpopulation of astrocytes in the frontal cortex and hippocampus, and in certain Purkinje cells of the cerebellum. In AD brains, a subset of A beta -containing neuritic plaques, apart from astrocytes, exhibit IGF-I immunoreactivity. These results, taken together, suggest a role for ICF-I in compensatory plasticity and/or survival of the susceptible neurons in AD brains. (C) 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

The number of ACh varicosities per length of axon (4 per 10 mum) appeared constant in the different layers and areas. The mean density of ACh axons was the highest in the frontal cortex (13.0 m/mm(3) vs. 9.9 and 11.0 m/mm(3) in the somatosensory and visual cortex, respectively), as was the mean density of ACh varicosities (5.4 x 10(6)/mm(3) vs. 3.8 and 4.6 x 10(6)/mm(3)). In all three areas, layer I displayed the highest laminar densities of ACh axons and varicosities (e.g., 13.5 m/mm(3) and 5.4 x 10(6)/mm(3) in frontal cortex). The lowest were those of layer TV in the parietal cortex (7.3 m/mm(3) and 2.9 x 10(6)/mm(3)). The lengths of ACh axons under a 1 mm(2) surface of cortex were 26.7, 19.7, and 15.3 m in the frontal, parietal, and occipital areas, respectively, for corresponding numbers of 11.1, 7.7, and 6.4 x 10(6) ACh varicosities. In the parietal cortex, this meant a total of 1.2 x 10(6) synaptic ACh varicosities under a 1 mm(2) surface, 48% of which in layer V alone, according to previous electron microscopic estimates of synaptic incidence. In keeping with the notion that the synaptic component of ACh transmission in cerebral cortex is preponderant in layer V, these quantitative data suggest a role for this innervation in the processing of cortical output as well as input. Extrapolation of particular features of this system in terms of total axon length and number of varicosities in whole cortex, length of axons and number of varicosities per cortically projecting neuron, and concentration of ACh per axon varicosity, should also help in arriving at a better definition of its roles and functional properties in cerebral cortex.

We show that induction of endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) by an increase in prostaglandins (PGs) contributes to the secondary CBF increase during hypercapnic acidosis. Ventilation of Digs with 6% CO2 (Paco(2 approximate to)65 mm Hg; pH approximate to 7.2) caused a approximate to 2.5-fold increase in CBF at 30 minutes, which declined to basal values at 3 hours and gradually rose again at 6 and 8 hours; the latter increase was associated with PG elevation, nitrite formation, eNOS mRNA expression, and in situ NO synthase (NOS) reactivity (NADPH-diaphorase staining). Subjecting free-floating brain sections to acidotic conditions increased eNOS expression, the time course of which was: similar to that of CBF increase. Treatment of Dib's with the cyclooxygenase inhibitor diclofenac or the NOS inhibitor N-omega-nitro-L-arginine blunted thc initial rise and prevented the secondary CBF increase during hypercapnic acidosis; neuronal NOS blockers 1-(2-trifluoromethylphenyl) imidazole and 3-bromo-7-nitroindazole were ineffective. Diclofenac abolished the hypercapnia-induced rise in cerebrovascular nitrite production, eNOS mRNA expression, and NADPH-diaphorase reactivity. Acidosis (pH approximate to 7.15, Pco(2 approximate to)40 mm Hg; 6 hours) produced similar increases in prostaglandin E-2 (PGE(2)) and eNOS mRNA levels in isolated brain microvessels and in NADPH-diaphorase reactivity of brain microvasculature; these changes were prevented by diclofenac, by the receptor-operated Ca2+ channel blocker SK&F96365, and by the K-ATP channel blocker glybenclamide. Acidosis increased Ca2+ transients in brain endothelial cells, which were blocked by glybenclamide and SK&F96365 but not by diclofenac, Increased PG-related eNOS mRNA and NO-dependent vasorelaxation to substance P was detected as well in rat brain exposed to 6 hours of hypercapnia, PGE, was the only major prostanoid that modulated brain eNOS expression during acidosis. Thus, in prolonged hypercapnic acidosis, the secondary CBF rise is closely associated with induction of eNOS expression; this seems to be mediated by PGE(2) generated by a K-ATP and Ca2+ channel-dependent process.

Using positron emission tomography, we report cerebral blood flow activity in profoundly deaf signers processing specific aspects of sign language in key brain sites widely assumed to be unimodal speech or sound processing areas: the left inferior frontal cortex when signers produced meaningful signs, and the planum temporale bilaterally when they viewed signs or meaningless parts of signs (sign-phonetic and syllabic units). Contrary to prevailing wisdom, the planum temporale may not be exclusively dedicated to processing speech sounds, but may be specialized for processing more abstract properties essential to language that can engage multiple modalities. We hypothesize that the neural tissue involved in language processing may not be prespecified exclusively by sensory modality (such as sound) but may entail polymodal neural tissue that has evolved unique sensitivity to aspects of the patterning of natural language. Such neural specialization for aspects of language patterning appears to be neurally unmodifiable in so far as languages with radically different sensory modalities such as speech and sign are processed at similar brain sites, while, at the same time, the neural pathways for expressing and perceiving natural language appear to be neurally highly modifiable.

The aim of this study was to use resistive load breathing as a stimulus to the cardiorespiratory interaction and to examine the extent of the changes in heart rate variability (HRV) and respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) in relation to the breathing pattern changes. HRV and RSA were studied in seven healthy subjects where four resistive loads were applied in a random order during the breath and 8-min recording made in each condition. The HRV spectral power components were computed from the R-R interval sequences, and the RSA amplitude and phase were computed from the sinusoid fitting the instantaneous heart rate within each breath. Adding resistive loads resulted in 1) increasing respiratory period, 2) unchanging heart rate, and 3) increasing HRV and changing RSA characteristics. HRV and RSA characteristics are linearly correlated to the respiratory period. These modifications appear to be linked to load-induced changes in the respiratory period in each individual, because HRV and RSA characteristics are similar at a respiratory period obtained either by loading or by imposed frequency breathing. The present results are discussed with regard to the importance of the breathing cycle duration in these cardiorespiratory interactions, suggesting that these interactions may depend on the time necessary for activation and dissipation of neurotransmitters involved in RSA.

Thirty-six women (18 Caucasian and 18 Chinese) and 36 children (18 Caucasian and 18 Chinese) were evaluated during the administration of propofol/fentanyl anesthesia. Patients in each age group were randomized into three subgroups to receive single doses of 0.06, 0.12, or 0.18 mg/kg rocuronium (adults) or 0.12, 0.18, or 0.24 mg/kg rocuronium (children). Neuromuscular blockade was assessed by electromyography of the adductor pollicis after train-of-four (TOF) stimulation of the ulnar nerve. Dose response curves were constructed when maximum neuromuscular depression of the first twitch of the train (T-1) was obtained. A second bolus dose of rocuronium was then administered to a total dose of 0.6 mg/kg. The times of spontaneous recovery to T-1 10%, 25%, and 90% of control and to TOF 0.25, 0.50, and 0.70 were recorded. For both adults and children, recovery occurred later in Chinese than in Caucasian patients (P < 0.05 for T-1 of 10%, 25%. 75%, and 90% and TOF to 0.7). The 50% effective dose was smaller in Chinese adults (125 +/- 63 vs 159 +/- 66 <mu>g/kg) and Chinese children (171 +/- 43 vs 191 +/- 46 mug/kg) than in Caucasian adults and children, but the difference was not statistically significant. In adults, time to 25% T-1 recovery was 43 +/- 13 min in Chinese patients and 33 +/- 10 min in Caucasian patients (P < 0.05). The corresponding values were more rapid for children: 30 +/- 10 and 24 +/- 6 min (P < 0.05). We conclude that the recovery from rocuronium neuromuscular blockade was longer in Chinese compared with Caucasian patients and in adults compared with children.

The neuropsychological assessment includes the following tests: alertness, sustained attention, selective attention, working memory and long-term memory (explicit and implicit). The results suggest stability of attention and memory impairments, with significant improvement at attention sub-tests. No significant deterioration is observed. The results also suggest a correlation between the cognitive impairment and the intensity of negative symptoms as rated on the PANSS. As discussed in this article, these results are in accordance with recent reviews of the literature supporting the long term stability of cognitive impairment in schizophrenia.

Supportive findings from several additional studies are summarized with results from two new studies showing (I) NREM mentation is correlated with duration of prior REM sleep, and (2) REM sleep signs (eye movements, phasic EMG) occur frequently in NREM sleep. The covert REM sleep model represents one class of explanatory, models that combines the two assumptions of mind-body isomorphism and a 1-gen mentation generator; its future development will depend largely upon a more detailed understanding of sleep state interactions and their contribution to mind-body, isomorphisms.

Nine patients with unilateral frontal lesions, 9 patients with temporal lesions, and 9 controls performed a sequential key-press task involving 4 rapid choice responses to a 4-letter stimulus. Three conditions manipulated the number of responses that subjects knew in advance. The frontal group showed slow initiation times in all conditions. Knowing the first response produced an acceleration of initiation time in all 3 groups. However, knowing 3 responses in advance instead of 1 further accelerated initiation time in the control and temporal groups but not in the frontal group. These results indicate that frontal lesions impair the use of multiple representations during programming. This suggests that the attentional control of response selection is an important element of the response planning deficit.

J	Habib, M				Habib, M			The neurological basis of developmental dyslexia - An overview and working hypothesis	BRAIN			English	Review						dyslexia; brain imaging; phonology; temporal processing; reading	POSITRON EMISSION TOMOGRAPHY; PLANUM TEMPORALE ASYMMETRY; SPEECH-PERCEPTION DEFICITS; LEARNING-IMPAIRED CHILDREN; QUANTITATIVE-TRAIT LOCUS; ACOUSTICALLY MODIFIED SPEECH; CORPUS-CALLOSUM MORPHOLOGY; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; CEREBRAL BLOOD-FLOW; READING-DISABILITY	Five to ten per cent of school-age children fail to learn to read in spite of normal intelligence, adequate environment and educational opportunities. Thus defined, developmental dyslexia thereafter referred to as dyslexia) is usually considered of constitutional origin, but its actual mechanisms are still mysterious and currently remain the subject of intense research endeavour in various neuroscientific areas and along several theoretical frameworks. This article reviews evidence accumulated to date that favours a dysfunction of neural systems known to participate in the normal acquisition and achievement of reading and other related cognitive functions. Historically, the first arguments for a neurological basis of dyslexia came from neuropathological studies of brains from dyslexic individuals. These early studies, although open to criticism, for the first time drew attention towards a possible abnormality in specific stages of prenatal maturation of the cerebral cortex and suggested a role of atypical development of brain asymmetries. This has prompted a large amount of subsequent work using in vivo imaging methods in the same vein. These latter studies, however, have yielded less clear-cut results than expected, but have globally confirmed some subtle differences In brain anatomy whose exact significance is still under investigation. Neuropsychological studies have provided considerable evidence that the main mechanism leading to these children's learning difficulties is phonological in nature, namely a basic defect in segmentimg and manipulating the phoneme constituents of speech. A case has also been made for impairment in brain visual mechanisms of reading as a possible contributing factor. This approach has led to an important conceptual advance with the suggestion of a specific involvement of one subsystem of vision pathways (the so-called magnosystem hypothesis). Both phonological and visual hypotheses have received valuable contribution from modern functional imaging techniques. Results of recent PET and functional MRI studies are reported here in some detail. Finally, one attractive interpretation of available evidence points to dyslexia as a multi-system deficit possibly based on a fundamental incapacity of the brain in performing tasks requiring processing of brief stimuli in rapid temporal succession. It is proposed that this so-called 'temporal processing impairment' theory of dyslexia could also account for at least some of the perceptual, motor and cognitive symptoms very often associated with the learning disorder, a coincidence that has remained unexplained so far.

NFs have a well-established role as intrinsic determinants of axon caliber with all the functional implications, but the role of each individual NF subunit is much less clear. The aim of our study was to examine functional properties of large myelinated axons with altered morphology from mice bearing a targeted disruption of each NF genes (NF-L -/-, NF-M -/- and NF-H -/- mice). Membrane properties, action potentials and single axon refractory period were measured in isolated sciatic nerves in vitro, using intra-axonal microelectrode recording in conjunction with current-clamp technique. Some results were obtained from whole nerves by sucrose-gap recording. The NF-knockout mice showed several deficits in physiological properties of low-threshold fibers. In keeping with smaller axon diameter, the conduction velocity was significantly decreased in NF-L -/- and NF-M -/- transgenic animals (control, 39.9+/-1.8 m/s, NF-M -/-; 23.5+/-1.4 m/s, and NF-L-/-; 12.0+/-0.7 m/s, mean+/-S.E.M, intra-axonal recording; similar ratios obtained by sucrose-gap recording; 22-26 degreesC). However, in spite of their preserved caliber, large myelinated axons in NF-H -/- mice also showed a significant decrease in conduction velocity (22.8+/-1.0 m/s, mean+/-S.E.M.). Although action potential amplitudes, duration and shape did not differ between control axons and transgenic animals, the refractory period was prolonged in NF-H -/- and NF-M -/- animals. Intracellular injections of 200 ms depolarizing and hyperpolarizing currents revealed outward and inward rectification in all animal groups. In comparison to control animals, NF-H -/-mice expressed a significant decrease in outward rectification. Potassium channel blockers (4AP and TEA) and cesium ions were able to block outward and inward rectification in all myelinated axons in qualitatively the same manner. These results suggest that NF-H may have a specific role in modulating ion channel functions in large myelinated fibers. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science BN: All rights reserved.

Methods: We studied 12 patients undergoing surgery for congenital heart disease under narcotic-nitrous oxide anesthesia. Neuromuscular blockade was maintained constant (TI 4-10% by Datex electromyograph) by adjusting a vecuronium infusion. Plasma vecuronium concentrations (Cpss) were analysed by HPLC to describe a pseudosteady-state during each of the pre-CPB, CPB and post-CPB phases. Paired arterial blood samples were taken 20 min apart after at least 20 min of constant infusion. Results: Nine cases were analysed, mean age 20 mo, mean weight 9 kg, Three patients had deep and six moderate hypothermia. In the pre-CPB phase Cpss fell into two groups (mean +/- SD: 330 +/- 42 ng.ml(-1); 127 +/- 27 ng.ml(-1) P < 0.001); similarly the clearances showed a bimodal distribution (mean +/- SD: 5.08 +/- 0.94; 11.51 +/- 0.2 ml.min(-1).kg(-1) P < 0.001), although in different patients. During CPB this bimodal distribution disappeared. Vecuronium infusion rate (VIR) decreased by 84% and 92% from pre-CPB to CPB phase in deep and moderate hypothermia groups respectively (P < 0.05), paralleled by decreases in Cpss of 36% (P > 0.05) and 52% (P < 0.05). Conclusion: Changes in vecuronium requirements and plasma concentrations during CPB demonstrate vecuronium pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics are both affected by hypothermic CPB in infants. The finding of bimodal distributions for plasma vecuronium and vecuronium clearance highlights the need for individual monitoring of neuromuscular blockade in this age group.

Ten participants were presented auditory stimuli every 20 s while asleep. Trials were sorted according to the presence or absence of a K-Complex. A fast Fourier Transformation of the data was computed on EEC; segments prior to and following stimulus onset. The log power of activity in delta, theta, alpha, sigma, and beta bandwidths was computed. When a K-Complex was elicited, there were no differences in EEG activity prior to and following the stimulus. However, during slow wave sleep, when a K-Complex was not elicited, there was a significant overall increase in theta, alpha, sigma, and beta activity following stimulus. These results tend to support the notion that the K-Complex appears to prevent arousal.

RALDH1 mRNA transcripts are present in the stomach and small intestine, and their expression is regulated by vitamin A status. In situ hybridization demonstrated RALDH1 mRNA expression in epithelial cells of the stomach, small intestine, and large intestine. Strong hybridization was also seen in the lamina propria of small intestinal mucosa and the smooth muscle layer of the small and large intestines. Immunocytochemical localization revealed RALDH1 staining in parietal cells of the stomach and prismatic cells of the small and large intestines. The presence of RALDH1 protein was also detectable within supportive glial cells around neuronal fibers throughout the muscular layers of the stomach as well as the small and large intestines. These data suggest an important role for RALDH1 in generating RA needed for the differentiation of specific epithelial cells in the stomach and intestines.

Neurophysiological experiments, together with behavioral tests, are beginning to reveal the mechanisms underlying these signal-analysis tasks. Work summarized here focusses on two issues: first, how insects analyze the temporal structure of a single signal in the presence of other competing signals; and second, how the signal's location is represented by the binaural difference in neural activity.

This however has not been universally recognized. Clearly further investigation of this association is required. The purpose of this report is to examine the varied diagnostic criteria for common migraine utilized by epileptologists and other neurologists, to review clinical migraine epilepsy relationships, EEG abnormalities in migraine and epilepsy, and the association of seizures with vascular headache in patients with various forms of epilepsy. Hopefully, this will stimulate further research into this intriguing association of two conditions which though they have different pathophysiology frequently coexist.

Hemispherectomy eliminates all geniculocortical pathways and thus removes cortical factors involved in the survival of retinogeniculate projections. Complete removal of the left cerebral cortex was performed in two monkeys at 6 months and 8 months of age. After a postsurgical survival period of 50 months (SHG3) and 45 months (SHG4), both animals and a normal adult monkey received intraocular injections of [H-3]proline (5 mCi) in the left eye and WGA-HRP (100 mul, 5%) in the right eye. The dorsal lateral geniculate nucleuseuron (LGNd) ipsilateral to the hemispherectomy was on average 73% smaller than the contralateral LGNd. The magno- and parvocellular layers ipsilateral to the cortical ablation in both hemispherectomized subjects received a layered, eye-specific pattern of retinal input. This suggests that retinogeniculate projections could be sustained in the absence of geniculate relay cells.

A potential source of movement error and one that is readily controllable experimentally relates to limb dynamics and associated movement-dependent loads. In this paper, we have used a position control model to examine changes to control signals for arm movements in the context of movement-dependent loads. In the model, based on the equilibrium-point hypothesis, equilibrium shifts are adjusted directly in proportion to the positional error between desired and actual movements. The model is used to simulate multi-joint movements in the presence of both "internal" loads due to joint interaction torques, and externally applied loads resulting from velocity-dependent force fields. In both cases it is shown that the model can achieve close correspondence to empirical data using a simple linear adaptation procedure. An important feature of the model is that it achieves compensation for loads during movement without the need for either coordinate transformations between positional error and associated corrective forces, or inverse dynamics calculations.

This laboratory has also shown that NRGs stimulate the differentiation of neonatal rat OLGs and that these cells express the erbB receptors far NRGs (Raabe et al., 1997). In this study, we have characterized NRG expression in adult human OLG cultures isolated from the temporal lobe resection of intractable epilepsy patients. Using immunocytochemistry and Western blotting, we find that adult human OLGs contain both the alpha and beta isoforms of NRGs. In addition, Western blots show that the adult human OLGs secrete both isoforms as N-glycosylated molecules. These cells also express all four erbB receptor subtypes, and possibly an activated erbB receptor. The observation that these cells synthesize and secrete their own NRGs, and possibly express a tyrosine-phosphorylated erbB receptor, is consistent with autocrine and/or paracrine signaling. Amplification of this signaling may provide a useful mechanism to stimulate differentiation of adult human OLGs in demyelinating disease. (C) 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

The electrostimulation of sacral nerves provokes a simultaneous contraction of the detrusor muscle as well as the external urethral sphincter (EUS), A new simplified-architecture implantable stimulator with its wireless controller have been designed to investigate high-frequency inhibition stimulation strategies. This innovative technique based on high-frequency inhibition reduces sphincter activity during stimulation. Low-frequency current pulses also applied to the sacral roots induces contraction of the detrusor muscle resulting in low pressure voiding. Chronic experiments were carried out on ten male mongrel paraplegic dogs, One cuff electrode was implanted along with each stimulator for eight months. The animals were stimulated twice a day using the prototypes of our implantable selective stimulator while voided and residual urine volume were measured during the procedure, These experiments revealed that the proposed stimulation strategy enhances bladder voiding by more than 50% in comparison with low-frequency only stimulation. The residual urine volume was reduced to an average of 9% and low pressure micturition was achieved as shown by weekly cystourethrogram.

NEP substrates such as bombesin and endothelin-1 induce cell migration. We investigated the mechanisms of NEP regulation of cell migration in PC cells, including regulation of phosphorylation on tyrosine of focal adhesion kinase (FAK). Western analyses and cell migration assays revealed an inverse correlation between NEP expression and the levels of FAK phosphorylation and cell migration in PC cell lines. Constitutively expressed NEP, recombinant NEP, and induced NEP expression using a tetracycline-repressive expression system inhibited bombesin- and endothelin-1-stimulated FAK phosphorylation and cell migration. This results from NEP-induced inhibition of neuropeptide-stimulated association of FAK with cSrc protein. Expression of a mutated catalytically inactive NEP protein also resulted in partial inhibition of FAK phosphorylation and cell migration. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments show that NEP associates with tyrosine-phosphorylated Lyn kinase, which then binds the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K) resulting in an NEP-Lyn-PI3-K protein complex. This complex competitively blocks FAK-PI3-K interaction, suggesting that NEP protein inhibits cell migration via a protein-protein interaction independent of its catalytic function. These experiments demonstrate that NEP can inhibit FAK phosphorylation on tyrosine and PC cell migration through multiple pathways and suggest that cell migration which contributes to invasion and metastases in PC cells can be regulated by NEP.

We now present direct evidence for this involvement using CEP-1347, a specific inhibitor of SAPK activation. Inhibition by this drug of stress-induced phosphorylation of NFH and the middle-molecular-mass neurofilament subunit in the perikaryon of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons paralleled the decrease in levels of activated SAPKs and was essentially complete at 1 muM CEP-1347. In addition, a role for SAPKs in the constitutive phosphorylation of NFH was demonstrated. Longterm treatment of unstressed DRG neurons with CE-1347 lowered the steady-state phosphorylation level of NFH in neurites, No such effect was seen in neurons treated with PD 098059, which blocks activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2. DRG neurites were shown to contain high basal levels of activated SAPKs. These included a 55-kDa SAPK whose activation was completely abolished at 0.05 muM CEP-1347 and a 45-kDa SAPK that was not affected by the drug. These results indicate that SAPKs are involved in both stress-induced and constitutive phosphorylation of NFH, The differing responses of SAPKs in neurites and cell bodies to CEP-1347 inhibition further suggest the presence of different signaling pathways in the two neuronal compartments.

In 5-HT1A knockouts, 5-HT concentrations were unchanged throughout, but levels of 5-HT metabolites were higher than those of the wild type in dorsal/medial raphe nuclei, olfactory bulb, substantia nigra, and locus coeruleus. This was taken as an indication of increased 5-HT turnover, reflecting an augmented basal activity of midbrain raphe neurons and consequent increase in their somatodendritic and axon terminal release of 5-HT. It provided a likely explanation for the increased anxious-like behavior observed in 5-HT1A knockout mice. Concomitant increases in DA content and/or DA turnover were interpreted as the result of a disinhibition of DA, whereas increases in noradrenaline concentration in some territories of projection of the locus coeruleus could reflect a diminished activity of its neurons. In 5-HT1B. knockouts, 5-HT concentrations were lower than those of the wild type in nucleus accumbens, locus coeruleus, spinal cord, and probably also several other territories of 5-HT innervation. A decrease in DA, associated with increased DA turnover, was measured in nucleus accumbens. These changes in 5-HT and DA metabolism were consistent with the increased aggressiveness and the supersensitivity to cocaine reported in 5-HT1B knockout mice. Thus, markedly different alterations in CNS monoamine metabolism may contribute to the opposite behavioral phenotypes of these two knockouts.

Immunocytochemical studies reveal a somatodendritic Kv4.2 expression pattern, with the channels concentrated mainly at dendritic spines. The molecular mechanism that underlies the localization of Kv4.2 to this subcellular region is unknown. We used the yeast two-hybrid system to identify the Kv4.2-associated proteins that are involved in channel localization. Here we demonstrate a direct interaction between Kv4.2 and the actin-binding protein, filamin. We show that Kv4.2 and filamin can be coimmunoprecipitated both in vitro and in brain and that Kv4.2 and filamin share an overlapping expression pattern in the cerebellum and cultured hippocampal neurons. To examine the functional consequences of this interaction, we expressed Kv4.2 in filamin(+) and filamin(-) cells and performed immunocytochemical and electrophysiological analyses. Our results indicate that Kv4.2 colocalizes with filamin at filopodial roots in filamin(+) cells but shows a nonspecific expression pattern in filamin(-) cells, with no localization to filopodial roots. Furthermore, the magnitude of whole-cell Kv4.2 current density is similar to2.7-fold larger in filamin(+) cells as compared with these currents in filamin(-) cells. We propose that filamin may function as a scaffold protein in the postsynaptic density, mediating a direct link between Kv4.2 and the actin cytoskeleton, and that this interaction is essential for the generation of appropriate Kv4.2 current densities.

The current study used antisense techniques to evaluate the role of DOR in mediating supraspinal antinociception in rats. All of the opioid agonists tested (delta -selective: deltorphin II, DPDPE, pCI-DPDPE, SNC80; mu -selective: DAMGO; i.c.v.) provided significant, dose-dependent antinociception in the paw pressure assay. Administration of a phosphodiester antisense oligonucleotide (i.c.v.) targeted against DOR inhibited antinociception in response to SNC80, deltorphin II, and pCl-DPDPE compared with mismatch and saline-treated controls. However, antisense treatment did not inhibit the response to DPDPE or DAMGO. In contrast, the highly selective mu -antagonist CTOP blocked antinociception in response to ED80 concentrations of DAMGO and DPDPE, reduced the response to pCl-DPDPE, and did not alter the response to deltorphin II or SNC80. In total, these data suggest that DOR mediates the antinociceptive response to deltorphin II, SNC80, and pCl-DPDPE at supraspinal sites and further demonstrates that the DOR-mediated response to deltorphin II and SNC80 is independent of mu -receptor activation. Conversely, supraspinal antinociception in response to DPDPE is mediated by a receptor distinct from DOR; this response is directly or indirectly sensitive to mu -receptor blockade. The distinct pharmacological profile of DPDPE suggests that either this prototypical delta -agonist mediates antinociception by a direct, nonselective interaction at mu -receptors or DPDPE interacts with a novel delta -subtype that, in turn, indirectly activates mu -receptors in the brain.

We have generated replication-defective adenoviruses containing epitope-tagged, wild-type-, Tr-, or Tr-J-PMP22 bicistronic with the Lac-Z reporter gene. These viruses were microinjected into the sciatic nerves of 10-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats and, later, analyzed by immunohistochemistry to determine the distribution of mutant protein in infected myelinating Schwann cells. We found that epitope-tagged, wild-type PMP22 is successfully transported to compact myelin, whereas the Tr and the Tr-J mutant proteins are retained in cytoplasmic compartment, colocalizing with the endoplasmic reticulum. These results provide in vivo evidence that the pathogenesis of the Tr and Tr-J mutations are most likely a function of abnormal retention within the endoplasmic reticulum of myelinating Schwann cells, (C) 2000 Academic Press.

In addition, the blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability surface area products for Trp (PST) and alpha -MTrp (PSalpha) were measured in normal rats. The results suggest that, in both groups of rats, there is a highly significant correlation (p < 0.05; Pearson Product Moment Correlation (PPMC) between the brain uptake and trapping constants for alpha -MTrp and those of Trp via the 5-HT metabolic pathway, but there is no significant correlation (p > 0.05; PPMC) between either of these constants and the PS products of either compound. There is also no significant correlation (p > 0.05; PPMC) between the constant for the Trp incorporation into proteins with any of the other parameters. For all parameters, except Trp incorporation into proteins (alpha -MTrp is not incorporated into proteins), there was a highly significant correlation (p < 0.001) between the quantities measured for Trp and alpha -MTrp. The data presented here strongly suggests that the brain uptake and trapping of alpha -MTrp relates to brain 5-HT synthesis, and does not relate to the BBB transport or protein incorporation of Trp. On the basis of these results, as well as those previously reported, we concluded that trapping (unidirectional uptake) of alpha -MTrp can be converted to the 5-HT synthesis rates in the brain. From this also follows that labeled alpha -MTrp is a good tracer for in vivo evaluation of the brain 5-HT synthesis.

Sulcal information was transferred to a surgical microscope with enhanced reality features. This assistance was used for the resection of supratentorial cavernomas (7 parients). Sulci were semi-automatically segmented from 30 MRI data sets. Sulci close to the cavernoma were selected and transfer red to the neuronavigation system which allows the superimposition of graphics into the right ocular of the microscope. Selected sulci were displayed on the workstation and superimposed into the ocular of the microscope. Cortical sulci proved to be useful for the recognition of the anatomical environment. The superimposed sulci helped to optimize location and size of the skin incision as well as to guide the access to the cavernoma by using the course of a sulcus as indirect trajectory.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether T2 relaxometry can identify hippocampal pathology and lateralize the epileptic focus in patients with intractable TLE, who do not demonstrate hippocampal atrophy on volumetric MRI (MRIV). We selected 14 patients with unilateral TLE who had unilateral atrophy and 11 patients with unilateral TLE who had no evidence of atrophy on MRIV. Images were acquired on a 1.5 T MR scan using a dual echo sequence with 23 contiguous oblique coronal slices in all patients and in 14 healthy subjects. Fitting a single exponential decay equation to the imaging data generated T2 maps. Averages of six slices containing the head, body, and tail of the hippocampus were used to calculate hippocampal T2 relaxation times (HT2). The epileptic focus was defined by history, video-EEG, and surgical response. All TLE patients with hippocampal atrophy and 9/11 (82%) patients with normal MRI had abnormally high HT2 ipsilateral to the epileptic focus. Bilateral abnormal HT2 were found in 6/14 (43%) of patients with unilateral hippocampal atrophy and 2/11 (18%) of patients with normal MRI, However, this increase was always greater ipsilateral to the epileptic focus. Qualitative hippocampal pathology showed gliosis and neuronal loss in 10/14 operated patients with hippocampal atrophy on MRIV and in 5/7 operated patients with normal MRI. In conclusion, hippocampal T2 mapping provides evidence of hippocampal damage in the majority of patients with intractable TLE who have no evidence of atrophy on MRI and can correctly lateralize the epileptic focus in most patients.

Studies of life-span changes in nociception and pain behaviours in the rat are equivocal making it difficult to draw firm conclusions. This paper reviews the available data and finds that age differences in nociception may be dependent on the pain test employed. Specifically, reflexive responses to nociceptive stimuli do not change with age while there may be no change or a linear decrease with age on more highly organized tests of nociception. Interestingly, age differences in pain behaviours on models of tissue injury and inflammation may not be linear. It is shown that important changes that begin at midlife in neuroanatomy, neurochemistry and endogenous pain inhibition may be associated with alterations in pain sensitivity. Several testable hypotheses which might encourage future research in this domain are developed throughout this paper. (C) 2000 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

Intravenous injection of 10 mg of the hormone dissolved in Nutralipid produced a significant increase of the population spike (PS), but not of the excitatory post-synaptic potentials (EPSP). The results are discussed in terms of the potential enhancement that androsterone sulfate may have on memory as was described for one of its parent compounds, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and its potential use as an antidepressant.

Here we want to show that this problem of measurement noise can be circumscribed, and that fMRI allows to obtain robust functional maps of auditory activity, minimally contaminated by the noise artifact, for an auditory stimulation presented against a silent background. We then describe different fMRI experimental paradigms that can be adapted to the scientific question of interest, illustrated with data from our own work: the block design, the event-related design, and measures of neuronal adaptation.

This multicenter, prospective study evaluated the long-term effectiveness of sacral nerve stimulation using the implantable Medtronic interStim therapy for urinary control in patients with otherwise intractable complaints of urinary urge incontinence, urgency-frequency, or retention. Each patient first underwent temporary, percutaneous sacral nerve test stimulation. If at least a 50% reduction in target symptoms was documented for at least 3 days, patients received a permanent Medtronic InterStim sacral nerve stimulation system that includes a surgically implanted lead and neurostimulator. Regular follow-up was conducted with outcome data. We report here on patients who have been observed from 1.5 to 3 years postimplantation. The results demonstrate that after 3 years, 59% of 41 urinary urge incontinent patients showed greater than 50% reduction in leaking episodes per day with 46% of patients being completely dry. After 2 years, 56% of the urgency-frequency patients showed greater than 50% reduction in voids per day. After 1.5 years, 70% of 42 retention patients showed greater than 50% reduction in catheter volume per catheterization. We conclude that the Medtronic InterStim therapy for urinary control system is an effective therapy with sustained clinical benefit for patients with intractable symptoms of urinary urge incontinence, urgency-frequency, or retention.

SR142801 and its (R)-enantiomer SR142806 (1.3, 6.5 and 65 nmol) were found as potent as senktide and [MePhe(7)]NKB (NK-3 selective agonists) to induce transient antinociceptive effects. Naloxone(10 Gig) and R820 (6.5 nmol) blocked reversibly the responses to 6.5 nmol senktide, [MePhe(7)]NKB, SR142801 and SR142806 when administered i.t. 15 min earlier. However, the antinociceptive responses induced by SR142801 and SR142806 were not affected by i.t. pretreatments with NK-1 (6.5 nmol SR140333) and NK-2 (6.5 nmol SR48968) receptor antagonists. In control experiments, the NK-1 and NK-2 antagonists prevented the hyperalgesic effects to NK-I ([Sar(9),Met(O-2)(11)]SP) and NK-2 ([beta-Ala(8)] NKA(4-10)) receptor agonists (6.5 nmol i.t.), respectively. R820 had no direct effect on nociceptive threshold and failed to alter angiotensin II-induced antinociception The data suggest that the antinociceptive effect of SR142801 is due to an agonist effect at NK-3 receptor in the rat spinal cord that involves a local opioid mechanism. These results can be best explained by the existence of inter-species NK-3 receptor subtypes.

To extend on these results, we performed a psychoneuroendocrine study of 217 children and 139 mothers. Methods: Salivary cortisol levels and cognitive function were assessed in children, and a semistructured phone interview measuring symptoms of stress and depression was conducted with their mothers. Results: Children with low socioeconomic status present significantly,higher salivary cortisol levels than children with high socioeconomic status, and this socioeconomic status effect emerges as early as age 6, We also report that a child's cortisol level is significantly correlated with his or her mother's extent of depressive symptomatology. Conclusions: These results offer a neurobiological determinant to the well-known association between socioeconomic status and health that begins early in life.

It is possible to study postnatally, in this species, almost the entire development of its motor behaviors as well as of the nerve centers involved in their control. The lumbosacral spinal cord of the newborn comprises a thick ventricular zone containing mitotic figures, an intermediate zone of small and undifferentiated cells, and a thin marginal zone. The hindlimbs are little more than embryonic buds. The presumptive bones consist of cartilageneous or mesenchymal condensations and the presumptive muscles of immature myofibers mixed and surrounded with mesenchyme. Cholinergic fibers from lumbosacral motoneurons are already seen among the myofibers, but most of hindlimb motor innervation develops postnatally, The long descending and ascending projection systems connecting the lumbosacral enlargement to the cervical cord and the encephalon also form largely postnatally, but lateral vestibular and medullary reticular axons are present in the lumbosacral cord at birth. Synaptogenesis in the lumbosacral enlargement occurs largely postnatally, according to a general outside-in gradient, and the earliest evidence for it is on lateral motoneurons, Myelinogenesis therein is even later. These observations on neural development are correlated with observations on the development of simple reflex behaviors and locomotion, (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.

Glioblastoma multiforme in childhood is rare, and the prognosis for patients with the disease is poor. The Pediatric Oncology Society of the Germanic language group (GPOH) enrolls patients in a series of pilot trials, the first of which is reported here (HIT-GBM-A). METHODS. Twenty-two patients with glioblastoma multiforme, World Health Organization Grade 4, between the ages of 3-15 years (45% male) were enrolled during the period 1995-1997. There were 13 supratentorial tumors, 8 brainstem tumors, and 1 cerebellar tumor. The patients underwent the following procedures: stereotactic biopsy (n = 3 patients), open biopsy (n = 1 patient), partial resection (n = 6 patients), subtotal resection (n = 4 patients), and macroscopic total resection (n = 8 patients). Adjuvant treatment consisted of oral chemotherapy with trofosfamide, 100 mg/m(2), and etoposide, 25 mg/m(2), daily or for 21-day cycles interrupted by 1-week rests. Standard fractionated radiation (54 grays) was started concurrently with the first cycle. RESULTS. The chemotherapy was well tolerated, with no treatment-related deaths and only minor side effects. The responses in 12 evaluable patients after two cycles were as follows: 1 complete response, 1 partial response, 3 patients with stable disease, and 7 patients with progressive disease. The median overall survival was 12 months. The 1-year, 2-year, and 4-year overall survival rates were 52%, 26%, and 22%, respectively, and the event free survival rates were 26%, 22%, and 4%, respectively. None of the four surviving patients (3.2 years, 3.4 years, 3.0 years, and 4.2 years after diagnosis) is event free. Two patients are alive after tumor progression: One patient was diagnosed with a medulloblastoma, and one patient was diagnosed with an osteosarcoma as second malignancies. A control group extracted from the Surveillance, Epidemiology: and End Results data had lower survival rates: the difference between the groups was not statistically significant (P = 0.26). CONCLUSIONS. This chemotherapy will not be used in a randomized trial of patients with glioblastoma; however, it may be evaluated for patients with tumors that have more chemoresponsive histologies.

Here, we show by direct microinjection of recombinant active enzymes that caspase-6 (>0.5 pg/cell) induces a protracted course of apoptosis in neurons in a caspase-specific, dose- and time-dependent manner in the presence of serum. Only transient activation of caspase-6 is required to initiate apoptosis. Caspase-6 induces apoptosis directly without the activation of other caspase effectors. Doses of caspase-6 of <0.25 pg/cell induce only 20% cell death within 16 d but render neurons vulnerable to oxidative stress, indicating that caspase activation affects neurons despite the absence of cell death. Caspase-3 induces neuronal apoptosis in 20% of the cells, whereas caspase-7 or -8 do not induce apoptosis. In contrast, astrocytes undergo apoptosis within 24 hr when microinjected with caspase-3 but not caspase-6, -7, or -8. These results show cell type-specific vulnerability to caspases in the CNS. The results suggest that activation of caspases in human neurons does not lead to an immediate and rapid process of cell death but provokes a protracted form of apoptosis. Activation of caspases in human neurons may participate in the long-term overproduction of A<beta> and other potential toxic fragments resulting from caspase-mediated proteolysis. These results are consistent with the protracted and age-dependent nature of AD.

Here, we have examined the effects on the electroencephalogram (EEG) and sleep-wake state of basal forebrain administration of neurotensin (NT), a neuropeptide that has been shown in vitro to potently and selectively modulate the cholinergic cells. Microinjection of (0.1-3.0 mM) NT into the basal forebrain of freely moving, naturally waking-sleeping rats produced ka dose-dependent decrease in delta (similar to1-4 Hz) and increase in both theta (similar to4-9 Hz) and high-frequency gamma activity (30-60 Hz) across cortical, areas with no increase in the electromyogram. These EEG changes were accompanied by concomitant decreases in slow wave sleep (SWS) and transitional SWS (tSWS), increases in wake, and most remarkably, increases in paradoxical sleep (PS) and transitional PS (tPS), despite the virtual absence of SWS. The effects were attributed to direct action on cholinergic neurons as evidenced by selective internalization of a fluorescent ligand, Fluo-NT, in choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) immunoreactive cells and stimulation by NT of bursting discharge in juxtacellularly recorded, Neurobiotin-labeled, ChAT-immunoreactive neurons. We conclude that NT-induced rhythmic bursting of cholinergic basal forebrain neurons stimulates rhythmic theta oscillations and gamma across the cerebral cortex. With the selective action of NT on the cholinergic cells, their bursting discharge promotes theta and gamma independent of motor activity and thereby also stimulates and enhances PS.

Because previous studies of neonatal rat spinal cord in vitro suggest that the most important lumbar segments for rhythmogenesis are L1-L2, we investigated the role of various lumbar segments in the initiation of walking movements on a treadmill of adult cats spinalized (T13), 5-6 d earlier. The locomotor activities were evaluated from electromyographic and video recordings. The results show that: (1) localized topical application of clonidine in restricted baths over either the L3-L4 or the L5-L7 segments was sufficient to induce walking movements. Yohimbine, an alpha2-noradrenergic antagonist, could block this locomotion when applied over L3-L4 or L5-L7; (2) microinjections of clonidine in one or two lumbar segments from L3 to L5 could also induce locomotion; (3) after an intravenous injection of clonidine, locomotion was blocked by microinjections of yohimbine in segments L3, L4, or L5 but not if the injection was in L6; (4) locomotion was also blocked in all cases by additional spinal transections at L3 or L4. These results show that it is possible to initiate walking in the adult spinal cat with a pharmacological stimulation of a restricted number of lumbar segments and also that the integrity of the L3-L4 segments is necessary to sustain the locomotor activity.

To directly address this issue, we combined whole-cell patch-clamp recording of spontaneously occurring postsynaptic currents (PSCs) with morphological analysis of layer V pyramidal neurons in the parietal cortex of young adult (1- to 2-month-old) and aged (28- to 37-month-old) BNxF344 F-1 hybrid rats. Analysis of spontaneous PSCs was used to contrast functional properties of basal synaptic input with structural alterations in the dendritic tree of pyramidal neurons and density of terminals in contact with these cells. We observed significant changes in a number of morphological parameters of pyramidal neurons in aged rats. These include smaller cell body size and fewer basal dendritic branches (but not of oblique dendrites and dendritic tufts) and spines. Ultrastructural analysis also revealed a lower density of presynaptic terminals per unit length of postsynaptic membrane of labeled pyramidal neurons in the aged brain. This reduction in both presynaptic and postsynaptic elements was paralleled by a significant decrease in frequency of tetrodotoxin-insensitive miniature (action potential-independent) PSCs (mPSCs). The frequency of excitatory and inhibitory mPSCs was reduced to the same extent. In contrast, no significant change was observed in the frequency of spontaneous PSCs recorded in absence of tetrodotoxin (sPSCs), indicating an increase in action potential-dependent (frequency(sPSCs) - frequency(mPSCs)) input to pyramidal neurons in the aged group. This functional compensation may explain the lack of drastic loss of spontaneous neuronal activity in normal aging.

J	Pflieger, JF; Dubuc, R				Pflieger, JF; Dubuc, R			Relationship between vestibular primary afferents and vestibulospinal neurons in lampreys	JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE NEUROLOGY			English	Article						brainstem; vestibular system; labyrinth; octavolateral area; Mauthner cell; motor behavior	LARVAL SEA LAMPREY; FICTIVE LOCOMOTION; RETICULOSPINAL NEURONS; MAUTHNER CELL; SPINAL-CORD; BRAIN-STEM; HORSERADISH-PEROXIDASE; ANTIDROMIC DISCHARGES; SYNAPTIC-INTERACTIONS; CENTRAL PROJECTIONS	The distribution of vestibular primary afferents as well as their relationship with vestibulospinal and other brainstem neurons were studied in lampreys using anatomical tracers. Afferents from the anterior (aVIIIn) and the posterior (pVIIIn) branches of the vestibular nerve were located mainly in the ventral nucleus of the octavolateral area. The relationship between afferents and vestibulospinal neurons was studied by applying one fluorescent tracer to the whole vestibular nerve or one of its branches and applying another tracer to the spinal cord. Some afferents showed large, bulb-like enlargements (bulbs) and about 20 of these were found in the anterior and the intermediate octavomotor nucleus, whereas about 40 were found in the posterior octavomotor nucleus. Some of the bulbs made apparent contact with vestibulospinal neurons in the intermediate octavomotor nucleus and originated mostly from the aVIIIn, whereas bulbs in the posterior octavomotor nucleus originated from the pVIIIn. Applications of biocytin to hemi-segments of rostral spinal cord labeled vestibulospinal neurons located in the ipsilateral intermediate octavomotor nucleus and the contralateral posterior octavomotor nucleus. In addition, vestibular primary afferents with bulbs in apparent contact with vestibulospinal neurons were transneuronally labeled by biocytin. They were observed in the ipsilateral aVIIIn and the contralateral pVIIIn and could be followed in the labyrinths, where they innervated the vertical and horizontal arms of the semicircular canal crests. Taken together, these results indicate that vestibular primary afferents from the aVIIIn innervate predominantly vestibulospinal neurons of the intermediate octavomotor nucleus, whereas afferents from the pVIIIn innervate vestibulospinal neurons in the posterior octavomotor nucleus. This anatomical organization suggests that afferents carrying bulbs convey dynamic information to vestibulospinal neurons, which, in turn, project to the spinal cord networks.

A previous study from our laboratory has demonstrated that in rat brain, both PC2 and PC5A may be co-expressed with NT, lending support to a physiological implication of these Mo enzymes in the endoproteolytic maturation of pro-NT/NN. In the present study, we sought to determine whether PC1 might also be involved in this process by comparing the immunohistochemical distribution of the enzyme with that of NT in both singly labeled and dually labeled serial brain sections. PC1 was found to co-localize extensively with NT throughout the rat neuraxis. However, there were important regional variations in the proportion of NT neurons co-expressing PC1. Furthermore, this proportion was negatively correlated with that of NT neurons expressing PC5, suggesting that PC1 may serve as an alternative to PC5A for processing pro-NT/NN in mammalian brain.

J	Li, H; Henry, JL				Li, H; Henry, JL			Adenosine action on interneurons and synaptic transmission onto interneurons in rat hippocampus in vitro	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						adenosine; chloroadenosine; interneuron; hippocampus; afterhyperpolarization	LACUNOSUM-MOLECULARE INTERNEURONS; NON-PYRAMIDAL CELLS; POSTSYNAPTIC POTENTIALS; CA1; RECEPTORS; INVITRO; SLICES; RELEASE; HYPERPOLARIZATION; CA1-REGION	To investigate the action of adenosine on interneurons as well as on excitatory synaptic transmission onto interneurons in the hippocampus, intracellular recordings were made from electrophysiologically identified interneurons in the CA1 region of the hippocampal slice in vitro. The effects of adenosine and the preferential adenosine A(1) receptor agonist, chloroadenosine, were examined. Application of 50 muM adenosine and 20 muM chloroadenosine to the bath produced a hyperpolarization of 5.6 +/- 1.6 (n = 5) and 6.1 +/- 1.4 mV (n = 6), respectively, as well as a decrease in membrane input resistance of 18.1 +/- 3.5% (n = 5) and 18.5 +/- 1.4% (n = 6), respectively. Adenosine depressed the postsynaptic potentials (PSPs) elicited in the interneurons by stimulation of Schaffer collateral fibers by 73 +/- 6.8% (n = 5). The amplitude and the duration of the afterhyperpolarization which followed the spike of the action potential were attenuated by 48 +/- 6.9% and 31 +/- 8.6%, respectively (n = 5). Chloroadenosine depressed the evoked PSPs in these interneurons by 61.2 +/- 2.7% (n = 6) and depressed the duration and the amplitude of the afterhyperpolarization by 85.2 +/- 4.5% and by 72.6 +/- 4.8%, respectively (n = 6). The data show that adenosine and chloroadenosine directly inhibit hippocampal CA1 interneurons by blocking the synaptic input, by hyperpolarizing the membrane potential and by depressing the afterhyperpolarization following individual action potential spikes. It is proposed that adenosine A(1) receptors are present at pre- and/or postsynaptic sites of interneuron synapses in the hippocampal CA1 region. The present findings demonstrate that adenosine A(1) receptor activation in CA1 interneurons is able to modulate the excitatory synaptic input to, and excitability of, these neurons. Thus, as adenosine is released during ischemia and epilepsy, adenosine may protect both interneurons and pyramidal cells from glutamate excitotoxicity through activation of adenosine A(1) receptors on these neurons in the hippocampus.

Neuropeptide FF was administered intrathecally (i.t.; 10.0, 25.0 and 50.0 nmol) or intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.; 10.0, 12.5 and 15.0 nmol) either 24 h after inflammation-inducing injections of Freund's Complete Adjuvant in one hind paw or 7 days after unilateral sciatic nerve constriction. Evoked pain was assessed by measuring the withdrawal response threshold (in grams of pressure) to a mechanical stimulus applied to the plantar surface of the injured paw. Neuropeptide FF dose-dependently attenuated the allodynic response (i.e., withdrawal from a normally innocuous stimulus) to mechanical stimulation in the inflammatory and neuropathic model following i.t. (ED50 = 20.86 nmol and ED50 = 18.91 nmol, respectively) and i.c.v. (ED50 = 12.31 nmol and ED50 = 11.68 nmol, respectively) administration. Pretreatment with naloxone (2.0 mg/kg; s.c.) attenuated the anti-allodynic effect of i.t. or i.c.v. Neuropeptide FF in rats experiencing inflammatory, but not neuropathic pain. In contrast, Neuropeptide FF administered i.t. (10.0, 25.0 and 50.0 nmol) or i.c.v. (10.0, 12.5 and 15.0 nmol) had no effect on the response to acute thermal or mechanical stimulation. Neuropeptide FF injected i.t. or i.c.v, in inflamed or neuropathic rats did not produce any sign of motor dysfunction. These results suggest that Neuropeptide FF acting at spinal and supraspinal sites plays a role in modulating chronic, but not acute pain. Furthermore, the results suggest that the anti-allodynic effect of Neuropeptide FF is mediated indirectly by naloxone-sensitive opioid mechanisms in rats subjected to inflammatory, but not neuropathic pain.

A vesicular stomatitis virus G protein (VSVG)-pseudotyped retrovector was engineered to co-express the green fluorescent protein (GFP) and Cx43 in the communication-deficient neuro-2a (N2a) cell line. The 293 GPG packaging cell line was used to produce VSVG-pseudotyped retrovectors coding for GFP, Cx43, or chimeric Cx43 GFP fusion protein. The titer of viral supernatant, as measured by flow cytometry for GFP fluorescence, was approximately 2.0 x 10(7) colony form units (CFU)/ml and was free of replication-competent retroviruses. After a 7-day treatment with retinoic acid (20 muM), N2a transformants (N2a-Cx43 and N2a-Cx43 GFP) maintained the expression of Cx43 and Cx43 GFP. Expression of both constructs resulted in functional coupling, as evidenced by electrophysiological and dye-injection analysis. Suppression of cell growth correlated with expression of both Cx43 or Cx43 GFP and retinoic acid treatment. Based on morphology and immunocytochemistry for neurofilament, no difference was observed in the differentiation of N2a cells compared with cells expressing Cx43 constructs. In conclusion, constitutive expression of Cx43 in N2a cells does not alter retinoic acid-induced neuronal differentiation but does enhance growth inhibition.

The oncogenic potential of HTLV-1 resides in the 353-aa, 40-kDa viral Tax: oncoprotein, a positive regulator of viral gene transcription. A novel member of the interferon regulatory factor (IRF) family of transcription factors, IRF-4, was shown to be constitutively produced in HTLV-infected cells. IRF-4 is transiently expressed in anti-CD3 and PMA/ionomycin-stimulated T lymphocytes but not in continuous non-Tax-expressing T cell lines. In transient coexpression assays, HTLV-1 Tax protein induced the 1.2-kb IRF-4 promoter, indicating that Tax functions as an indirect trans-activator of the IRF-4 gene. Furthermore, IRF-4 levels in HTLV-1-infected cells appear to be proportional to the level of Tax expression, suggesting a role for IRF-4 in T cell transformation. In an effort to further characterize IRF-4 function, we identified a novel interaction between IRF-4 and FKBP52, a 59-kDa member of the immunophilin family with peptidyl-prolyl isomerase activity (PPIase), IRF-4-FKBP52 association inhibited the interaction between IRF-4 and its DNA-binding partner IPU.1, as well as the trans-activation function of IRE-4/PU.1. FKBP52 association resulted in a structural modification of IRF-4, detectable by immunoblot analysis and by IRF-4 partial proteolysis. These results demonstrate a novel posttranslational mechanism of transcriptional control, mediated through the interaction of an immunophilin with a transcriptional regulator.

HTLV-1 infection and enhanced expression of TNF-alpha by microglial cells, astrocytes, and macrophages has been hypothesized to lead to the destruction of myelin and oligodendrocytes in the CNS, Although the association of HTLV-2 infection and development of neurological disease is more tenuous, HTLV-2 has also been found to be associated with peripheral neuropathies, To investigate the roles of HTLV Taxi and Tart in the induction of cytokine disregulation in these cell types, we are currently developing gene delivery vectors based on human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) capable of stably coexpressing the HTLV-1 or -2 tax and eGFP reporter genes in primary human cells. Transduction frequencies of up to 50%, as assessed by eGFP expression, can be achieved in human monocyte-derived macrophages and in explanted cultures of human microglia, Preliminary data suggest that Taxi expression is sufficient to up-regulate the proinflammatory cytokine profile in explanted human microglial cells. Future experiments will compare and evaluate the effect of tax(1) and tax(2) gene expression on the cellular proinflammatory cytokine expression profile, as well as demonstrate the effects of transducing human fetal astrocytes and PBMC-derived macrophages.

The mean frequency of NBI-5788-responsive T cells (stimulation index > 3) in MS patients treated with the APL was 35.8 +/- 12.8% (n = 7) compared with a mean frequency of 6.2 +/- 1.3% (n = 7) for the untreated patients. The mean frequency of whole MBP-responsive T cells in MS patients treated with the APL was not significantly different from that of untreated patients (16.4 +/- 5.7% vs 18.0 +/- 6.3%, respectively). NBI-5788-reactive T-cell lines generated from NBI-5788-treated patients exhibited an increased frequency of cross-reactivity with MBP peptide 83-99 compared with NBI-5788-reactive lines from control MS patients. Cytokine secretion by APL-reactive T-cell lines from NBI-5788-treated MS patients was more frequently T-helper 2-like compared with T-cell lines from untreated MS patients. These results demonstrate that subcutaneous administration of a soluble APL based on the MBP peptide 83-99 in MS patients can induce an APL-reactive immune response in which T lymphocytes cross-reactive with the immunodominant neuroantigen MBP secrete anti-inflammatory cytokines. The significant heterogeneity in immune response between individuals indicates the need for clinical laboratory correlation during the course of therapeutic trials.

We have developed a new surgical technique to eliminate CA during the Norwood operation. A modified Blalock-Taussig shunt (BTS) was fully constructed before cannulation for cardiopulmonary bypass. The aortic cannula was inserted in the patent ductus arteriosus to allow systemic cold perfusion. When deep hypothermia was reached, the aortic cannula was redirected into the pulmonary artery (PA) confluence. Both cerebral and systemic perfusion were maintained through the right PA and BTS into the innominate artery. (Ann Thorac Surg 2000;70:1730-3) (C) 2000 by The Society of Thoracic Surgeons.

The authors have suggested that an alternative interpretation based on contextual elements could underlie this difficulty. The purpose of this study was to verify whether subjects who suffer a right hemisphere lesion have as much difficulty interpreting context and speech acts in a natural communicative situation as in a non-natural or pseudo-natural situation. A group of 28 subjects (14 RHD subjects and 14 normal controls) were given three tasks, which represented three different communicative situations: natural, non-natural, and pseudo-natural. The results show that RHD subjects process speech acts as efficiently as controls when they occur in a natural or pseudo-natural situation. However, they process direct and indirect speech acts significantly worse than controls in a non-natural communicative context. These results suggest that the natural character of the situation is crucial to this type of study. The ecological validity of previous studies is questioned, and it is suggested that the types of tasks formerly used do not measure the processing of speech acts per se, but rather the ability to judge the plausibility of a statement expressing an indirect speech act based on the naturalness of the contextual elements.

J	Nicolakakis, N; Lefebvre, L				Nicolakakis, N; Lefebvre, L			Forebrain size and innovation rate in European birds: Feeding, nesting and confounding variables	BEHAVIOUR			English	Article							BRAIN	Previous work has shown a positive correlation between relative forebrain size and feeding innovation Frequency, corrected for species number, over different taxonomic groups of birds. Several confounding variables could account for this relationship: ornithologists could notice and report innovations more often in certain taxa because of biased expectations, greater research effort, editorial bias in journals or large population sizes of the taxa. The innovation-forebrain correlation could also be spuriously caused by phylogeny or juvenile development mode. We examined these possibilities by entering species number per taxon, population size, number of full length papers, expectations (assessed by a questionnaire). journal source and development mode in multiple regressions that also included relative forebrain size. We did this with anti without phylogenetic corrections and tested two behavioural categories, feeding and nesting, where flexibility and learning are clearly thought to differ but confounds should have similar effects. Through an exhaustive survey covering 30 years in 11 journals, a total of 683 innovations was gathered fur the northwestern part of Europe, 507 for feeding and 176 for nesting. Species number per taxon was the only significant confound for both feeding and nesting reports; as predicted, forebrain size was a second significant predictor for feeding innovations, bur not fur nesting. The frequency of feeding innovations in the short notes of ornithology journals thus appears to be a valid and reliable way to operationalise behavioural flexibility in birds.

To test whether cortical adaptive responses contribute to the maintenance of normal motor function in patients with multiple sclerosis, we performed MRSI and functional MRI (fMRI) examinations of nine multiple sclerosis patients who had unimpaired hand function. We found that activation of the ipsilateral sensorimotor cortex with simple hand movements was increased by a mean of fivefold relative to normal controls (n = 8) and that the extent. of this increase was strongly correlated (sigma = -0.93, P = 0.001) with decreases in brain NAA, These results suggest that compensatory cortical adaptive responses may help to account for the limited relationship between conventional MRI measures of lesion burden and clinical measures of disability, and that therapies directed towards promoting cortical reorganization in response to brain injury could enhance recovery from relapses of multiple sclerosis.

Go-administration of CGRP(8-37) (4 mug) or BIBN4096BS (0.05, 0.1 mug) with morphine (15 mug) prevented the decline of antinociceptive effect and increase in ED50 value in the tailflick test. Intrathecal administration of the CGRP receptor antagonists did not alter the baseline responses in either tests. Acute CGRPs(8-37) also did not potentiate the acute actions of spinal morphine. 3 In animals rendered tolerant to intrathecal morphine, subsequent administration of CGRP(8-37) (4 mug) with morphine (15 mug) partially restored the antinociceptive effect and EDS, value of acute morphine, reflecting the reversal of tolerance. 4 Animals tolerant to intrathecal morphine expressed increased CGRP and substance P-like immunostaining in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. The increase in CGRP, but not substance P-like immunostaining, was blocked by a co-treatment with CGRP(8.37) (4 mug). In animals already tolerant to morphine, the increase in CGRP but not substance P-like immunostaining was partially reversed by CGRP(8-37) (4 mug). 5 These data suggest that activation of spinal CGRP receptors contributes to both the development and expression of spinal opioid tolerance. CGRP receptor antagonists may represent a useful therapeutic approach for preventing as well as reversing opioid tolerance.

Material and methods: Twelve patients with histopathologically confirmed GEM entered the study. There were nine males and three females, with median age of 48.8 years (range 30-75 years). Karnofsky performance status (KPS) was 60-70% for four patients and 80-100% for eight patients. Based on the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group recursive partition analysis, there were three class III patients, six class TV, one class V, and two class VI, Eleven patients underwent partial surgical tumor resection and one patient had a near complete resection, Two weeks post surgery, the patients were started on high dose TAM (120mg/ m(2) P.O. BID for three months). Two weeks from date of starting TAM, external beam radiotherapy (RT) was given at a dose of 59.4 Gy/33 qd fractions/6.5 weeks. Patients were assessed weekly for toxicity during treatment. Imaging studies were done at the end of two weeks of TAM, then monthly. Results: Median follow-up was 40 weeks (range 22-84 weeks). In one patient, TAM was associated with significant vomiting, necessitating the TAM dose to be decreased at three weeks and then stopped at two months. One other patient had bilateral deep venous thrombosis after 51/2 weeks on TAM, although the relationship to TAM was not firmly established. There were no radiological responses after two weeks of TAM or at the end of RT. The median time to progression was 17.7 weeks (range 5.1-43.8 weeks). Median survival time was 33.4 weeks (range 10-79.7), Actuarial survival at 48 and 74 weeks was 40% and 15%, respectively. Conclusion: Our study shows that adjuvant high dose TAM is feasible and relatively well-tolerated. Furthermore, the combined use of high dose TAM and RT postoperatively was not associated with any significant increase in radiation-induced neurological toxicity. However, high dose TAM does not appear to improve treatment results.

J	Leblanc, R				Leblanc, R			Familial adenomatous polyposis and benign intracranial tumors: A new variant of Gardner's syndrome	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF NEUROLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article							TURCOTS-SYNDROME; COLI; MANIFESTATIONS; LINKAGE	Introduction: Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is associated with malignant tumors of the central nervous system, predominantly medulloblastomas and glioblastoma multiforme (Turcot's syndrome) and with craniofacial osteomas (Gardner's syndrome). This report details the occurrence of benign, intracranial tumors in two related individuals with Gardner's syndrome, an association not previously described. Patients and methods: A 57-year-old woman (the propositus), her sister, two of her nieces and one of her grandnephews were previously diagnosed with Gardner's syndrome. The propositus came to neurosurgical attention because of vertigo associated with what proved to be an epidermoid cyst of the cerebellopontine angle. Her unaffected children and her relatives with Gardner's syndrome were examined and underwent computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. Results: A 39-year-old woman with Gardner's syndrome, the niece of the propositus, was found to harbor an asymptomatic left frontal meningioma. Discussion: Familial adenomatous polyposis, Gardner's syndrome, and that variant of Turcot's syndrome in which medulloblastoma predominate, are associated with a mutation of the adenomatous polyposis coli gene. The demonstration that patients with Gardner's syndrome can also have benign, nonneuroglial, intracranial tumors adds to the previously known extracolonic lesions associated with FAP. The molecular characterization of our patients should reveal if benign intracranial tumors represent a pleiotropic manifestation of the adenomatous polyposis coli gene mutation or if other genes are implicated.

This effect is paradoxical, since nicotine alone tends to increase nigrostriatal dopamine release. In the present experiments, a pro-cataleptic effect of nicotine was confirmed statistically but was small and variable. Three potential mechanisms underlying this effect were investigated. (i) Desensitization of brain nicotinic receptors appears to make little if any contribution to the pro-cataleptic effect of nicotine, insofar as the latter was not mimicked by two centrally active nicotinic antagonists (mecamylamine and chlorisondamine). (ii) Depolarization inactivation resulting from combined treatment with haloperidol and nicotine does not appear to be critical, since the pro-cataleptic effect of nicotine was not enhanced by chronic haloperidol administration, a treatment designed to enhance depolarization inactivation. (iii) The slow emergence and persistence of the acute pro-cataleptic effect of nicotine suggested possible mediation by a nicotine metabolite. However, neither cotinine nor nornicotine, the principal pharmacologically-active metabolites of nicotine, exerted a significant pro-cataleptic effect. In conclusion, the pro-cataleptic effect of nicotine was weak and variable in the present study, and its mechanism remains obscure.

Whereas the exact etiology of MTS is still controversial, several reports suggest that this pathologic lesion is both the cause and the consequence of chronic seizures and develops progressively during childhood secondary to recurrent seizures. In order to evaluate the clinical importance of MTS in children, we retrospectively reviewed the clinical charts of children who underwent surgery for medically intractable temporal epilepsy and report cases presenting an amygdalo-hippocampic dual pathology. Six children aged 1.5-16 years (mean+/-SD: 7.5+/-3 years) presenting with partial complex seizures (5 cases) or extension spasms (1 case), with onset from 6 months to the age of 8.5 years (mean seizure onset+/-SD: 3+/-5 years) underwent anterior temporal lobectomy including resection of the amygdala and hippocampus. All patients exhibited variable degrees of severity of neuronal loss and gliosis in the amygdala and/or hippocampus. The pathological picture of MTS was not isolated, however. Careful pathological examination has thus shown foci of amygdalo-hippocampic neuronal dysplasia in six patients, with concomitant bilaminated fascia dentata in two cases. Postoperatively, no mortality or morbidity was encountered. After a mean follow-up of 2.5 years, four patients are seizure free. One patient had a 80% rate of improvement in seizure frequency, though still having occasional febrile convulsions. In another patient, complex partial seizures resolved, but rare episodes of absence were still observed. These data are in keeping with the hypothesis that MTS could be secondary to repeated seizures. The analysis of this series of patients could suggest that mesiotemporal dysplastic lesions within the amygdalo-hippocampic structures induce seizures, which, in turn, will favor the development of MTS during childhood. MTS could then lead to synaptic reorganization, which can express abnormal hyperexcitability and result in more recurrent seizures. In this way a vicious circle is set up, which may explain the progression of seizures in some patients.

Both vertebrate and invertebrate Sim family members were found sufficient for the activation of the Shh reporter as well as endogenous Shh mRNA, Although Shh expression is maintained in Sim2(-/-) embryos, it was determined to be absent from the rostral midbrain and caudal diencephalon of embryos carrying a dominant-negative transgene that disrupts the function of bNLH-PAS proteins. Together, these results suggest that bHLH-PAS family members are required for the regulation of Shh transcription within aspects of the ventral midbrain and diencephalon.

Artificial grammar learning by infants: an auto-associator perspective	DEVELOPMENTAL SCIENCE			English	Article								This paper reviews a recent article suggesting that infants use a system of algebraic rules to learn an artificial grammar (Marcus, Vijayan, Bandi Rao & Vishton, Rule learning by seven-month-old infants. Science, 183 (1999), 77-80). In three reported experiments, infants exhibited increased responding to auditory strings that violated the pattern Of elements they were habituated to. We argue that a perceptual interpretation is more parsimonious, as well as more consistent with a broad array of habituation data, and we report successful neural network simulations that implement this lower-level interpretation. In the discussion, we discuss how our model relates to other habituation research, and how it compares to other neural network models of habituation in general, and models of the Marcus et al. (1999) task specifically.

The study participants were selected from a random sample of the elderly population (greater than or equal to 70 years of age) of the Saguenay-lac-Saint-Jean region (Quebec). Sixty-eight cases of Alzheimers disease diagnosed according to recognized criteria were paired for age (+/-2 years) and sex with nondemented controls. Aluminum speciation was assessed using established standard analytical protocols along with quality control procedures. Exposure to Al forms (total Al, total dissolved AI, monomeric organic AI, monomeric inorganic Al, polymeric Al, Al3+, AlOH, AIF, AlH3SiO42-, AlSO4) in drinking water was estimated by juxtaposing the subject's residential history with the physicochemical data of the municipalities. The markers of longterm exposures (1945 to onset) to AZ forms in drinking water were not significantly associated with AD. On the other hand, after adjustment for education level, presence of family cases, and ApoE epsilon4 allele, exposure to organic monomeric aluminum estimated at the onset of the disease was associated with AD (odds ratio 2.67; 95% CI 1.04-6.90). On average, the exposure estimated at the onset had been stable for 44 years. Our results confirm prime the importance of estimation of Al speciation and consideration of genetic characteristics in the assessment of the association between aluminum exposure and Alzheimer's disease.

The brain and the rostral portion of the spinal cord were exposed in vitro, while the intact caudal two-thirds of the body swam freely in the Ringer's-containing chamber. Electrical microstimulation (2-10 Hz; 0.1-5.0 muA) within a small periventricular region in the caudal mesencephalon elicited well-coordinated and controlled swimming that began within a few seconds after the onset of stimulation and lasted throughout the stimulation period. Swimming stopped several seconds after the end of stimulation. The power of swimming, expressed by the strength of the muscle contractions and the frequency and the amplitude of the lateral displacement of the body or tail, increased as the intensity or frequency of the stimulating current were increased. Micro-injection of AMPA, an excitatory amino acid agonist, into the MLR also elicited active swimming. Electrical stimulation of the MLR elicited large EPSPs in reticulospinal neurons (RS) of the middle rhombencephalic reticular nucleus (MRRN), which also displayed rhythmic activity during swimming. The retrograde tracer cobalt-lysine was injected into the MRRN and neurons (dia. 10-20 mum) were labelled in the MLR, indicating that this region projects to the rhombencephalic reticular formation. Taken together, the present results indicate that, as higher vertebrates, lampreys possess a specific mesencephalic region that controls locomotion, and the effects onto the spinal cord are relayed by brainstem RS neurons.

Cell viability was evaluated by the mitochondrial dehydrogenase activity and confirmed by propidium iodide (PI) fluorescence staining. The expression of the 72 kDa stress protein, HSP72, was assayed by Western blot analysis. The results showed that Cd2+-induced toxicity was dependent on the rime and dose of exposure, as well as on the developmental stage of the cultures. Oligodendrocyte progenitors were more vulnerable to Cd-24 toxicity than were mature oligodendrocytes. Mature oligodendrocytes accumulated relatively higher levels of Cd2+ than did progenitors, as determined by (CdCl2)-Cd-109 uptake; treatment with the metal ion caused a more pronounced reduction in intracellular glutathione levels and significantly higher free radical accumulation in progenitors. The latter could explain the observed differences in Cd2+ susceptibility. HSP72 protein expression was increased both in progenitors and in mature cells exposed to Cd2+ Pretreatment with N-acetylcysteine, a thiocompound with antioxidant activity and a precursor of glutathione, prevented Cd2+-induced (i) reduction in glutathione levels and (ii) induction of HSP72 and diminished (i) Cd2+ uptake and (ii) Cd2+-evoked cell death. In contrast, buthionine sulfoximine, an inhibitor of gamma -glutamyl-cysteine synthetase, depleted glutathione, and potentiated the toxic effect of Cd2+. These results strongly suggest that Cd2+-induced cytotoxicity in oligodendrocytes is mediated by reactive oxygen species and is modulated by glutathione levels. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Inc.

Our review is based on 55 studies of EMG gradients, which were published during the period 1937-1994. The extremely wide diversity of situations yielding EMG gradients suggests the possibility that these gradients may be universal accompaniments of organized goal-directed behavioral sequences, overt and covert. Motor tasks and cognitive tasks (without any requirements for motor output) were found to have this in common: they both produced EMG gradients. EMG gradients were not observed during simple, repetitive exercises. On the efferent side, we propose a dual model for the production of EMG gradients, which is based on empirical findings. This model is discussed in relation to current views on central and peripheral neural control of muscle contractions, and on the electrical properties of extrafusal and intrafusal muscle fibers, with particular reference to surface electromyography. The complex relations between EMG gradient steepness and mental effort seemed well represented by the dual model, which was also useful in the interpretation of certain EMG gradients that were found in patients with anxiety disorders, tension-type headaches, and auditory hallucinations, respectively. On the afferent side, drawing on data from human and animal studies, we consider the evidence for movement-related brain activity generated by proprioceptive input, in relation to different types of feedback to the central nervous system during tasks that produce EMG gradients.

To examine the distribution of neurotrophins (NTs) and their catalytic receptors in adult rat photoreceptors. METHODS. Immunocytochemistry and Western blot analyses were performed using primary antibodies raised against NTs (nerve growth factor [NGF], brain-derived neurotrophic factor [BDNF], NT-3, and NT-4/5) and NT receptors (TrkA, TrkB, TrkC, and p75NTR). Double-labeling of retinal sections with opsin-specific antibodies was performed to identify each photoreceptor type. Competitive experiments using excess recombinant NT or Trk receptors confirmed the binding specificity of each antibody. RESULTS. TrkB and BDNF immunoreactivity was colocalized in cone outer segments. TrkB and BDNF mere detected in all green-red-sensitive cones, but not in blue-UV cones or rods, and other NTs and NT receptors were not detected in any of the photoreceptor types. CONCLUSIONS. The findings suggest a specific role for BDNF through its signaling receptor TrkB in the function and maintenance of green-red cones, the predominant cone type in the rat retina.

In lysosomes, prosaposin is the precursor of 4 activator proteins, designated saposins A, B, C, and D, which promote by acidic hydrolases, the degradation of glycosphingolipids with short oligosaccharide chains. Mutations of the prosaposin gene have been linked to several lysosomal storage disorders. An animal model was recently developed by creating a null allele in embryonic stem cells through gene targeting in order to investigate the phenotypic diversity of prosaposin mutations, the involvement of this protein in lysosomal storage diseases, and to develop potential therapeutic approaches. Mutant homozygous mice die at 35-40 days of age and neurological disorders contribute to their early death. Secreted prosaposin is present in milk and in cerebrospinal and seminal fluids. In the nervous system, prosaposin exhibits a trophic activity. Examination of reproduc-tive organs in homozygous mutant males shows several abnormalities such as a decrease in testis size with reduced spermiogenesis, and an involution of the prostate, seminal vesicle, and epididymis, although levels of testosterone in blood remain normal. In the prostate of homozygous mutants, only basal cells appear to be present, whereas secretory cells are absent. The epithelia in efferent ducts is formed by ciliated cells, whereas heterozygotes exhibit a majority of nonciliated cells. Our data indicate that prosaposin is involved in the development and maintenance of male reproductive organs. In prostatic epithelium, targeted disruption of the prosaposin gene appears to inactivate the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway and to interfere with differentiation of secretory cells.

In the current experiment, we examined the utility of hierarchical models in characterising musical information processing in autistic individuals. Participants were 13 high-functioning individuals with autism and 13 individuals of normal intelligence matched on chronological age, nonverbal IQ, and laterality, and without musical experience. The task consisted of same-different judgements of pairs of melodies. Differential local and global processing was assessed by manipulating the level, local or global, at which modifications occurred. No deficit was found in the two measures of global processing. In contrast, the clinical group performed better than the comparison group in the detection of change in nontransposed, contour-preserved melodies that tap local processing. These findings confirm the existence of a "local bias" in music perception in individuals with autism, but challenge the notion that it is accounted for by a deficit in global music processing. The present study suggests that enhanced processing of elementary physical properties of incoming stimuli, as found previously in the visual modality, may also exist in the auditory modality.

We propose here a novel single cell-based assay for identification of these ligands. This assay involves (a) fluorescent tagging of the GPCR, (b) expression of the tagged receptor in a heterologous expression system, (c) incubation of the transfected cells with fractions purified from tissue extracts, and (d) imaging of ligand-induced receptor internalization by confocal microscopy coupled to digital image quantification. We tested this approach in CHO cells stably expressing the NT1 neurotensin receptor fused to EGFP (enhanced green fluorescent protein), in which neurotensin promoted internalization of the NT1-EGFP receptor in a dose-dependent fashion (EC50 = 0.98 nM). Similarly, four of 120 consecutive reversed-phase HPLC fractions of frog brain extracts promoted internalization of the NT1-EG FP receptor. The same four fractions selectively contained neurotensin, an endogenous ligand of the NT1 receptor, as detected by radioimmunoassay and inositol phosphate production.

This would enable clinicians to determine the importance of symmetry in the pathophysiology of musculoskeletal disorders and to assess the efficacy of devices and treatments claiming to normalize or improve posture. In this investigation, the efficacy of such a device, a set of insoles with a hypothesized proprioceptive-like action, was evaluated through use of the described procedure. Objectives: To develop a new scoring system to evaluate body posture on the basis of symmetry and to use this scoring system to investigate the efficacy of insoles containing a combination of mineral derivatives designed to balance posture through a neurophysiological effect. Methods: The posture score was based on the evaluation of 4 postural parameters: pelvic and shoulder lateral balance/imbalance, static shoulder rotation, and amplitude of head rotation. In the placebo-controlled study, 32 patients were tested in a double-blind fashion, either with placebo insoles or with insoles containing mineral derivatives. The same study was repeated in unblind conditions in 137 patients selected from 2 chiropractic clinics in an open-label protocol. Study Designs: A crossover placebo-controlled, double-blind study and a multicenter, large-scale, open-label study in patients selected from chiropractic clinics. Results: A basal postural evaluation in 137 patients revealed that no patient had a perfect symmetry-ie, a perfectly or nearly perfectly balanced posture. The insoles with mineral derivatives induced a highly significant and similar improvement in the postural score in both the crossover double-blind study (32 patients; 56.7% improvement) and the open-label study (137 patients; 60.7% improvement, P < .001). Conclusions: All patients tested and selected in chiropractic clinics exhibited asymmetries and postural imbalances according to the newly developed scoring method, and this method was successful in assessing the efficacy of insoles exerting a profound and immediate postural effect through a hypothesized neurophysiological mode of action.

In situ hybridization performed in mice during prenatal and postnatal development and in adulthood revealed the coexpression of beta-APP, BACE, and ADAM10. The patterns of BACE2 and ADAM17 only partially overlapped with that of beta-APP. beta-APP, BACE, and ADAM10 mRNAs have also been detected by northern blot in human brain cortex of normal subjects and in Alzheimer's disease subjects. In situ hybridization performed using combined biotin- and radiolabeled riboprobes provided evidence for the coexpression of beta-APP with BACE and ADAM10 in human cortical neurons. Our data provide cytochemical evidence supporting the role of ADAM10 and BACE as authentic alpha- and beta-secretases.

The majority of neurons (102/108) were physiologically identified as medium spiny (MS) projection neurons, and only these were subjected to detailed analysis. The remaining neurons displayed characteristics suggesting that they were not MS neurons. Around the time of birth and during the first postnatal weeks, the membrane and firing characteristics of MS neurons were quite different from those observed later. These characteristics changed rapidly during the first 3 postnatal weeks, at which point they began to resemble those found in adults. Both whole cell membrane resistance and membrane time constant decreased more than fourfold during the period studied. The resting membrane potential (RMP) also changed significantly from an average of -50 mV around birth to less than -80 mV by the end of the third postnatal week. During the first postnatal week, the current-voltage relationship of all encountered MS neurons was linear over a wide range of membrane potentials above and below RMP. Through the second postnatal week, the proportion of neurons displaying inward rectification in the hyperpolarized range increased steadily and after P15, all recorded MS neurons displayed significant inward rectification. At all ages, inward rectification was blocked by extracellular cesium and tetra-ethyl ammonium and was not changed by 4-aminopyridine; this shows that inward rectification was mediated by the same currents in young and mature MS neurons. MS neurons fired single and repetitive Na+/K+ action potentials as early as P1. Spike threshold and amplitude remained constant throughout development in contrast to spike duration, which decreased significantly over the same period. Depolarizing current pulses from rest showed that immature MS neurons fired action potentials more easily than their older counterparts. Taken together, the results from the present study suggest that young and adult nAcb MS neurons integrate excitatory synaptic inputs differently because of differences in their membrane and firing properties. These findings provide important insights into signal processing within nAcb during this critical period of development.

J	Matsuyama, K; Drew, T				Matsuyama, K; Drew, T			Vestibulospinal and reticulospinal neuronal activity during locomotion in the intact cat. I. Walking on a level surface	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article							LATERAL VESTIBULAR NUCLEUS; MEDIAL LONGITUDINAL FASCICULUS; VOLUNTARY GAIT MODIFICATIONS; SPINAL LESIONS; RETICULAR-FORMATION; BRAIN-STEM; PHA-L; CORTICORETICULAR PATHWAYS; UNRESTRAINED WALKING; PERICRUCIATE CORTEX	To examine the function of descending brain stem pathways in the control of locomotion, we have characterized the discharge patterns of identified vestibulo- and reticulospinal neurons (VSNs and RSNs, respectively) recorded from the lateral vestibular nucleus (LVN) and the medullary reticular formation (MRF), during treadmill walking. Data during locomotion were obtained for 44 VSNs and for 63 RSNs. The discharge frequency of most VSNs (42/44) was phasically modulated in phase with the locomotor rhythm and the averaged peak discharge frequency ranged from 41 to 165 Hz (mean = 92.8 Hz). We identified three classes of VSNs based on their discharge pattern. Type A, or double peak, VSNs (20/44 neurons, 46%) showed two peaks and two troughs of activity in each step cycle. One of the peaks was time-locked to the activity of extensor muscles in the ipsilateral hindlimb while the other occurred anti-phase to this period of activity. Type B, or single pause, neurons (13/44 neurons, 30%) were characterized by a tonic or irregular discharge that was interrupted by a single pronounced and brief period of decreased activity that occurred just before the onset of swing in the ipsilateral hindlimb; some type B VSNs also exhibited a brief pulse of activity just preceding this decrease. Type C, or single peak, neurons (9/44 neurons, 23%) exhibited a single period of increased activity that, in most cells, was time-locked to the burst of activity of either extensor or flexor muscles of a single limb. The population of RSNs that we recorded included neurons that showed phasic activity related to the activity of flexor or extensor muscles [electromyographically (EMG) related, 26/63, 41%], those that were phasically active but whose activity was not time-locked to the activity of any of the recorded muscles (13/63, 21%) and those that were completely unrelated to locomotion (24/63, 38%). Most of the EMG-related RSNs showed one (15/26) or two (11/26) clear phasic bursts of activity that were temporally related to either flexor or extensor muscles. The discharge pattern of double-burst RSNs covaried with ipsilateral and contralateral flexor muscles. Peak averaged discharge activity in these EMG-related RSNs ranged from 4 to 98 Hz (mean = 35.2 Hz). We discuss the possibility that most VSNs regulate the overall activity of extensor muscles in the four limbs while RSNs provide a more specific signal that has the flexibility to modulate the activity of groups of flexor and extensor muscles, in either a single or in multiple limbs.

Walking on an inclined plane	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article							MEDULLARY RETICULAR-FORMATION; VOLUNTARY GAIT MODIFICATIONS; MOTOR CORTICAL ACTIVITY; DECEREBRATE CAT; FUNCTIONAL-ORGANIZATION; VESTIBULAR REFLEXES; UNANESTHETIZED CAT; FICTIVE LOCOMOTION; VERTICAL PLANES; PHA-L	The experiments described in this report were designed to determine the contribution of vestibulospinal neurons (VSNs) in Deiters' nucleus and of reticulospinal neurons (RSNs) in the medullary reticular formation to the modifications of the walking pattern that are associated with locomotion on an inclined plane. Neuronal discharge patterns were recorded from 44 VSNs and 63 RSNs in cats trained to walk on a treadmill whose orientation was varied from +20 degrees (uphill) to -10 degrees (downhill), referred to as pitch tilt, and from 20 degrees roll tilt left to 20 degrees roll tilt right. During uphill locomotion, a majority of VSNs (25/44) and rhythmically active RSNs (24/39) showed an increase in peak discharge frequency, above that observed during locomotion on a level surface. VSNs, unlike some of the RSNs, exhibited no major deviations from the overall pattern of the activity recorded during level walking. The relative increase in discharge frequency of the RSNs (on average, 31.8%) was slightly more than twice that observed in the VSNs (on average, 14.4%), although the average absolute change in discharge frequency was similar (18.2 Hz in VSNs and 21.6 Hz in RSNs). Changes in discharge frequency during roll tilt were generally more modest and were more variable, than those observed during uphill locomotion as were the relative changes in the different limb muscle electromyograms that we recorded. In general, discharge frequency in VSNs was more frequently increased when the treadmill was rolled to the right (ear down contralateral to the recording site) than when it was rolled to the left. Most VSNs that showed significant linear relationships with treadmill orientation in the roll plane increased their activity during right roll and decreased activity during left roll. Discharge activity in phasically modulated RSNs was also modified by roll tilt of the treadmill. Modulation of activity in RSNs that discharged twice in each step cycle was frequently reciprocal in that one burst of activity would increase during left roll and the other during right roll. The overall results indicate that each system contributes to the changes in postural tone that are required to adapt the gait for modification on an inclined surface. The characteristics of the discharge activity of the VSNs suggest a role primarily in the overall control of the level of electromyographic activity, while the characteristics of the RSNs suggest an additional role in determining the relative level of different muscles, particularly when the pattern is asymmetric.

The cellular bases of locomotion have been extensively studied in lampreys where reticulospinal (RS) neurons constitute the main descending system activating and controlling the spinal locomotor networks. Ca2+ imaging and intracellular recordings were used to study the pattern of activation of RS neurons in response to cutaneous stimulation. Pressure applied to the skin evoked a linear input/output relationship in RS neurons until a threshold level, at which a depolarizing plateau was induced, the occurrence of which was associated with the onset of swimming activity in a semi-intact preparation. The occurrence of a depolarizing plateau was abolished by blocking the NMDA receptors that are located on RS cells. Moreover, the depolarizing plateaus were accompanied by a rise in [Ca2+](i), and an intracellular injection of the Ca2+ chelator BAPTA into single RS cells abolished the plateaus, suggesting that the latter are Ca2+ dependent and rely on intrinsic properties of RS cells. The plateaus were shown to result from the activation of a Ca2+-activated nonselective cation current that maintains the cell in a depolarized state. It is concluded that this intrinsic property of the RS neuron is then responsible for the transformation of an incoming sensory signal into a motor command that is then forwarded to the spinal locomotor networks.

There is convincing evidence in these studies that the NMDA receptor mediates prolonged nociceptive behaviors in animal models and various chronic pain symptoms in the clinical population. Administration of older compounds, such as ketamine, dextromethorphan, and amantadine, which are now known to act as NMDA receptor antagonists, have recently been shown to alleviate chronic pain. For years, the pharmaceutical industry has been attempting to produce novel compounds that modulate NMDA receptor activity; however, the adverse effects associated with this class of drugs have prevented their widespread clinical use. Collaborative studies between basic researchers, clinical scientists, and clinicians are needed to delineate characteristics of NMDA receptor antagonism that predict optimal analgesic activity and an acceptable toxicity profile in patients with chronic pain.

The Pediatric Oncology Group conducted a phase II study to determine the activity of PZA administered as a 3-hour infusion. Patients and Methods: The activity of PZA was evaluated in patients with a variety of childhood solid tumors including rhabdomyosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma/peripheral neuroectodermal tumor, neuroblastoma, osteogenic sarcoma, Wilms tumor, or other solid tumors (excluding brain tumors). In addition to a standard three-stage design to test the drug's activity in each tumor type, a global stopping rule was used such that if no complete or partial responses (CR or PR) occurred in the first 35 patients (pooled across all strata except "other"), the study would be closed. Results: A total of 47 patients were entered into the study. Myelosuppression was the primary toxicity. Severe nonhematologic toxicity was uncommon. Only one patient exhibited grade 3 neurologic toxicity (anxiety). No CRs or PRs were observed. Conclusion: Use of the global stopping criterion permitted early identification of lack of activity of PZA against childhood solid tumors.

Methods: During an 18-month period, all children <5 years of age, who were consecutively referred to pediatric neurology or developmental pediatric clinics at a single tertiary pediatric center, were prospectively enrolled. Etiologic yield was determined after completion of clinical assessments and selected laboratory studies requested by the evaluating physician. Results: Seventy-two children (60 boys) were found to have a developmental language disorder, and 22 children (11 boys) had isolated motor delay, of whom 6 had an associated diagnosis of cerebral palsy. An etiologic diagnosis was rarely made in the children with developmental language disorder (3/72, 4.1%). Laboratory investigations (metabolic, cytogenetic, imaging), aside from audiometry, were uniformly uninformative. In those children with isolated motor delay, an etiology was apparent in more than half (13/22, 59%). Slightly more than half (7/13, 54%) of etiologies identified in this group were potentially preventable. Successful etiologic determination in children viith motor delay often had an impact on recurrence risk estimation, medical management, or specific therapy offered (8/13, 62%). The presence of physical findings on initial assessment was found to be highly predictive of successful etiologic determination in children with isolated motor delay (13/17 vs 0/5, P = .002). Conclusion: Etiologic yield differs substantially according to the subgroup of single domain developmental delay.

Objective: To describe the preoperative and postoperative neurodevelopmental status of newborns and infants with CHDs. Study design: One hundred thirty-one children (56 newborns and 75 infants) were evaluated before and after surgery by using standardized neurobehavioral (newborn) and motor assessments (infant) and neurologic examinations. Results: In newborns, neurobehavioral abnormalities were documented in >50% before surgery, with abnormalities persisting in most after surgery. In infants, neurodevelopmental abnormalities were observed in 38% before surgery. There was a significant association between preoperative and postoperative neurodevelopmental status, with status remaining unchanged in most. Newborns with acyanotic heart lesions were more likely to demonstrate neurologic compromise than those with cyanotic defects. For infants, arterial oxygen saturations <85%, were significantly associated with an abnormality. There was a trend for a longer circulatory arrest time to be associated with greater risk for neurologic sequelae in newborns, whereas prolonged cardiopulmonary bypass was an important risk factor for infants. Conclusions: Neurodevelopmental abnormalities are common in young infants with CHDs and are often present before open heart surgery. These developmental concerns are clinically underappreciated. Early systematic developmental screening may be warranted in this population of interest.

Recently, transgenic mouse approaches have been used to address whether cytoskeletal changes may contribute to motor neuron disease. Mice lacking one of the three NF subunits are viable and do not develop motor neuron disease. Nonetheless, mice with null mutations for NF-L or for both NF-M and NF-H genes developed severe atrophy of ventral and dorsal root axons. The atrophic process is associated with hind limb paralysis during aging in mice deficient for both NF-M and NF-H proteins. The overexpression in mice of transgenes coding for wild-type or mutant NF proteins can provoke abnormal NF accumulations, axonal atrophy and sometimes motor dysfunction. However, the perikaryal NF accumulations are generally well tolerated by motor neurons and, except for expression of a mutant NF-L transgene, they did not provoke massive motor neuron death. Increasing the levels of perikaryal NF proteins may even confer protection in motor neuron disease caused by ALS-linked mutations in the superoxide dismutase (SOD1). In contrast, the overexpression of wild-type peripherin, a type of IF gene upregulated by inflammatory cytokines. provoked the formation of toxic IF inclusions with the high-molecular-weight NF proteins resulting in the death of motor neurons during aging. These results together with the detection of peripherin inclusions at early stage of disease in mice expressing mutant SOD1 suggest that IF inclusions containing peripherin may play a contributory role in ALS pathogenesis.

Materials and Methods: Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 250 to 300 gm. were anesthetized with pentobarbital and placed in a stereotaxic apparatus after catheterization of the carotid artery and insertion of a 25 gauge needle in the corpus cavernosum. Both catheters were coupled to pressure transducer systems. Electrical stimulations with glass tungsten microelectrodes and chemical injections with a 0.5 mu l. syringe were done in the paraventricular nucleus. At the end of each experiment rats were perfused with saline and 10% formalin solutions. Brains slices 16 mu m. thick were mounted and stained with cresyl violet to identify chemical and electrical stimulation sites. Results: Electrical stimulations of the paraventricular nucleus increased intracavernous pressure from 15.5 +/- 5.7 to 50.02 +/- 20.4 cm. H2O in 10 rats (p <0.001) and decreased central pressure in 10 (p <0.001). Intracavernous pressure increased from 17.2 +/- 5.26 to 60.6 +/- 14.36 cm. H2O with NMDA, 26.0 +/- 8.9 to 49.6 +/- 12.2 cm. H2O with AMPA and 18.0 +/- 2.3 to 41.0 +/- 22.68 cm. H2O with ACPD when injected in the paraventricular nucleus of 5 rats (analysis of variance 12.18, df 3, p <0.007). Mean delays and durations varied between 3.6 to 4.0 and 5.6 to 7.0, respectively, and were similar for all agonists (analysis of variance not significant). Conclusions: Glutamate receptor subtypes NMDA, ACPD and AMPA cause an increase in intracavernous pressure when injected in the paraventricular nucleus. Therefore, increases in intracavernous pressure following injection of glutamate must be initiated by the synergistic or additive effects of all of these receptor subtypes.

HIP1 shows homology to S1a2p, a protein essential for the assembly and function of the cytoskeleton and endocytosis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We have determined that the HIP1 gene comprises 32 exons spanning approximately 215 kb of genomic DNA and gives rise to two alternate splice forms termed HIP1-1 and HIP1-2. Additionally, we have identified a novel protein termed HIP12 with significant sequence and biochemical similarities to HIP1 and high sequence similarity to S1a2p. HIP12 differs from HIP1 in its pattern of expression both at the mRNA and protein level. However, HIP1 and HIP12 are both found within the brain and show a similar subcellular distribution pattern. In contrast to HIP1, which is toxic in cell culture, HIP12 does not confer toxicity in the same assay systems. Interestingly, HIP12 does not interact with huntingtin but can interact with HIP 1, suggesting a potential interaction in vivo that may influence the function of each respective protein.

Within the retina, cells that respond to light increment and light decrement are separated into ON- and OFF-pathways. Hereditary diseases are known to disturb these retinal pathways, causing either progressive degeneration or stationary deficits(2). Congenital stationary night blindness (CSNB) is a group of stable retinal disorders that are characterized by abnormal night vision. Genetic subtypes of CSNB have been defined and different disease actions have been postulated(3-5). The molecular bases have been elucidated in several subtypes, providing a better understanding of the disease mechanisms and developmental retinal neurobiology(2). Here we have studied 22 families with 'complete' X-linked CSNB (CSNB1; MIM 310500; ref. 4) in which affected males have night blindness, some photopic vision loss and a defect of the ON-pathway. We have found 14 different mutations, including 1 founder mutation in 7 families from the United States, in a novel candidate gene, NYX. NYX, which encodes a glycosylphosphatidyl (GPI)-anchored protein called nyctalopin, is a new and unique member of the small leucine-rich proteoglycan (SLRP) family(6). The role of other SLRP proteins suggests that mutant nyctalopin disrupts developing retinal interconnections involving the ON-bipolar cells, leading to the visual losses seen in patients with complete CSNB.

Acute inflammatory events can be associated with reversible disability that may parallel reversible axonal injury. This in part accounts for the remission following relapses early in the disease. By the time there is clinical disability, substantial axonal injury already has occurred. This provides a strong rationale for the early limitation of inflammation and its consequences.

We discuss the clinical aspects, pathology, and molecular genetics of 7 patients with primitive neuroectodermal tumors (PNETs) arising in the brainstem that were treated at our institution from 1986 through 1995. Most neuro-oncologists avoid performing biopsies in children with pontine tumors. This article raises the question as to whether biopsies should be performed, because treatment recommendations might differ if a PNET was diagnosed rather than a pontine glioma. Patients and Methods. We reviewed the clinical neuro-oncology database and the files of the Division of Neuropathology at New York University Medical Center from 1986 through 1995 and identified 7 histologically confirmed PNETs arising in the brainstem among 146 pediatric brainstem tumors. The clinical, neuroradiological, and neuropathological data were reviewed. Postmortem examinations were performed in 2 cases. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor tissues were also available in 6 of 7 patients that were tested for p53 gene mutations using single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis. We also tested 9 cerebellar PNETs, 9 brainstem gliomas, and 3 normal brains for p53 gene mutations as controls. Results. All 7 patients presented with focal cranial nerve deficits, and 2 were also hemiparetic. The median age at diagnosis was 2.7 (1-8 years). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) characteristics included a focal intrinsic exophytic nonenhancing brainstem lesion that had low T1-weighted and high T2-weighted signals. Hydrocephalus was present in 5 patients at diagnosis, 3 of whom had leptomeningeal dissemination. Meningeal dissemination occurred later in the course of the disease in 3 other patients. Five children required shunts at diagnosis and another 2 at recurrence. Despite therapy, all 7 PNET patients died within 17 months of diagnosis with a mean survival of 8 (4-17) months. No mutation in the p53 gene was detected. Conclusions. Brainstem PNETs tend to arise at a younger age than brainstem gliomas and medulloblastomas. The MRI pattern suggests a localized rather than a diffuse intrinsic nonenhancing brainstem tumor. Like other PNETs, brainstem PNETs have a high predilection to disseminate within the central nervous system. The absence of p53 mutations is similar to other PNETs. Despite their origin close to the cerebellum, brainstem PNETs exhibit a more aggressive behavior and result in worse clinical outcomes than do cerebellar PNETs.

Two basic classification models, with a completely different foundation, are currently used to report disk herniations in imaging study reports. One is based on the morphology of the disk contour and the other on patho-anatomy. Trying to straddle the two is doomed to failure because this exercise defies formal logic. MR is currently the most accurate non-invasive imaging modality to diagnose a disk herniation and to determine its exact location. The determination of some patho-anatomical characteristics of herniated disks (type, composition) may require the use of CT, diskography, or CT-diskography.

This process serves a crucial role in receptor downregulation, resensitization, and transmembrane signaling. It has mainly been investigated in cells ectopically expressing recombinant receptors. In the present study, we investigated whether rat central neurons and astrocytes naturally expressing somatostatin (SRIF) receptors internalized this neuropeptide. We demonstrated that 29% of cortical and 45% of hippocampal neurons in culture expressed the SRIF receptor sst(2A) and that 40-50% of the neurons internalized fluorescent SRIF. Similarly, an important proportion of astrocytes expressed sst(2A) (up to 60% in cortical cultures) and internalized fluo-SRIF. Competition experiments using the sst(2)/sst(5)-preferring agonist SMS 201-995 (octreotide) showed that a subpopulation of neurons internalized fluo-SRIF via sst, and/or sst(5) receptors, but that others also did so via other subtypes. Fluo-SRIF labeling was barely competed for by the sst(1)-selective agonist CH-275, indicating that sst(1) was unlikely to be mediating SRIF internalization in hippocampal and cortical neurons. Given the paucity of sst, receptors in cerebral cortex and hippocampus and the poor yield of sst(4) internalization in transfected cells, we conclude that sst(2) and sst(3) subtypes are the most likely to be responsible for SRIF internalization in our culture systems.

J	Nguyen, MD; Lariviere, RC; Julien, JP				Nguyen, MD; Lariviere, RC; Julien, JP			Reduction of axonal caliber does not alleviate motor neuron disease caused by mutant superoxide dismutase 1	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase; neurofilaments; transgenic mice; knockout mice	AMYOTROPHIC-LATERAL-SCLEROSIS; HEAVY NEUROFILAMENT SUBUNIT; CALCIUM-BINDING PROTEINS; TRANSGENIC MOUSE MODEL; NF-H GENE; SPINAL-CORD; SELECTIVE VULNERABILITY; SOD1 MUTATION; UP-REGULATION; MICE LACKING	It is well established that motor neurons with large axon caliber are selectively affected in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). To investigate whether high neurofilament (NF) content and large axonal caliber are factors that predispose motor neurons to selective degeneration in ALS, we generated mice expressing a mutant form of superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1(G37R)) linked to familial ALS in a context of one allele for each NF gene being disrupted. A approximate to 40% decrease of NF protein content detected in triple heterozygous knockout mice shifted the calibers of large axons in L5 ventral root from 5-9 mum to 1-5 mum, altering neither the normal subunit stoichiometry and morphological distribution of NFs nor levels of other cytoskeletal proteins. This considerable reduction in NF burden and caliber of axons did not extend the life span of SOD1(G37R) mice nor did it alleviate the loss of motor axons, Moreover, increasing the density of NFs in axons by overexpressing a NF-L transgene did not accelerate disease in SOD1(G37R) mice. These results do not support the current view that high NF content and large caliber of axons may account for the selective vulnerability of motor neurons in ALS caused by mutant SOD1.

We have isolated partial cDNAs for five PSD-95 family members from Apteronotus leptorhynchus brain RNA using a degenerate PCR method. The amino acid sequences deduced indicate that A. leptorhynchus neurons express homologues of the mammalian PSD-93, SAP-97, and SAP-102 MAGUKs and two homologues of mammalian PSD-95. In situ hybridization experiments have been carried out to localize the cellular expression of all five MAGUK mRNAs in the central nervous system of A. leptorhynchus. In the cerebellum the expression patterns are highly similar to patterns reported for mammalian cerebellum, suggesting an evolutionary conservation of the functional roles in this gene family. Cellular levels of expression of the PSD-95 MAGUK mRNAs and the NMDAR-1 mRNA were highly correlated in neurons of the dorsal forebrain but were not correlated in neurons of the electrosensory lateral line lobe (ELL) or the cerebellum. These results suggest that the expression of PSD-95 MAGUK genes in forebrain neurons may provide mechanisms for synaptic organization that are not shared by neurons in the ELL and cerebellum. J.

The first set of probes was synthesized from mRNA isolated from visual brain areas MT and V4 of Vervet monkey. The second set of probes was derived from cDNA libraries constructed from two micro dissected sets of layers of the monkey Lateral Geniculate Nucleus layers within the visual pathway, namely the magnocellular and parvocellular layers. The third set of cDNA probes was synthesized from the subtracted fractions of the cDNAs enriched for either the magnocellular or the parvocellular layers of the Lateral Geniculate Nucleus. Software, linked directly to the Genbank database, was developed to aid in the rapid identification of bath expressed and differentially expressed genes. Our results indicate that both the cDNA probes synthesized from mRNA and cDNA libraries can identify similar fractions of expressed genes. However, the subtracted cDNA probes improve the efficiency of detection for those genes that are expressed at much lower abundance. Analyses of these results for the differential expression patterns of these genes were validated by semi-quantitative PCR on the DNA derived from the whole tissue cDNA libraries. A list of some known genes that are statistically differentially expressed within the magnacellular layers of the LGN and area MT in the primate visual areas is derived.

In the present study, the muscarinic (M) receptor antagonists atropine and scopolamine as well as the M2 receptor antagonist AF-DX 116, but not the preferential MI receptor antagonist pirenzepine, reduced the suppressant effect of the 5-HTIA receptor agonist 8-OH-DPAT on the spontaneous firing activity of rat dorsal raphe 5-HT neurons. Moreover, AF-64A-induced lesions of cholinergic neurons directly in the medial prefrontal cortex and after its i.c.v. injection attenuated the effect of 8-OH-DPAT. Finally, the NMDA receptor antagonist (+)MK-801 and the GABA(B) receptor antagonist SCH-50911, but not the GABA(A) receptor antagonist (-)bicuculline, dampened the latter response. The present study unveiled a key role for the cholinergic and GABAergic systems in the feedback inhibition of dorsal raphe 5-HT neurons.

It is an atypical apolipoprotein and, based on its primary structure, apoD is predicted to be a member of the lipocalin family. Lipocalins adopt a beta -barrel tertiary structure and transport small hydrophobic ligands. Although apoD can bind cholesterol, progesterone, pregnenolone, bilirubin and arachidonic acid, it is unclear if any, or all of these, represent its physiological ligands. The apoD gene is expressed in many tissues, with high levels of expression in spleen, testes and brain. ApoD is present at high concentrations in the cyst fluid of women with gross cystic disease of the breast, a condition associated with increased risk of breast cancer. It also accumulates at sites of regenerating peripheral nerves and in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with neurodegenerative conditions, such as Alzheimer's disease. ApoD may, therefore, participate in maintenance and repair within the central and peripheral nervous systems. While its role in metabolism has yet to be defined, apoD is likely to be a multi-ligand, multi-functional transporter. It could transport a ligand from one cell to another within an organ, scavenge a ligand within an organ for transport to the blood or could transport a ligand from the circulation to specific cells within a tissue.

The goals of our study were to determine the prevalence of delirium in emergency department (ED) patients aged 65 years and over and to determine the sensitivity and specificity of a conventional clinical assessment by an ED physician for the detection of delirium in the same population. Methods: All elderly patients presenting to the ED in a primary acute care, university-affiliated hospital who were triaged to the observation room on a stretcher because of the severity of their illness were screened for delirium by a research psychiatrist using the Mini-Mental State Examination and the Confusion Assessment Method. The diagnosis of "delirium" or an equivalent term by the ED physician was determined by 2 methods: completion of a mental status checklist by the ED physician and chart review. The prevalence of delirium and the sensitivity and specificity of the ED physician's clinical assessment were calculated with their 95% confidence intervals. The demographic and clinical characteristics of patients with detected delirium and those with undetected delirium were compared. Results: A sample of 447 patients was screened. The prevalence of delirium was 9.6% (95% confidence interval 6.9%-12.4%). The sensitivity of the detection of delirium by the ED physician was 35.3% and the specificity, 98.5%. Most patients with delirium had neurologic or pulmonary diseases, and most patients with detected delirium had neurologic diseases. Interpretation: Despite the relatively high prevalence of delirium in elderly ED patients, the sensitivity of a conventional clinical assessment for this condition is low. There is a need to improve the detection of delirium by ED physicians.

In this report, we test the hypothesis that pRb collaborates with basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors to regulate cortical neurogenesis, taking advantage of the naturally occurring dominant-inhibitory HLH protein Id2. Overexpression of Id2 in cortical progenitors completely inhibited the induction of neuron-specific genes and led to apoptosis, presumably as a consequence of conflicting differentiation signals. Both of these phenotypes were rescued by coexpression of a constitutively activated pRb mutant. In contrast, Id2 overexpression in postmitotic cortical neurons affected neither neuronal gene expression nor survival. Thus, pRb collaborates with HLHs to ensure the coordinate induction of terminal mitosis and neuronal gene expression as cortical progenitors become neurons.

To examine further the influence of TD on neuronal survival in relation to metabolic changes, primary cultures of rat cerebellar granule cells were exposed to thiamine-deficient medium for up to 7 days in the absence or presence of the central thiamine antagonist pyrithiamine (Py), Exposure of cells for 7 days to thiamine-deficient medium alone resulted in no detectable cell death. On the other hand, 50 mu M Py treatment led to reductions of thiamine phosphate esters, decreased activities of the thiamine-dependent enzymes alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase and transketolase, a twofold increase in lactate release (P < 0.001), a lowering of pH, and significant (58%, P < 0.001) cell death. DNA fragmentation studies did not reveal evidence of apoptotic cell death. Addition of 50 mu M alpha-tocopherol (vitamin E) or 100 mu M of butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) to Py-treated cells resulted in significant neuroprotection. On the other hand, addition of 10 mu M MK-801, an NMDA receptor antagonist, was not neuroprotective. These results suggest that reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a major role in thiamine deficiency-induced neuronal cell death. Insofar as this experimental model recapitulates the metabolic and mitochondrial changes characteristic of thiamine deficiency in the intact animal, it might be useful in the elucidation of mechanisms involved in the neuronal cell death cascade resulting from thiamine deficiency.

Results - Patients with Friedreich's ataxia had slowed information speed, as indicated by lengthened simple visual reaction time and increased color-word interference in the Stroop task. However, the patient group was not impaired in several tests sensitive to neocortical and particularly prefrontal cortex lesions, including an untimed version of block design, verbal fluency, Wisconsin card sorting, Tower of Hanoi, and picture arrangement. Despite serious sensorimotor dysfunctions, the patient group did not differ from controls in terms of mood. as evaluated by the Symptoms Checklist (SCL-90) and the Hamilton depression scale. Conclusion - These results indicate that the slowed information processing speed of patients with Friedreich's ataxia is not accompanied by major prefrontal cortex and mood disorders.

Chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia is a mitochondrial disease associated with deletions of mtDNA or by point mutation of tRNA genes. We tested the hypothesis that the cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2) may not rise in this disorder if the accompanying cerebral blood flow increase is insufficient. Two patients with progressive external ophthalmoplegia were visually stimulated with a colored checkerboard pattern reversing as different frequencies. When stimulated, Patient 1 had a small increase of cerebral blood flow, while Patient 2 had no cerebral blood flow increase. In the visually active state, the patients had no significant change of CMRO2, while healthy subjects had a pronounced increase of CMRO2 in the pericalcarine visual cortex at 4 Hz and a further slight increase at 8 Hz during activation.

Participants listened to prime-target pairs that shared word-initial phonology (e.g., definite-deaf), initial orthography (e.g., logic-log), both initial phonology and orthography (e.g., message-mess), or were unrelated (e.g., castle-green), presented at two different inter-stimulus intervals. All groups of subjects demonstrated facilitation of lexical decision latencies due to the combined influence of both orthography and phonology, confirming earlier findings concerning rime relations. The findings are briefly discussed in relation to the neural representation of formal lexical codes.

Adaptive to changes in link costs and network topology, the proposed approach relies on the utilization of an energy function which simulates the objective function used in network optimization while respecting the constraints imposed by the network designers. This function must converge toward a solution which, if not the best is at least as close as possible to the optimum. The simulation results reveal that the end-to-end delay computed according to this neural network approach is usually better than those determined by the conventional routing heuristics, in the sense that our routing algorithm realizes a better trade-off between end-to-end delay and running time, and consequently gives a better performance than many other well-known optimal algorithms.

They are bifunctional cues that act as an attractant for some cell types and as a repellent for others. Several lines of evidence suggest that two classes of receptors, the deleted in colorectal cancer (DCC) family and the UNC-5 family, mediate the attractant and repellent response to netrin. Although netrins were first identified as diffusible long-range cues for developing axons, recent findings provide evidence that they also function as short-range cues close to the surface of the cells that produce them. This short-range function of netrin contributes to guiding neurite outgrowth and mediating cell-cell interactions during development and perhaps also in adults.

The relationship between these data and outcome measures (defined as "basic" independence, "complex" independence, employment status) was investigated. In TBI patients, employment was best predicted by drive, processing speed, and attention, "basic" independence by processing speed and drive, and "complex" independence by drive alone. Brain stem lesions also proved to be strongly related to independence measures and employment status. For stroke patients, no variable predicted employment. Motor function was weakly related to "basic" independence measures, and the ability to establish contact strongly predicted "complex" independence measure. (C) 2000 Academic Press.

Results showed a significant interaction between results of cerebral imagery and GCS on the severity of neuropsychological deficits. For the moderate to severe TBI patients only, the presence of a visible traumatic abnormality on the scan is associated with more important neuropsychological difficulties. Furthermore, the correlation between neuropsychological deficits and short-term global outcome is highly significant. These results provide clinicians with information that will help them intervene more rapidly and appropriately with TBI patients and plan rehabilitation in a more efficient way, (C) 2000 Academic Press.

The government of Quebec has elaborated a rehabilitation model for the head-injured population. Unfortunately, the state of this population after discharge from acute care settings is not known, nor what they have become after their reintegration in society. A feasibility project was developed with three objectives: (1) to determine the percentage of persons and their relatives who could be traced and who would accept to be interviewed; (2) to identify the instruments that would best describe their biopsychosocial state; and (3) to evaluate the Quality of Life of the participant in the community and compare it with the perception of a respondent.

Task-shift costs are assumed to index a process by which subjects reconfigure their task-set when they must perform different tasks across consecutive trials. In neurologically intact teenagers, increased CTI causes reduced task-shift costs since subjects have more time to reconfigure their task-set prior to target onset. Some closed head injury adolescents however, show no reduction of task-shift costs with increased CTI. This indicates that subjects are incapable of reconfiguring their task-set from the cue alone, they also require the target before they are able to initiate this reconfiguration.

Using multiple regressions on 17 avian taxa, we show that an operational estimate of behavioral flexibility, the frequency of feeding innovation reports in ornithology journals, is most closely predicted by relative size of one of these DVR areas, the hyperstriatum ventrale. Neither phytogeny, juvenile development mode, nor species sampled account for the relationship. Similar results are found when the hyperstriatum ventrale is lumped with a second DVR structure, the neostriatum. In simple correlations, size of the wulst and the striatopallidal complex is associated with feeding innovation rate, but the two structures are eliminated from the multiple regressions. Our results parallel those on primates showing a correlation between innovation rate and neocortex size and support the idea that the mammalian neocortex and the neostriatum-hyperstriatum ventrale complex in birds have similar integrative roles.

In the developing nervous system, they do so by regulating naturally-occurring cell death in neural progenitor cells and in postmitotic neurons, acting to ensure the apoptosis of cells that either do not appropriately undergo the progenitor to postmitotic neuron transition, or that fail to compete for sufficient quantities of trophic support. Somewhat surprisingly, in developing postmitotic neurons, p53 plays a proapoptotic role, while a naturally-occurring, truncated form of p73, Delta Np73, antagonizes p53 and plays an anti-apoptotic role. In the mature nervous system, numerous studies indicate that p53 is essential for the neuronal death in response to a variety of insults, including DNA damage, ischemia and excitotoxicity. It is likely that all of these insults culminate in DNA damage, which may well be a common trigger for neuronal apoptosis, In this regard, the signaling pathways that are responsible for triggering p53 dependent neuronal apoptosis are starting to be elucidated, and involve cell cycle deregulation and activation of the JNK pathway, Finally, accumulating evidence indicates that p53 is perturbed in the CNS in a number of neurodegenerative disorders, leading to the hypothesis that longterm oxidative damage and/or excitotoxicity ultimately trigger p53 dependent apoptosis in the chronically degenerating nervous system.

J	Massicotte, G				Massicotte, G			Modification of glutamate receptors by phospholipase A2: its role in adaptive neural plasticity	CELLULAR AND MOLECULAR LIFE SCIENCES			English	Review						glutamate; receptors; phospholipases; LTP; LTD	LONG-TERM POTENTIATION; DEPENDENT PROTEIN-KINASE; RAT VISUAL-CORTEX; H-3 AMPA BINDING; ARACHIDONIC-ACID; HIPPOCAMPAL SLICES; SYNAPTIC TRANSMISSION; QUISQUALATE RECEPTORS; SILENT SYNAPSES; DENTATE GYRUS	Long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) are two electrophysiological models that have been studied extensively in recent years as they may represent basic mechanisms in many neuronal networks to store certain types of information. In several brain regions, it has been shown that these two forms of synaptic plasticity require sufficient dendritic depolarization, with the amplitude of the calcium signal being crucial for the generation of either LTP or LTD. The rise in calcium concentration mediated by the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) subtype of glutamate receptors has been proposed to stimulate various calcium-dependent enzymatic processes that could convert the induction signal into long-lasting changes in synaptic structure; protein kinases and phosphatases have so far been considered predominantly with regard to LTP and LTD formation. According to several lines of experimental evidence, changes in synaptic function observed with LTP and LTD are thought to be the result of modifications of postsynaptic currents mediated by the alpha -amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate (AMPA) subtype of glutamate receptors. Moreover, it has become apparent recently that activation of the calcium-dependent enzyme phospholipase A2 (PLA2) could be part of the molecular mechanisms involved in alterations of AMPA receptor properties during long-term changes in synaptic operation. In the present review, we will first describe the results that indicate a critical role of the phospholipases in regulating synaptic function. Next, sections will be devoted to the effects of PLA2 and phospholipids on the binding properties of glutamate receptors, and a revised biochemical model will be presented as an attempt to integrate the PLA2 enzyme into the mechanisms (in particular kinases and phosphatases) that participate in adaptive neural plasticity. Finally, we will review data relevant to the issue of selective changes in AMPA binding after environmental enrichment and LTP.

In an effort to enhance the potency of DALDA, analogues containing 2',6'-dimethyltyrosine (Dmt), N,2',6'-trimethyltyrosine (Tmt), 2'-methyltyrosine (Mmt) or 2'-hydroxy,6'-methyltyrosine (Hmt) in place of Tyr(1), or Om or alpha,gamma -diaminobutyric acid (A(2)bu) in place of Lys(4), were synthesized. All compounds displayed high mu receptor selectivity in the rat and guinea pig brain membrane binding assays and most of them were more potent mu agonists than DALDA in the mu receptor-representative guinea pig ileum assay, with [Dmt(1)]DALDA showing the highest potency. Because of its extraordinary mu agonist potency, high mu selectivity, polar character (charge of 3+) and metabolic stability, [Dmt(1)]DALDA has potential for use in obstetrical or peripheral analgesia.

J	Bacon, BA; Lepore, F; Guillemot, JP				Bacon, BA; Lepore, F; Guillemot, JP			Neurons in the posteromedial lateral suprasylvian area of the cat are sensitive to binocular positional depth cues	EXPERIMENTAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Review						spatial disparity; binocular interactions; ocular dominance; extrastriate cortex; vision	RECEPTIVE-FIELD PROPERTIES; RANDOM DOT STEREOGRAMS; SINGLE-CELL PROPERTIES; MONKEY STRIATE CORTEX; CLARE-BISHOP NEURONS; SPLIT-CHIASM CATS; VISUAL-CORTEX; OCULAR DOMINANCE; CORTICAL AREA; LENS ACCOMMODATION	Single units in the posteromedial lateral suprasylvian area of the cat are known to be very sensitive to movement. A proportion of these cells can encode movement in depth, but it is unclear whether posteromedial lateral suprasylvian cells only rely upon motion cues to evaluate stimulus depth or whether they can also code for spatial cues. The present study aims at assessing the sensitivity to spatial disparity of binocular cells, in the postero-medial lateral suprasylvian area, in order to determine whether these units are tuned to positional depth cues. A total of 126 single cells located in the posteromedial lateral suprasylvian area of anesthetized, paralyzed cats were examined. As recordings were performed in the central visual field representation, receptive fields were small. A third of the receptive fields were surrounded by an inhibitory region and almost three-quarters of the cells were direction-selective. Most cells (110/114) were binocular, and a large proportion of single neurons responded to stimuli appearing on the fixation plane by increasing (tuned excitatory cells, 43%) or decreasing (tuned inhibitory cells, 14%) their response rate. A smaller proportion of cells increased their firing rate in response to crossed (near cells, 10%) or uncrossed (far cells, 6%) spatial disparities, hence demonstrating respective preference for stimuli presumably appearing in front of or behind the fixation plane. As compared to primary visual cortex, the proportion of disparity-sensitive cells in posteromedial lateral suprasylvian area is similar, but selectivity is significantly coarser. As the posteromedial lateral suprasylvian area can code for both spatial and temporal aspects of stimuli, this area might be involved in the spatiotemporal integration of depth cues, a process that may also participate in the control of accommodation and vergence.

J	Cardin, J; Carbajal, ME; Vitale, ML				Cardin, J; Carbajal, ME; Vitale, ML			Biochemical and morphological diversity among folliculo-stellate cells of the mink (Mustela vison) anterior pituitary	GENERAL AND COMPARATIVE ENDOCRINOLOGY			English	Article						folliculo-stellate cells; S-100; anterior pituitary; mink; cytoskeleton; GFAP; cell culture	S-100 PROTEIN; INTERCELLULAR COMMUNICATION; GROWTH-FACTOR; ADULT-RAT; PROLACTIN; GLAND; ADENOHYPOPHYSIS; TISSUES; HORMONE; TESTOSTERONE	The folliculo-stellate (FS) cells are agranular cells of the anterior pituitary whose origin and function are still a matter of debate. This study examined the presence, topography, and morphological characteristics of FS cells in the mink anterior pituitary throughout the annual reproductive cycle. The S-100 protein was used as a FS cell marker. Immunoperoxidase labeling on tissue sections demonstrated the presence of two types of S-100 positive cells. Type 1 cells were stellate-shaped cells whose nuclei were localized near the center of pituitary follicles. In this type, S-100 labeling was strong in anterior pituitary sections obtained during spring, a period characterized by high prolactin pituitary content and low gonadotropin pituitary content. Type 2 cells were rounded cells occupying the periphery of the follicles. During periods of low prolactin pituitary content and high gonadotropin anterior content the type 2 S-100 positive cells formed aggregates of several cells. The total number of S-100 positive cells was constant during these two periods of the annual reproductive cycle, suggesting that type 1 and type 2 may reflect different morphological and physiological states of the same cell. Of the two subunits, alpha and beta, that, combined, form three different dimeric S-100 proteins, mink FS cells expressed mostly the beta subunit. FS cells also expressed the glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). In culture, 8 +/- 3% of anterior pituitary cells were S-100 positive. Cultured S-100 cells were elongated, polygonal, or rounded. The S-100 labeling accumulated in the cytoplasm around and within the nucleus, whereas it was weak in pseudopods and large cytoplasmic vacuoles. The presence of pseudopods suggests that cultured FS cells could migrate. The vacuoles may be related to the phagocytic activity ascribed to these cells. Some FS cells presented membrane blebbing and peripheral vesicles that were immunopositive for S-100 and that may indicate a secretory activity. Cultured FS cells possessed actin filaments organized as a peripheral network; a few actin cables were also observed running across the cytoplasm. Pseudopods depicted a highly organized actin network. The microtubules of FS cells expanded throughout the cytoplasm. The intermediate filaments expressed by cultured FS cells were GFAP and vimentin. GFAP labeling was punctate and vimentin was organized as filaments. All cultured S-100 cells were positive for vimentin, suggesting a mesenchymal origin for the cells, and all cultured S-100 positive cells were positive for GFAP, suggesting a neuroectodermal origin. In conclusion, S-100 positive cells are heterogeneous with respect to cell shape and expression of S-100 subunits in the mink anterior pituitary. The presence of morphologically different S-100 positive cells is modified in accordance with the endocrine status of the animal, suggesting that FS cells may be involved in the modulation of the anterior pituitary endocrine activity in the mink.

MnSOD is overexpressed in normal aging brain and in various central nervous system disorders; however, the mechanisms mediating the upregulation of MnSOD under these conditions remain poorly understood. We previously reported that cysteamine (CSH) and other pro-oxidants rapidly induce the heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) gene in cultured rat astroglia followed by late upregulation of MnSOD in these cells. In the present study, we demonstrate that antecedent upregulation of HO-1 is necessary and sufficient for subsequent induction of the MnSOD gene in neonatal rat astroglia challenged with CSH or dopamine, and in astroglial cultures transiently transfected with full-length human HO-1 cDNA. Treatment with potent antioxidants attenuates MnSOD expression in HO-1-transfected astroglia, strongly suggesting that intracellular oxidative stress signals MnSOD gene induction in these cells. Activation of this HO-1-MnSOD axis may play an important role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease and other free radical-related neurodegenerative disorders. In these conditions, compensatory upregulation of MnSOD may protect mitochondria from oxidative damage accruing from heme-derived free iron and carbon monoxide liberated by the activity of HO-1.

Here, we used an established model of perinatal asphyxia that induces morphological changes, i.e. neuron loss in the cerebral cortex and striatum, as well as behavioural deficits. We hypothesized that perinatal asphyxia may lead to a neurodegenerative process resulting in cognitive impairment and altered presynaptic bouton numbers in adult rats. We studied cognitive performance at 18 months and presynaptic bouton numbers at 22 months following perinatal asphyxia. Data of the spatial Morris water escape task did not reveal clear memory or learning deficits in aged asphyctic rats compared to aged control rats. However, a memory impairment in aged rats versus young rats was observed, which was more pronounced in asphyctic rats. We found an increase in presynaptic bouton density in the parietal cortex, whereas no changes were found in striatum and frontal cortex in asphyctic rats. An increase of striatal volume was observed in asphyctic rats; leading to an increase in presynaptic bouton numbers in this area. These findings stress the issue that volume measurements have to be taken into account when determining presynaptic bouton density. Furthermore, perinatal asphyxia led to region-specific changes in presynaptic bouton numbers and it worsened the age-related cognitive impairment. These results suggest that perinatal asphyxia induced neuronal loss, which is compensated for by an increase in presynaptic bouton numbers. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Evoked potentials have proven prognostic value of neurologic outcomes in early childhood; however, their long-term predictive validity remains to be determined. The objective of this prospective study was to determine the long-term predictive value of three neonatal neurologic assessments: brainstem auditory evoked potentials, somatosensory evoked potentials, and the Einstein Neonatal Neurobehavioral Assessment Scale. Seventy-eight high-risk newborns and 28 healthy controls were recruited and were assessed in the newborn period using these tests. At 8 to 9 years of age, 42 subjects and 13 controls were re-evaluated for developmental progress using a range of psychologic, sensorimotor; and neurologic measures. Findings indicated that the somatosensory evoked potential was most accurate at predicting outcome at school age, with high specificity (83-100%) across all domains tested and good sensitivity (80-100%) for intellectual performance and sensorimotor abilities. The brainstem auditory evoked potential was limited by false-negatives, whereas the neonatal neurobehavioral assessment yielded many false-positives. This study provides new evidence that associations between neonatal somatosensory evoked potentials and developmental sequelae continue to be significant at school age.

We focus in this article on eligibility criteria as a test case for the reporting of clinical trial methods. We examined the reporting of eligibility criteria in the protocol, methods paper (if applicable), journal article, and Clinical Alert for articles appearing in print between January 1988 and September 1994 for which a Clinical Alert had been issued. Eligibility criteria were further classified into five categories in order to examine the content of information loss, if any. On average, 82% of protocol eligibility criteria were reported in methods papers. Journal articles and Clinical Alerts fared somewhat worse: 63% of criteria were reported in journal articles, 19% in Clinical Alerts. In all three categories of medical communication, the reporting of criteria that defined the study disease tended to be complete; reporting of criteria relating to trial precision, patient safety, legal and ethical concerns, and administrative considerations, was not complete. We found that criteria for clinical trial eligibility are frequently under-reported in medical communications. Moreover, some of the criteria omitted are of considerable clinical importance. We suggest that in the design phase of clinical trials, proposed eligibility criteria be scrutinized closely. Those criteria that survive this scrutiny and that have clinical import must be reported upon fully and accurately when communicating trial results. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Inc.

J	Boue-Grabot, E; Akimenko, MA; Seguela, P				Boue-Grabot, E; Akimenko, MA; Seguela, P			Unique functional properties of a sensory neuronal P2X ATP-gated channel from zebrafish	JOURNAL OF NEUROCHEMISTRY			English	Article						purinoceptor; nucleotide; desensitization; suramin; sensory neurons; Rohon-Beard cells; Xenopus oocytes	ION-CHANNEL; EXTRACELLULAR ATP; NERVOUS-SYSTEM; P-2X RECEPTOR; EXPRESSION; SUBUNITS; IDENTIFICATION; PURINOCEPTOR; FAMILY; GENE	We report here the structural and functional characterization of an ionotropic P2X ATP receptor from the lower vertebrate zebrafish (Danio rerio). The full-length cDNA encodes a 410-amino acid-long channel subunit zP2X(3), which shares only 54% identity with closest mammalian P2X subunits, When expressed in Xenopus oocytes in homomeric form, ATP-gated zP2X(3) channels evoked a unique nonselective cationic current with faster rise time, faster kinetics of desensitization, and slower recovery than any other known P2X channel. Interestingly, the order of agonist potency for this P2X receptor was found similar to that of distantly related P2X, receptors, with benzoylbenzoyl ATP (EC(50) = 5 mu M) much greater than ATP (EC(50) = 350 mu M) = ADP > alpha,beta-methylene ATP (EC(50) = 480 mu M). zP2X(3) receptors are highly sensitive to blockade by the antagonist trinitrophenyl ATP (IC(50) < 5 nM) but are weakly sensitive to the noncompetitive antagonist pyridoxal phosphate-6-azophenyl-2',4'-disulfonic acid. zP2X(3) subunit mRNA is exclusively expressed at high levels in trigeminal neurons and Rohon-Beard cells during embryonic development, suggesting that neuronal P2X receptors mediating fast ATP responses were selected early in the vertebrate phylogeny to play an important role in sensory pathways.

In the present study, we have used combined biochemical and morphological approaches to study the ability of a number of GFs normally expressed during brain development, including basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), epidermal growth factor (EGF), insulin and insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) to induce survival, differentiation, proliferation, and phenotypic expression of immortalized (GT(1-1)) LHRH neurones in vitro, at early (3-days in vitro, 3-DIV) and late (8-DIV) stages of neuronal differentiation. Comparison of GF-treated vs untreated neurones grown in serum-deprived (SD) medium demonstrated bFGF to be the most potent, and insulin the least active in promoting neuronal differentiation. Thus, at both 3-DIV and 8-DIV, but especially at 8-DIV, bFGF induced the greatest increase in the total length and number of LHRH processes/cell and in growth cone surface area. bFGF was also the most active at 3-DIV, and IGF-I at 8-DIV, in counteracting SD-induced cell death, whereas EGF was the most potent in increasing [H-3]thymidine incorporation. All GFs studied decreased the spontaneous release of LHRH from GT(1-1) cells when applied at 3-DIV or 8-DIV, except for insulin which was inactive at both time-points and bFGF which was inactive at 8-DIV. Pre-treatment of GT(1-1) cells with a suboptimal ('priming') dose of bFGF for 12 h followed by application of the different GFs induced a sharp potentiation of the neurotrophic and proliferative effects of the latter and particularly of those of IGF-I. Moreover, bFGF priming counteracted EGF-induced decrease in LHRH release and significantly stimulated LHRH secretion following IGF-I or insulin application, suggesting that bFGF may sensitize LHRH neurones to differentiating effects of specific GFs during development.

We sought to determine whether kinin B-1 receptor can be expressed on human brain endothelial cells (HBECs) in vitro and whether signaling via this receptor can regulate permeability and chemokine production properties of these cells. Multiplex RT-PCR amplification and western blot techniques were used to evaluate B-1 receptor expression by HBECs. Although B-1 receptor mRNA and protein could not be detected on resting HBECs, interferon-gamma induced a dose- and time-dependent up-regulation of B-1 receptor mRNA and protein on HBECs. Stimulation of interferon-gamma-treated HBECs with the selective B-1 agonist R-838 (Sar [D-Phe(8)] des Arg(9)-BK) induced a dose- and time-dependent increase in the production of inositol 3,4,5 tri-phosphate and nitric oxide. Permeability of the HBECs monolayer, as measured by BSA diffusion, was significantly increased by application of the B-1 agonist. This biological effect of R-838 could be prevented by R-715, a B-1 receptor antagonist and by L-NAME, a nitric oxide synthase blocker. R-838 also inhibited interleukin-8 release from HBECs. We demonstrate that B-1 receptors can be up regulated on the surface of KBECs by molecules released during inflammatory response and that signaling via this receptor can regulate BBB permeability and chemokine production in vitro.

J	Ali, DW; Drapeau, P; Legendre, P				Ali, DW; Drapeau, P; Legendre, P			Development of spontaneous glycinergic currents in the Mauthner neuron of the zebrafish embryo	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article							CENTRAL INHIBITORY SYNAPSE; RECEPTOR-ALPHA SUBUNIT; TIME-COURSE; SYMPATHETIC NEURONS; VOLTAGE-DEPENDENCE; CHANNEL KINETICS; CELL; RELEASE; TRANSMISSION; ACTIVATION	We used whole cell and outside-out patch-clamp techniques with reticulospinal Mauthner neurons of zebrafish embryos to investigate the developmental changes in the properties of glycinergic synaptic currents in vivo from the onset of synaptogenesis. Miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIP-SCs) were isolated and recorded in the presence of TTX (1 mu M), kynurenic acid (1 mM), and bicuculline (10 mu M) and were found to be sensitive to strychnine (1 mM). The mIPSCs were first observed in 26-29 h postfertilization (hpf) embryos at a very low frequency of similar to 0.04 Hz, which increased to similar to 0.5 Hz by 30-40 hpf, and was similar to 10 Hz in newly hatched (>50 hpf) larvae, indicating an accelerated increase in synaptic activity. At all embryonic stages, the amplitudes of the mIPSCs were variable but their means were similar (similar to 100 pA), suggesting rapid formation of the postsynaptic matrix. The 20-80% rise times of mIPSCs in embryos were longer (0.6-1.2 ms) than in larvae (similar to 0.3 ms), likely due to slower diffusion of glycine at the younger, immature synapses. The mIPSCs decayed with biexponential (tau(off1) and tau(off2)) time courses with a half-width in 26-29 hpf embryos that was longer and more variable than in older embryos and larvae. In 26- to 29-hpf embryos, tau(off1) was similar to 15 ms and tau(off2) was similar to 60 ms, representing events of intermediate duration; but occasionally long mIPSCs were observed in some cells where tau(off1) was similar to 40 ms and tau(off2) was similar to 160 ms. In 30-40 hpf embryos, the events were faster, with tau(off1) similar to 9 ms and tau(off2) similar to 40 ms, and in larvae, events declined somewhat further to tau(off1) similar to 4 ms and tau(off2) similar to 30 ms. Point-per-point amplitude histograms of the decay of synaptic events at all stages resulted in the detection of similar single channel conductances estimated as similar to 45 pS, indicating the presence of heteromeric glycine receptors (GlyRs) from the onset of synaptogenesis. Fast-flow (1 ms) application of a saturating concentration of glycine (3-10 mM) to outside-out patches obtained at 26-29 hpf revealed GlyR currents that decayed biexponentially with time constants resembling the values found for intermediate and long mIPSCs; by 30-40 hpf, the GlyR currents resembled fast mIPSCs. These observations indicate that channel kinetics limited the mIPSC duration. Our data suggest that glycinergic mIPSCs result from the activation of a mixture of fast and slow GlyR subtypes, the properties and proportion of which determine the decay of the synaptic events in the embryos.

J	Petrides, M				Petrides, M			Dissociable roles of mid-dorsolateral prefrontal and anterior inferotemporal cortex in visual working memory	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						dorsolateral prefrontal cortex; inferotemporal cortex; visual working memory; monkey; lesions; monitoring; control process	LATERAL FRONTAL-CORTEX; RHESUS-MONKEY; AFFERENT INPUT; CONNECTIONS; PRIMATE; SUBDIVISIONS; ORGANIZATION; ASSOCIATION; PROJECTIONS; LESIONS	Functional neuroimaging in human subjects and studies of monkeys with lesions limited to the mid-dorsolateral (MDL) prefrontal cortex have shown that this specific region of the prefrontal cortex is involved in visual working memory, although its precise role remains a matter of debate. The present study compared the effect on visual working memory of lesions restricted to the mid-dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of the monkey with that of lesions to the anterior inferotemporal cortex, a region of the temporal cortex specialized for visual memory. Increasing the delay during which information had to be maintained in visual working memory impaired performance after lesions of the anterior inferotemporal cortex, but not after mid-dorsolateral prefrontal lesions. By contrast, increasing the number of stimuli that had to be monitored impaired the performance of animals with mid-dorsolateral prefrontal lesions, but not that of animals with anterior inferotemporal lesions. This demonstration of a double dissociation between the effects of these two lesions provides strong evidence that the role of the mid-dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in visual working memory does not lie in the maintenance of information per se, but rather in the executive process of monitoring this information. In addition, the present study demonstrated that lesions limited to area 9, which constitutes the superior part of the mid-dorsolateral prefrontal region, give rise to a mild impairment in the monitoring of information, whereas lesions of the complete mid-dorsolateral prefrontal region yield a very severe impairment.

In this report, we present a novel technique, which selectively targets oligodendrocytes within the spinal cord of transgenic mice to produce focal demyelination. Transgenic mice expressing the E. coli LacZ (beta-galactosidase) gene from the myelin basic protein promotor allowed for oligodendrocyte-specific cleavage of topically applied fluorescein-di-beta-galactopyranoside liberating photoactivatable fluorescein. Subsequent fluorescence illumination generated oxygen radicals that oxidized a second exogenous substrate, 3-amino-9-ethylcarbazote, to form a toxic precipitate within oligodendrocytes. Histochemical staining of the spinal cord dorsal columns 8 days following phototargeting revealed that the treated region no longer contained beta-galactosidasepositive cells. Focal demyelination of the dorsal columns was observed to a depth of 150 mu m in transverse semithin plastic sections. Numerous bundles of naked axons interspersed with myelin, debris-laden macrophages, and reactive astrocytes were evident by electron microscopy. Remyelination of axons by both oligodendrocytes and invading Schwann cells was observed within the treated region 14 days after phototargeting. Newly generated oligodendrocytes were identified within the demyelinated region by their incorporation of bromodeoxyuridine. Thus, this novel focal demyelination protocol provides: (1) a method for selective targeted ablation of oligodendrocytes in vivo, (2) control over the extent of the demyelinated region, with (3) an environment that maintains its remyelination capacity. Phototargeted ablation of oligodendrocytes may therefore be a useful model for studying axon-glia interactions, axon regeneration within a demyelinated zone, and remyelination of axons.

J	Samaha, M; Katsarkas, A				Samaha, M; Katsarkas, A			Vestibular impairment in peripheral sensory neuropathies	JOURNAL OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY			English	Article						peripheral sensory neuropathy; vestibular dysfunction		Objective: Patients with peripheral sensory neuropathies frequently complain of dizziness, mainly unsteadiness, which occasionally seems to be more severe than the neuropathy. This study is an attempt to determine whether in cases where dizziness is a prominent feature the underlying cause is, at times, a concomitant vestibular dysfunction. Method: The files of 50 patients suffering from peripheral sensory neuropathies were retrospectively reviewed. Patients with central nervous system disease capable of inducing vestibular dysfunction were excluded from this study. In 47 of 50 patients, bithermal caloric tests were performed as part of electronystagmographic recordings. According to the caloric responses, these patients were divided into three groups: group 1: bilaterally reduced responses, group 2: unilaterally reduced responses, and group 3: normal symmetric responses. Results: In 17 of 47 patients, the caloric responses were reduced bilaterally (group 1). In 8 of 47 patients, the responses were reduced unilaterally (group 2). In 22 of 47 patients, the caloric responses were normal and symmetric (group 3). Conclusion: Vestibular dysfunction was encountered in 25 of 47 patients (53.2%) suffering from peripheral sensory neuropathy. One wonders whether the pathologic process affecting the peripheral sensory nerves may also affect the vestibular nerve. This seems possible in view of the fact that the vestibular nerve, a sensory nerve itself, has a histologic structure similar to the peripheral sensory nerves.

Serum was extracted with an organic solvent, and the extract chromatographed using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). A total of 50 fractions was collected for each sample and split using a stream splitter so that 30% was collected in counting vials for recovery while 70% was collected in test tubes which were assayed by radioimmunoassay. An antiserum raised in our laboratory to progesterone-3-CMO-BSA cross-reacted with five of these compounds (5 alpha- and 5 beta -dihydroprogesterone, 3 alpha- and 3 beta -5 alpha -tetrahydroprogesterone, and 3 beta ,5 beta -tetrahydroprogesterone). Since pregnenolone eluted with 5 alpha ,3 beta -tetrahydroprogesterone, pregnenolone was assayed separately and its effect subtracted. Using this method it was shown that picogram to nanogram/ml amounts of these metabolites are present in all human sera. Levels in men were comparable to those of women in the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle. 5 alpha -Dihydroprogesterone and 3 alpha ,5 alpha -tetrahydroprogesterone rose substantially in the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle and all lose considerably during pregnancy.

J	Hudon, G; Guy, C; Hermia, J				Hudon, G; Guy, C; Hermia, J			Measurement of odor intensity by an electronic nose	JOURNAL OF THE AIR & WASTE MANAGEMENT ASSOCIATION			English	Article							OLFACTOMETRY	The possibility of using electronic noses (ENs) to measure odor intensity was investigated in this study. TWO commercially available ENs, an Aromascan A32S with conducting polymer sensors and an Alpha M.O.S. Fox 3000 with metal oxide sensors, as well as an experimental EN made of Taguchi-type tin oxide sensors, were used in the experiments. Odor intensity measurement by sensory analysis and EN sensor response were obtained for samples of odorous compounds (n-butanol, CH3COCH3, and C2H5SH) and for binary mixtures of odorous compounds (n-butanol and CH3COCH3). Linear regression analysis and artificial neural networks (ANN) were used to establish a relationship between odor intensity and EN sensor responses. The results suggest that large differences in sensor response to samples of equivalent odor intensity exist and that sensitivity to odorous compounds varies according to the type of sensors. A linear relationship between odor intensify and averaged sensor response was found to be appropriate for the EN based on conducting polymer sensors with a correlation coefficient (r) of 0.94 between calculated and measured odor intensity. However, the linear regression approach was shown to be inadequate for both ENs, which included metal oxide-type sensors. Very strong correlation (r = 0.99) between measured odor intensity and calculated odor intensity using the ANN developed were obtained for both commercial ENs. A weaker correlation (r = 0.84) was found for the experimental instrument, suggesting an insufficient number of sensors and/or not enough diversity in sensor responses. The results demonstrated the ability of ENs to measure odor intensity associated with simple mixtures of odorous compounds and suggest that ANN are appropriate to model the relationship between odor intensity measurement and EN sensor response.

The myelin basic protein peptide (a.a. 83-99) represents one candidate antigen; therefore, it was chosen to design an altered peptide ligand, CGP77116, for specific immunotherapy of multiple sclerosis. A magnetic resonance imaging-controlled phase II clinical trial with this altered peptide ligand documented that it was poorly tolerated at the dose tested, and the trial had therefore to be halted. Improvement or worsening of clinical or magnetic resonance imaging parameters could not be demonstrated in this small group of individuals because of the short treatment duration. Three patients developed exacerbations of multiple sclerosis, and in two this could be linked to altered peptide ligand treatment by immunological studies demonstrating the encephalitogenic potential of the myelin basic protein peptide (a.a. 83-99) in a subgroup of patients. These data raise important considerations for the use of specific immunotherapies in general.

Different lesions are applied to the model in order to investigate the working memory deficits observed in Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia. The simulations predict that the working memory deficits observed in Parkinson's disease result from a local dysfunction within the brain due to a problem in the disinhibitory process arising from the basal ganglia. They also predict that the working memory deficits observed in schizophrenia involve many cortical and subcortical areas and result from a problem in selecting items in working memory which are stored in basal ganglia-thalamocortical loops. The simulations predict the temporal unfolding of neuronal activity in different brain regions, both in the normal case and in the two disease states. A specific event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging study was elaborated to test some of those predictions. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Proopiomelanocortin (POMC), the common precursor ofadrenocorticotropic hormone and beta -END, is detected very early in embryonic life in hypothalamic neurons of the developing rat. However, very little is known about the degree to which POMC is processed to beta -END during fetal and early postnatal life. Thus, it was the objective of the present study to estimate the hypothalamic content of POMC mRNA, as well as the biosynthesis and posttranslational processing of POMC by hypothalamic neurons on fetal day 20 and on days 1, 8 and 22 of postnatal life. Hypothalamic POMC mRNA, as determined by Northern blot analysis, was higher on fetal day 20 than on postnatal days 1,8 and 22. A higher rate of incorporation of [H-3]phenylalanine into beta -END immunoreactive peptides was observed on fetal day 20 than on postnatal day 1. However, the rate of incorporation was significantly increased by day 8 of postnatal life and was similar to that on day 22. POMC was processed to beta -lipotropin (beta -LPH) and P-END at all ages examined, but the relative proportions of POMC:beta -LPH:beta -END changed during development. Thus, beta -END accounted only for 34.89 +/- 6.14% of the total [H-3]phenylalanine-labeled beta -END immunoreactive peptides on fetal day 20, while it accounted for 57.37 +/- 5.20, 62.81 +/- 1.38 and 79.25 +/- 6.57% on days 1, 8 and 22 of postnatal life, respectively. Thus, POMC is processed to a considerable extent into beta -END-sized peptides by the fetal hypothalamus and may influence brain development. Furthermore, the rate of processing of hypothalamic POMC into beta -END increases with development, probably due to the increased activity of the enzymes specific for POMC processing.

Although initial studies were performed with antibodies that also recognised the other endogenous neurokinins, most of the initial descriptions are surprisingly still valid today. in this review, we provide an integrated overview of the pathways containing SP in the central and peripheral nervous systems. The highest densities of SP immunoreactivity occur in the superficial dorsal horn of the spinal cord, in the substantia nigra and in the medial amygdaloid nucleus. In the peripheral nervous system, SP occurs in high concentrations in small diameter primary sensory fibres and in the enteric nervous system. SP is extensively co-localised with classical transmitters and other neuropeptides. In the spinal cord, SP immunoreactive axonal boutons are preferentially presynaptic to neurons expressing the SP receptor, suggesting that the neurokinin acts at a short distance from the release site. In contrast, in the periphery, the situation probably differs in the autonomic ganglia, where the targets are directly innervated by SP, and in other peripheral territories, where SP has to diffuse through the connective tissue to reach the structures expressing the receptor.

These transient high levels of NGF result in a lasting hyper-innervation of the spinal white matter by ectopic Substance P (SP)-immunoreactive (IR) sensory fibres. Ultrastructural studies in adult transgenic mice demonstrated that the SP-containing fibres establish synapses on neuronal dendrites in the white matter and that most such dendrites express SP receptors. The transgenic animals display a stimulus-induced hyperalgesia and allodynia in a test measuring the latency to tail withdrawal following a heat stimulus. The hyperalgesia and allodynia were reversed by systemic administration of SP receptor or NMDA receptor antagonists. Surprisingly, the application of morphine resulted in an increase in withdrawal latency which was greater than that observed in non-transgenic controls. (C) 2000 Harcourt Publishers Ltd.

Lesions of the medial nuclei impaired rotorod and spatial orientation, while CL lesions impaired only rotorod performance. Neither lesion affected stationary beam and hole-board tests or visuomotor guidance while swimming toward a visible platform. These spatial and sensorimotor deficits cannot be explained by reduced cerebral activation, but instead are attributable to specific projections from the anterior intralaminar nuclei to the basal ganglia and neocortex.

Early changes in neuromotor behaviors associated with neurodegenerative disorders or neurotoxic effects are often subtle and fluctuating in their characteristics. Therefore, their detection at an early stage is particularly difficult without precise recording instruments. The CATSYS system developed by Danish Product Development (DPD) is a portable device recording four measures of neuromotor control including tremor, reaction time, hand coordination and postural sway. The aim of this study is to develop a set of normative data. One hundred and fifty healthy men and women were divided into five age groups: (1) 20 to 29 years (n=30); (2) 30 to 39 years (n=30); (3) 40 to 49 years (n=30); (4) 50 to 59 years (n=30); (5) 60 to 70 years (n=30). All participants were free of neurological deficits at the time elf testing and they were tested individually for approximately 30 min. Hand coordination was measured with prone-supination and finger-tapping movements executed at constant and accelerated rhythms. Reaction time was assessed in both hands using a hand held switch activated by the thumb. Postural tremor Mas quantified in both hands during 24.6 sec. by asking the subject to hold a stylus horizontally at 10 cm in front of his/her navel. The stylus contained a biaxial accelerometer Postural sway Mas tested by asking the subject to stand on a force platform for 75 sec. under four conditions: (II eyes open; (2) eyes closed; 13) eyes open standing on a foam pad; and (4) eyes closed standing on a loam pad. ANOVAs and multiple comparison tests were performed and the results were examined taking into account age, gender and experimental condition effects. (C) 2000 Inter Press, Inc.

Cultured hippocampal cells elaborate dendritic and axonal processes following well-defined steps. We used this culture system to determine the specific effects of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) and neurotrophin-4 (NT-4) on dendritic and axonal differentiation in hippocampal pyramidal neurons. We demonstrated that each of these neurotrophins exert distinct effects on neurite outgrowth. Both BDNF and NT-3 had positive effects on the outgrowth of undifferentiated neurites, called minor neurites, and on the axonal process of hippocampal pyramidal neurons. However, the effect of NT-3 was more important than that of BDNF. On the other hand, NT-4 did not enhance axonal outgrowth but had only an effect on the outgrowth of minor neurites. Since cytoskeletal proteins play crucial roles in promoting neurite outgrowth, we examined the protein levels of some of these proteins that are associated with neurite outgrowth: beta-actin, gamma-actin, alpha-tubulin, MAP2 and tau. Surprisingly, we did not detect any change in their protein levels. Taken together, our results show that BDNF, NT-3 and NT-4 exert distinct effects on the neuritic compartments of hippocampal neurons. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Motor stimulation of the affected hand produced ipsilateral activation in the premotor area in all patients, the SMA in two patients, and SII in two patients. Vibrotactile stimulation resulted in activation of the ipsilateral SII in all subjects. Median nerve stimulation of the affected hand produced ipsilateral long-latency SEPs in fronto-centro-parietal areas, whereas stimulation of the non-affected hand produced normal early cortical potentials in the contralateral hemisphere. Our results suggest that residual function in the paretic hand is warranted through non-primary motor and sensory areas, and higher order associative areas in the intact hemisphere.

Neurons in the auditory cortex of such animals have visual response properties that resemble those of neurons in the primary visual cortex of normal animals. Therefore, we investigated the behavioral function of the surgically induced retino-thalamo-cortical pathways. We showed that both surgically induced pathways can mediate visually guided behaviors whose normal substrate, the pathway from the retina to the primary visual cortex via the primary thalamic visual nucleus, is missing.

The autosomal dominant form of the disease is caused by short (GCG)(8-13) expansions in the PABP2 gene. This gene encodes the poly(A) binding protein 2 (PABP2), an abundant nuclear protein that binds with high affinity to nascent poly(A) tails, stimulating their extension and controlling their length. In this work we report that PABP2 is detected in filamentous nuclear inclusions, which are the pathological hall mark of OPMD. Using both immunoelectron microscopy and fluorescence confocal microscopy, the OPMD-specific nuclear inclusions appeared decorated by anti-PABP2 antibodies. In addition, the inclusions were labeled with antibodies directed against ubiquitin and the subunits of the proteasome and contained a form of PABP2 that was more resistant to salt extraction than the protein dispersed in the nucleoplasm. This suggests that the polyalanine expansions in PABP2 induce a misfolding and aggregation of the protein into insoluble inclusions, similarly to events in neurodegenerative diseases caused by CAG/polyglutamine expansions. No significant differences were observed in the steady-state poly(A) tail length in OPMD and normal myoblasts, However, the nuclear inclusions were shown to sequester poly(A) RNA.

It is flexible and adopts several different types conformations in different NGF crystal forms. We have previously shown that a small cyclic peptide derived from the C-D loop of NGF binds to the TrkA receptor by mimicking the structure of this loop. To understand structure-function relationships in NGF C-D loop mimetics, we have produced a series of peptides predicted to form different types of beta-turns. The peptides were tested for their ability to promote cell survival in serum-free medium and to induce TrkA tyrosine phosphorylation. NMR structural studies were used to determined the backbone conformation and the spatial orientation of side chains involved in binding to the TrkA receptor. Peptides that form type I or type gamma L-alpha R beta-turns were the most active. The variety of active loop conformations suggests that the mimetics (and NGF) accommodate the binding site on TrkA by an 'induced fit' mechanism. In agreement with this hypothesis, NMR relaxation measurements detected both fast and slow motion in the peptides. We also characterized a retro-inverso peptide derived from the NGF C-D loop. This D-amino acid cyclic peptide did not adopt a conformation homologous to the NGF C-D loop and was inactive. This may be representative of difficulties in producing structural and functional mimetics by retro-inverso schemes.

It is indistinguishable from the subacute autonomic neuropathy that may accompany lung cancer or other tumors. Autoantibodies specific for nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the autonomic ganglia are potentially pathogenic and may serve as serologic markers of various forms of autoimmune autonomic neuropathy. Methods: We tested serum from 157 patients with a variety of types of dysautonomia. Immunoprecipitation assays with iodine-125-labeled epibatidine and solubilized human neuroblastoma acetylcholine receptors were used to detect autoantibodies that bound to or blocked ganglionic receptors. Results: Ganglionic-receptor-binding antibodies were found in 19 of 46 patients with idiopathic or paraneoplastic autonomic neuropathy (41 percent), in 6 of 67 patients with postural tachycardia syndrome, idiopathic gastrointestinal dysmotility, or diabetic autonomic neuropathy (9 percent), and in none of 44 patients with other autonomic disorders. High levels of the binding antibodies correlated with more severe autonomic dysfunction (including the presence of tonic pupils). Levels of these antibodies decreased in patients who had clinical improvement. All seven patients with ganglionic-receptor-blocking antibodies had ganglionic-receptor-binding antibodies and had idiopathic or paraneoplastic autonomic neuropathy. Conclusions: Seropositivity for antibodies that bind to or block ganglionic acetylcholine receptors identifies patients with various forms of autoimmune autonomic neuropathy and distinguishes these disorders from other types of dysautonomia. The positive correlation between high levels of ganglionic-receptor antibodies and the severity of autonomic dysfunction suggests that the antibodies have a pathogenic role in these types of neuropathy.

These neoplasias exhibit genetic and clinical heterogeneity, but little is known about their molecular pathogenesis. Application of the differential-display PCR approach led to the identification of a gene, glypican 3 (GPC3), that is differentially expressed in cancer cells. Expression of this gene is usually limited to fetal mesodermal tissue, and its inactivation has been found to be responsible for the X-linked Simpson-Golabi-Behmel overgrowth syndrome. Here, we show that GPC3 mRNA is present in several neuroblastomas and all Wilms' tumors tested to date but not in medulloblastoma, GPC3 was not expressed in normal kidney tissues obtained from the corresponding Wilms' tumor patients, suggesting that in these cancer cells expression was not repressed (or was activated). No correlation was found between expression of GPC3 and the known indicator of neuroblastoma prognosis MYCN mRNA. However, all samples that expressed GPC3 also expressed IGF-II, coding for a growth factor important in the survival and growth of many cancer types. Although the biological significance of this relationship remains unclear, our results suggest that GPC3 may be implicated in the development of embryonal tumors through a signaling pathway that appears to involve IGF-II.

Following hemispherectomy, retinal input to the ipsilateral PGN was reduced by an average of 18.5% when compared to its contralateral homologue, which corresponded to the reduction in nuclear volume (19.3%). Our results show that removal of cortical afferents to the external layer of the PGN does not induce invasion of retinal projections into this region of the nucleus. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Inc.

To investigate the subunit composition of native ASICs in peripheral and central neurons, we coinjected human as well as rodent ASIC2a and ASIC3 subunits in Xenopus oocytes, The amplitudes of acid-induced biphasic responses mediated by co-expressed ASIC2a and ASIC3 subunits were much larger (as much as 20-fold) than the currents mediated by the respective homomers, clearly indicating functional association. The reversal potential of the ASIC2a+3 current (greater than or equal to+20 mV) reflected a cationic current mainly selective for sodium, The sensitivity to pH or amiloride of single versus co-expressed ASIC subunits was not significantly different; however, gadolinium ions inhibited ASICS and ASIC2a+3 responses with much higher potency (IC50 similar to 40 mu M) than the ASIC2a response (IC50 greater than or equal to 1 mM). Biochemical interaction between ASIC2a and ASIC3 subunits was demonstrated by co-purification from transfected human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells and Xenopus oocytes. Our in situ hybridization data showed that rat ASIC2a and ASIC3 transcripts are colocalized centrally, whereas reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction data led us to detect co-expression of human ASIC2a and ASIC3 subunits in trigeminal sensory ganglia, brain, and testis where they might coassemble into a novel subtype of proton-gated channels sensitive to gadolinium.

We previously described an ultrarapid delayed rectifier current in dog atrial myocytes (I-Kur,I-d) with properties resembling currents reported for Kv3.1, channels in neural tissue; however, there was no direct molecular evidence for Shaw subfamily (Kv3) subunit expression in the heart. To identify the molecular basis of I-Kur,I-d, we cloned a full-length cDNA (dKv3.1) from canine atrium with homology-based reverse transcription (RT)polymerase chain reaction (PCR) cloning techniques. 2. A 1755 bp full-length cDNA (dKv3.1) was obtained, with 94.2% homology to rat brain Kv3.1 (rbKv3.1). The deduced amino acid sequence had 99.3% homology with rbKv3.1. 3. Heterologous expression of dKv3.1 in Xenopus oocytes produced currents with activation voltage dependence, rectification, and activation and deactivation kinetics that strongly resemble native I-Kur,I-d. Like I-Kur,I-d, dKv3.1 was found to be highly sensitive to extracellular C-aminopyridine (4-AP) and tetraethylammonium (TEA). 4. RNase protection assays, Western blots and immunohistochemical studies demonstrated the presence of dKv3.1 transcripts and proteins in dog atrial preparations and isolated canine atrial myocytes. Protein corresponding to the Kv1.5 subunit, which can also carry ultrarapid delayed rectifier current, was absent. Unlike neural tissues, which express two splice variants (Kv3.1a and Kv3.1b), canine atrium showed only Kv3.1b transcripts. 5. Whole-cell patch-clamp studies showed that I-Kur,I-d is absent in canine ventricular myocytes, and immunohistochemical and Western blot analysis demonstrated the absence of dKv3.1 protein in canine ventricle. 6. We conclude that the Shaw-type channel dKv3.1 is present in dog atrium, but not ventricle, and is the likely molecular basis of canine atrial I-Kur,I-d.

Design: N/A Setting: N/A Patients: A polysomnographic study was performed on 15 adult sleepwalkers and 15 age- and sex-matched controls. Interventions: N/A Measurements & Results: Sleepwalkers had a significantly greater number of awakenings from SWS than did control subjects. Controls showed a greater decrease in SWA across NREM cycles. Sleepwalkers had a significantly lower level of SWA during the first NREM period, where most awakenings take place. Conclusion: Sleepwalkers appear to suffer from an abnormality in the neural mechanisms responsible for the regulation of SWS.

To gain insight into this phenomenon, we investigated the identity and distribution of NT1 receptor proteins in the brain of 10-day-old rats by using two different NT1 antibodies: one (Abi3) directed against the third intracellular loop and the other (Abi4) against the C-terminus of the receptor. Immunoblot experiments that used Abi3 revealed the presence of two differentially glycosylated forms of the NT1 receptor in developing rat brain: one migrating at 54 and the other at 52 kDa. Whereas the 54-kDa form was expressed from birth to adulthood, the 52-kDa form was detected only at 10 and 15 days postnatal. Only the 52-kDa isoform was recognized by Abi4. By immunohistochemistry, both forms of the receptor were found to be predominantly expressed in cerebral cortex and dorsal hippocampus, in keeping with earlier radioligand binding and in situ hybridization data. However, whereas Abi4 immunoreactivity was mainly concentrated within nerve cell bodies and extensively colocalized with the Golgi marker a-mannosidase II, Abi3 immunoreactivity was predominantly located along neuronal processes. These results suggest that the transitorily expressed 52-kDa protein corresponds to an immature, incompletely glycosylated and largely intracellular form of the NT1 receptor and that the 54-kDa protein corresponds to a mature, fully glycosylated, and largely membrane-associated form. They also indicate that antibodies directed against different sequences of G-protein-coupled receptors may yield isoform-specific immunohistochemical labeling patterns in mammalian brain. Finally, the selective expression of the short form of the NT1 receptor early in development suggests that it may play a specific role in the establishment of neuronal circuitry. J. Comp.

In particular, spectral changes such as the formant transitions of speech, or spectral motion (SM) by analogy with visual motion, could be processed in specialized cortical regions. In this study, positron emission tomography (PEI) was used to identify which auditory cortical region are involved in SM analysis. We found that a bilateral secondary auditory cortical region, located in the caudal-lateral belt of auditory cortex, was more sensitive to auditory stimuli containing spectral changes than to matched stimuli with a stationary spectral profile. This result suggests that analogies between sensory systems could prove useful in the research into the functional organization of the auditory cortex.

In this study, performance of clinically stable spf and control mice (8-10-weeks-old) on two learning tests was assessed under normal Arg(+) or arginine-free Arg(-) diet conditions. Used as an indicator of the metabolic status of the animals, plasma ammonia concentrations were significantly higher in spf than in controls on normal diet, and increased even more during the Arg(-) diet episode. Behaviourally, we found no difference in passive avoidance learning between control and spf mice on Arg(+) diet, whereas in spf mice receiving Arg(-) diet during training, retention performance was significantly reduced. In the hidden-platform water maze, spf mice on Arg(+) diet only showed decreased swimming velocity compared to controls. In mice on Arg(-) diet during the first week of acquisition training, performance on acquisition and retention (probe) trials showed that spf mice experienced more difficulties in actually locating the platform. Visible-platform control experiments only showed a reduction in swimming velocity in spf mice on either diet. We conclude that cognitive performance is impaired in spf mice as a consequence of Arg(-) diet-induced neurochemical alterations. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Fatigati, MD; Anderson, RM; Rompre, PP				Fatigati, MD; Anderson, RM; Rompre, PP			Effects of prefrontal cortex microinjection of neurotensin-(8-13) on midbrain dopamine and non-dopamine cell firing	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						dopamine; neurotensin; prefrontal cortex; ventral midbrain	VENTRAL TEGMENTAL AREA; RAT; NEURONS; RECEPTORS; TERMINALS	Effects of prefrontal cortex microinjections of 0.3 and 3 nmol/0.5 mu l of neurotensin-(8-13) on the firing rate of midbrain dopamine and non-dopamine cells were studied in urethane-anesthetized rats. Neurotensin produced an increase in firing in 14 of 26 dopamine cells tested, an effect that peaked between 15 and 20 min after the injection at both doses. On the Ether hand, a majority of non-dopamine cells (7/10) tested with the higher dose of neurotensin showed a statistically significant decrease in firing when compared to saline, an effect that also peaked between 15 and 20 min. These results show that prefrontal cortex neurotensin can modulate both dopamine and non-dopamine neurotransmission in the ventral midbrain. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science BN. All rights reserved.

This study aimed at establishing ionic mechanisms underlying potential electrophysiological effects of nicotine. Methods and Results-Effects of nicotine on Kv4.3 and Kv4.2 channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes were studied at the whole-cell and single-channel levels. The effects of nicotine on the transient outward K+ current (I-to) were studied by use of whole-cell patch-clamp techniques in canine Ventricular myocytes. Nicotine potently inhibited Kv4 current, The concentration for half-maximal inhibition (ICS,) was 40+/-4 nmoI/L, and the current was abolished by 100 mu mol/L nicotine. The ICS, for block of native I-to was 270+/-43 nmol/L. The steady-state activation properties of Kv4.3 and I-to were unaltered by nicotine, whereas positive shifts of the inactivation curves were observed. Of the total inhibition of Kv4,3 and I-to by nicotine, 40% was due to tonic block and 60% was attributable to use-dependent block. Activation, inactivation, and reactivation kinetics were not significantly changed by nicotine. Nicotine reduced single-channel conductance, open probability, and open time but increased the closed time of Kv4.3. The effects of nicotine were not altered by antagonists to various neurotransmitter receptors, indicating direct effects on I-to channels. Conclusions -Nicotine is a potent inhibitor of cardiac A- type K+ channels, with blockade probably due to block of closed and open channels. This action may contribute to the ability of nicotine to affect cardiac electrophysiology and induce arrhythmias.

The extra chromosome derives from the mother in 93% of cases and is due to abnormal chromosome segregation during meiosis (nondisjunction). Except for advanced age at conception, maternal risk factors for meiotic nondisjunction are not well established. A recent preliminary study suggested that abnormal folate metabolism and the 677C-->T polymorphism in the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene may be maternal risk factors for Down syndrome. The present study was undertaken with a larger sample size to determine whether the MTHFR 677C-->T polymorphism was associated with increased risk of having a child with Down syndrome. Methionine synthase reductase (MTRR) is another enzyme essential for normal folate metabolism. A common polymorphism in this gene was recently associated with increased risk of neural tube defects and might also contribute to increased risk for Down syndrome. The frequencies of the MTHFR 677C-->T and MTRR 66A-->G mutations were evaluated in DNA samples from 157 mothers of children with Down syndrome and 144 control mothers. Odds ratios were calculated for each genotype separately and for potential gene-gene interactions. The results are consistent with the preliminary observation that the MTHFR 677C-->T polymorphism is more prevalent among mothers of children with Down syndrome than among control mothers, with an odds ratio of 1.91 (95% confidence interval [CT] 1.19-3.05). In addition, the homozygous MTRR 66A-->G polymorphism was independently associated with a 2.57-fold increase in estimated risk (95% CI 1.33-4.99). The combined presence of both polymorphisms was associated with a greater risk of Down syndrome than was the presence of either alone, with an odds ratio of 4.08 (95% CI 1.94-8.56). The two polymorphisms appear to act without a multiplicative interaction.

Design: Using a quasi-experimental design, 64 children with head injury admitted to the center and who received rehabilitation services in either 1995 or 1993 were evaluated by using the Functional Independence Measure for children (WeeFIM(TM))/The Functional Independence Measure (FIM(TM)) (e.g., primary outcome measure). Secondary outcomes included "psychosocial adjustment," "return to regular school," and "current problems related to the head injury. Results: No statistically significant differences were found between the groups with respect to mean WeeFIM/FIM scores after controlling for age and injury severity. The 1993 group had poorer scores on the withdrawal subscale of the psychosocial measure (P = 0.02), yet a smaller proportion of these children were enrolled in a special education class (P = 0.02). Conclusions: This study serves as a model for a larger, definitive study of the effectiveness of rehabilitation for children with head injury. The trends suggest that more comprehensive care may lead to better outcomes.

In this study, we evaluated the influence of hypobaric hypoxia on the expression of NOS isoforms, argininosuccinate synthetase (AS), argininosuccinate lyase (AL), and manganese superoxide dismutase (Mn SOD) in the ventilatory muscles. Rats were exposed to hypobaric hypoxia (similar to 95 mmHg) from birth for 60 days or 9-11 mo. Age-matched control groups of rats also were examined. Sixty days of hypoxia elicited approximately two-and ninefold increases in diaphragmatic eNOS and nNOS protein expression (evaluated by immunoblotting), respectively, and about a 50% rise in diaphragmatic NOS activity. In contrast, NOS activity and the expression of these proteins declined significantly in response to 9 mo of hypoxia. Hypoxia elicited no significant alterations in AS, AL and Mn SOD protein expression. Moreover, the inducible NOS (iNOS) was not detected in normoxic and hypoxic diaphragmatic samples. We conclude that diaphragmatic NOS expression and activity undergo significant adaptations to hypobaric hypoxia and that iNOS does not participate in this response.

There is considerable evidence of interaction between the neurogenic and the immune systems, and NKs are candidates for mediating such interactions. We hypothesized that selective inhibition of pulmonary NK-1 or NK-2 receptors may modulate immune responses so as to prevent the development of allergic airway responses in the atopic BN rat sensitized to ovalbumin (OA). To address this hypothesis, we have validated our animal model by showing that NK-1 and NK-2 receptors are expressed in the lungs, and that SP is released in the airways after allergen challenge. The selective NK-1 (CP-99,994) or NK-2 (SR-48968) antagonists before allergen challenge failed to reduce the allergic early airway responses. In contrast, both neurokinin antagonists decreased allergen-induced late airway responses in OA-challenged animals. However, only the NK-2 antagonist decreased the eosinophil numbers in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), Likewise, the NK-2, but not NK-1, antagonist decreased both Th1 (INF-gamma) and Th2 (IL-4 and -5) cytokine expression in BAL cells by in situ hybridization. These results provide initial in vivo evidence linking neurokinins to the regulation of cytokine expression in cells without discrimination as to their phenotype. We conclude that there is a dichotomy between NK receptors in the modulation of the allergic airway inflammation, which has important implications for future therapeutic strategies for asthma using the NK antagonists.

The purpose of this study was to compare the time course of muscular paralysis at the adductor pollicis muscle (AP) with use of acoustic myography and mechanomyography. Methods: Thirteen elective surgery patients, American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I, received rocuronium (0.6 mg/kg intravenously) as a bolus dose during general anesthesia. Force of AP was measured with use of a strain gauge, and sounds were recorded simultaneously with use of a small condenser microphone fixed on the palmar surface of the hand over the AP. Supramaximal stimulation was applied to the ulnar nerve at 0.1 Hz for 45-60 min, In seven patients, the response to train-of-four stimulation was also recorded during recovery. Results: Force and sounds both were equally sensitive in measuring maximum block. The relation between sound and force was curvilinear, with good agreement near 0 and 100% and acoustic response exceeding mechanical response at intermediate levels of block The acoustic signal had a slower onset and a faster recovery than the force response. The fade response of sound to train-of-four stimulation also recovered faster than that of force. Conclusion: Acoustic myography is an alternative method to monitor muscular paralysis that is easy to set up and applicable to most superficial muscles. However, the time course of relaxation at AP using acoustic myography differs from the time course of force relaxation, Therefore, these two methods are not equivalent when applied to AP.

To this aim, 20 patients having undergone brain surgery for the clipping of a unilateral left (LBS), right (RBS) or bilateral (BBS) aneurysm(s) of the MCA and 20 neurologically intact control subjects (NC) were evaluated with a series of tests assessing most of the abilities involved in music recognition. In general, the study shows that a ruptured aneurysm on the MCA that is repaired by brain surgery is very likely to produce deficits in the auditory processing of music. The incidence of such a deficit was not only very high but also selective. The results show that the LBS group was more impaired than the NC group in all three tasks involving musical long-term memory, The study also uncovered two new cases of apperceptive agnosia for music. These two patients (N.R. and R.C.) were diagnosed as such because both exhibit a clear deficit in each of the three music memory tasks and both are impaired in all discrimination tests involving musical perception. Interestingly, the lesions overlap in the right superior temporal lobe and in the right insula, making the two new cases very similar to an earlier case report. Altogether, the results are also consistent with the view that apperceptive agnosia results from damage to right hemispheric structures while associative agnosia results from damage to the left hemisphere.

The signal of choline-containing compounds (Cho) observed by H-1 magnetic resonance spectroscopy is constituted of metabolites of phosphatidylcholine, especially phosphocholine (PCho) and glycerophosphocholine (GPCho). The phosphomonoester (PME) and phosphodiester (PDE) signals observed by P-31 magnetic resonance spectroscopy are, respectively, precursors and catabolites of phospholipids. A large number of brain diseases have been reported to cause variations in the intensity of the Cho, PME and PDE signals. Changes in the activity of phospholipase A(2) have been measured in many brain diseases. In this review, the relationships between the results of H-1 and P-31 magnetic resonance spectroscopy and the phospholipase A(2) assays are analyzed. In many brain diseases, the variation in the Cho signal intensity can be correlated with a stimulation or inhibition of the phospholipase A(2) activity. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

The current study compared two groups of patients who had surgical resection for colorectal adenocarcinoma. METHODS: The case group was composed of 34 patients younger than 40 (34 +/- 4) years. Detailed pathologic prognosis factors, tumor cell proliferation measured by proliferating cell nuclear antigen, survival, family history, and predisposing conditions were analyzed. Results were compared with a control group constituted of 34 patients older than 65 (75 +/- 6) years matched by gender, cancer site, and Dukes stage. RESULTS: Tumor differentiation, presence of vascular and perineural neoplastic invasion, tumor growth pattern, tumor cell proliferation measured by proliferating cell nuclear antigen count, and survival according to the Kaplan-Meier method were not significantly different between younger and older patients. The only difference between the two groups was a higher prevalence of family history and predisposing conditions for colorectal cancer in younger patients (23 vs 3 percent; P = 0.03). CONCLUSION: This case-control study documents that pathologic features and prognosis of colorectal adenocarcinoma are comparable in patients younger than 40 years compared with older patients fur identical stages. The higher prevalence of positive family history in younger patients suggests a different genetic background compared with older patients.

Going more deeply into the research with rhythmometric investigations reveals that the temporal organization of psychophysiological functions involving several oscillatory systems may compose possible circadian paradigms of brain integration and pathological chronorisk for clinical neuroscience (seizure susceptibility for epilepsy and related states, brain circulatory disturbances, stress-related events, emotional or affective manifestations, and psychosomatic disorders). Rhythmometrically analyzed, the temporal fluctuations of behavioural events tend to indicate that cerebral integrations are circadian, circaseptidian or infradian stage-dependent processes whose chronobiologic characteristics are possibly predictable on the basis of mathematical models. More generally, the present study reveals that. 1) several neurological or psychiatric disorders are directly or indirectly concerned with chronobiologic processes, and that 2) cerebral and behavioural time variations can be detected and described in neurology and psychiatry as algorithmically formulatable recurring psychophysiological changes with a waveform validated by inferential statistical computer methods. Such rhythmometric procedures applied to neurological or psychiatric events suggest also the development of new epistemological concepts in the fields of comparative psychophysiology and theoretical neuroscience.

EEC responses to intermittent photic stimulation depend on the age and sex of the subject and on how stimulation is performed: abnormalities:are commonest in children and adolescents, especially girls. Only generalised paroxysmal epileptiform discharges are clearly linked to epilepsy. Abnormal responses may occur in asymptomatic subjects, especially children. Photosensitivity has an important genetic component. Some patients are sensitive to patterns, suggesting an occipital trigger for these events. Myoclonus and generalised convulsive and nonconvulsive seizures may be triggered by visual stimuli. Partial seizures occur less often and can be confused with migraine. Although usually idiopathic, photosensitive epilepsy may occur in degenerative diseases and some patients with photosensitive partial seizures have brain lesions. Sunlight and video screens, including television, video games, and computer displays, are the commonest environmental triggers of photosensitive seizures. Outbreaks of triggered seizures have occurred when certain flashing or patterned images have been broadcast. There are regulations to prevent this in some countries only. Pure photosensitive epilepsy has a good prognosis. There is a role for treatment with and without antiepileptic drugs, but photosensitivity usually does not disappear spontaneously, and then typically in the third decade.

Methods: We studied retrospectively 42 patients (26 men) evaluated between 1982 and 1999. MRI, neuropsychological findings, interictal and ictal scalp EEC were reviewed for all patients. Fifteen patients had additional stereo EEG (SEEG) studies: Results: The mean age at encephalitis was 17 years (SD = 15.5); etiology was identified in 18 patients. During the acute illness, 79% had status epilepticus (SE) or recurrent seizures and 76% were in coma; mean Glasgow outcome scale (COS) was 3.6 (SD = 0.8). The mean latency to seizure onset was 0.8 years (SD = 1.9). The majority (72%) presented with complex partial seizures with or without secondary generalization. According to interictal epileptiform findings and the predominant seizure onset pattern as found on scalp EEC, patients were unilateral temporal (UTLE) = 8, bilateral temporal (BTLE) = 12, and extratemporal/multifocal or generalized (ETMFE) = 22 patients. MRI atrophy and/or signal changes were unilateral temporal in 7 (18%), bilateral temporal in 5 (13%), multilobar/diffuse in 20 (51%), and absent in 7 (18%). ANOVA revealed significant differences in mean GOS between UTLE versus BTLE and ETMFE (4.7 Versus 3.2 versus 3.6; p < 0.0001), but not in age at encephalitis. Latency to the first unprovoked seizure was shorter in patients with ETMFE compared to UTLE and BTLE (p < 0.01). Surgery was performed in 24 patients. The best outcome was obtained in UTLE (7/8 class I and ii). In the others, outcome was poor in the majority (13/16 class III and IV). Conclusion: There is a small subgroup of patients with postencephalitic UTLE for whom the outcome is favorable. The majority of our patients had multifocal seizure onset with BTLE and ETMFE, and poor outcome after surgical treatment.

GDNF also causes an enhancement of dopamine release by a mechanism which is presently unclear. Using isolated dopaminergic neurons of the rat ventral tegmental area in culture, we have tested the hypothesis that GDNF regulates the establishment and functional properties of synaptic terminals. Previous studies have shown that single dopaminergic neurons in culture can co-release glutamate in addition to dopamine, leading to the generation of a fast excitatory autaptic current via glutamate receptors, Using excitatory autaptic currents as an assay for the activity of synapses established by identified dopaminergic neurons, we found that chronically applied GDNF produced a threefold increase in the amplitude of excitatory autaptic currents. This action was specific for dopaminergic neurons because GDNF had no such effect on ventral tegmental area GABAergic neurons. The enhancement of excitatory autaptic current amplitude caused by GDNF was accompanied by an increase in the frequency of spontaneous miniature excitatory autaptic currents. These observations confirmed a presynaptic locus of change. We identified synaptic terminals by using synapsin-l immunofluorescence. In single tyrosine hydroxylase-positive neurons, the number of synapsin-positive puncta which represent putative synaptic terminals was found to be approximately doubled in GDNF-treated cells at 5, 10 and 15 days in culture. The number of such morphologically identified terminals in isolated GASAergic neurons was unchanged by GDNF. These results suggest that one mechanism through which GDNF may enhance dopamine release is through promoting the establishment of new functional synaptic terminals.

Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) is a 32 kDa stress protein that degrades heme to biliverdin, free iron and carbon monoxide. Our laboratory has shown that cysteamine, dopamine, beta -amyloid, IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha up-regulate HO-1 followed by mitochondrial sequestration of non-transferrin-derived Fe-55 in cultured rat astroglia. In these cells and in rat astroglia transfected with the human HO-1 gene, mitochondrial iron trapping is abrogated by the HO-1 inhibitors, tin-mesoporphyrin and dexamethasone. We determined that HO-1 immunoreactivity is enhanced greatly in neurons and astrocytes of the hippocampus and cerebral cortex of Alzheimer subjects and co-localizes to senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFT). HO-1 staining is also augmented in astrocytes and decorates neuronal Lewy bodies in the Parkinson nigra. Collectively, our findings suggest that HO-1 over-expression contributes to the pathological iron deposition and mitochondrial damage documented in these aging-related neurodegenerative disorders. We recently observed that, paradoxically, HO-1 mRNA levels are markedly suppressed in peripheral lymphocytes of patients with early sporadic Alzheimer disease and may thus provide a useful biological marker of this condition.

Previously, GUESS included three major scheduling approaches: a heuristic-based (suggestion tabulator) approach, a hill-climbing algorithm, and a genetic algorithm approach. GUESS has now been expanded to include a neural network scheduling approach. This paper discusses the development, implementation and testing results of the neural network scheduling method within GUESS.

The possibility was examined that GnRHs are present and bioactive in cnidarians, considered to be representatives of the most primitive animals possessing a nervous system. Immunoreactive GnRH was detected in endodermal neurons of two anthozoans, the sea pansy Renilla koellikeri and the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis. In the sea pansy, immunoreactivity was detected throughout the auto-zooid polyps, including gamete-producing endoderm. High-performance liquid chromatography and radioimmunoassays of extracts from whole sea pansy colonies yielded two elution peaks exhibiting GnRH immunoreactivity with antisera raised against shark or mammalian GnRH. Vertebrate GnRHs as well as the two sea pansy GnRH-like factors inhibited the amplitude and frequency of peristaltic contractions in the sea pansy, and these actions were blocked by the LHRH analog [D-pGlu(1),D-Phe(2),D-Trp(3,6)]-LHRH. These results suggest that the GnRH family of neuropeptides is more widespread in metazoans than previously thought. Although our physiological data are preliminary, they point to a role for GnRHs as inhibitory modulators of neuromuscular transmission in the sea pansy. (C) 2000 Academic Press.

We have cloned a full-length cDNA encoding rat dynein light chain protein, robl/LC7-like (class 1), from visual cortex. We found that rat robl/LC7-like gene is highly expressed in neocortex and displays the unusual feature of being rapidly down-regulated by sensory stimulation. This effect was seen at both mRNA and protein levels in visual cortex, being detectable in as little as 45 min after the onset of visual stimulation. Down-regulation by sensory stimulation was also found within ocular dominance columns of area V1 in monocularly deprived monkeys. Our results suggest a high turnover rate of the robl/LC7-like protein and the presence of a repressor mechanism in neurons that is tightly coupled to synaptic stimulation.

To gain insight into the mechanisms underlying this process, we monitored in parallel the migration of the NT1 neurotensin receptor subtype and a fluorescent analog of NT (fluo-NT) in COS-7 cells transfected with a tagged NT1 construct. Fluo-NT internalization was prevented by hgpertonic sucrose, potassium depletion and cytosol acidification, demonstrating that it proceeded via clathrin-coated pits, Within 0-30 minutes, fluo-NT accumulated together with its receptor in Acridine Orange-positive, acidic organelles, These organelles concentrated transferrin and immunostained positively for rab 5A, therefore they were early endosomes, After 30-45 minutes, the ligand and its receptor no longer colocalized, Fluo-NT was first found in rab 7-positive late endosomes and later in a nonacidic juxtanuclear compartment identified as the Trans-Golgi Network (TGN) by virtue of its staining for syntaxin 6. This juxtanuclear compartment also stained positively for rab 7 and for the TGN/pericentriolar recycling endosome marker rab 11, suggesting that the ligand could have been recruited to the TGN from either late or recycling endosomes, By that time, internalized receptors were detected in Lamp-l-immunoreactive lysosomes, These results demonstrate that neurotensin/NT1 receptor complexes follow a recycling cycle that is unique among the G protein-coupled receptors studied to date, and provide the first evidence for the targeting of a nonendogenous protein from endosomes to the TGN.

We studied the effects of sensory habituation on the neural encoding of sound Localization cues using crickets as a model system. In crickets, Teleogryllus oceanicus, sound localization is based on binaural comparison of stimulus intensity. There are two potential codes at the receptor-neuron level for interaural intensity difference: interaural difference in response strength, i.e. spike rate and/or count, and interaural difference in response latency. These are affected differently by sensory habituation, When crickets are stimulated with cricket-song-like trains of sound pulses, response strength declines for successive pulses in the train, and the decrease becomes more pronounced as the stimulus intensity increases. Response decrement is thus greater for receptors serving the ear ipsilateral to the sound source, where intensity is higher, resulting in a decrease in the interaural difference in response strength. Sensory habituation also affects response latency, which increases for responses to successive sound pulses in the stimulus train. The change in latency is independent of intensity, and thus is similar for receptors serving both ears. As a result, interaural latency difference is unaffected by sensory habituation and may be a more reliable cue for sound localization.

The neuron is tuned to frequencies similar to that of conspecific songs (4.5 kHz), but its latency is longest for these same frequencies by a margin of 5-10 ms. Each ON1 is strongly excited by input from the ipsilateral ear and inhibits contralateral auditory neurons that are excited by the contralateral ear, including the interneurons ascending neurons 1 and 2 (AN1 and AN2). We investigated the functional consequences of ON1's long latency to cricket-like sound and the resulting delay in inhibition of AN1 and AN2. Using dichotic stimuli, we controlled the timing of contralateral inhibition of the ANs relative to their excitation by ipsilateral stimuli. Advancing the stimulus to the ear driving ON1 relative to that driving the ANs "subtracted" ON1's additional latency to 4.5 kHz. This had little effect on the spike counts of AN1 and AN2. The response latencies of these neurons, however, increased markedly. This is because in the absence of a delay in ON1's response, inhibition arrived at AN1 and AN2 early enough to abolish the first spikes in their responses. This also increased the variability of AN1 latency. This suggests that one possible function of the delay in ON1's response may be to protect the precise timing of the onset of response in the contralateral AN1, thus preserving interaural difference in response latency as a reliable potential cue for sound localization. Hyperpolarizing ON1 removed all detectable contralateral inhibition of AN1 and AN2, suggesting that ON1 is the main, if not the only, source of contralateral inhibition.

J	Buss, RR; Drapeau, P				Buss, RR; Drapeau, P			Physiological properties of zebrafish embryonic red and white muscle fibers during early development	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article							TELEOST BRACHYDANIO-RERIO; NEUROMUSCULAR-JUNCTION; MYOTOMAL MUSCLE; POSTHATCHING DEVELOPMENT; ACETYLCHOLINE-RECEPTORS; IDENTIFIED MOTONEURONS; SPINAL MOTONEURONS; IN-VIVO; FISH; DIFFERENTIATION	The zebrafish is a model organism for studies of vertebrate muscle differentiation and development. However, an understanding of fish muscle physiology during this period is limited. We examined the membrane, contractile, electrical coupling, and synaptic properties of embryonic red (ER) and white (EW) muscle fibers in developing zebrafish from 1 to 5 days postfertilization. Resting membrane potentials were -73 mV in 1 day ER and -78 mV in 1 day EW muscle and depolarized 17 and 7 mV, respectively, by 5 days. Neither fiber type exhibited action potentials. Current-voltage relationships were linear in EW fibers and day 1 ER fibers but were outwardly rectifying in some ER fibers at 3 to 5 days. Both ER and EW fibers were contractile at all ages examined (1 to 5 days) and could follow trains of electrical stimulation of up to 30 Hz without fatiguing for up to 5 min. Synaptic activity consisting of miniature endplate potentials (mEPPs) was observed at the earliest ages examined (1.2-1.4 days) in both ER and EW fibers. Synaptic activity increased in frequency, and mEPP amplitudes were larger by 5 days. Miniature EPP rise times and half-widths decreased in ER fibers by 5 days, while EW fiber mEPPs showed fast kinetics as early as 1.2-1.4 days. ER and EW muscle fibers showed extensive dye coupling but not heterologous (red-white) coupling. Dye coupling decreased by 3 days yet remained at 5 days. Somites were electrically coupling, and this allowed filtered synaptic potentials to spread from myotome to myotome. It is concluded that at early developmental stages the physiological properties of ER and EW muscle are similar but not identical and are optimized to the patterns of swimming observed at these stages.

This property is particularly attractive as a possible mechanism for the ensemble coding of information in the nervous system because it operates rapidly and has high storage capacity. For a population of neurons which exhibits statistical periodicity, information would not be encoded by the periodicity, but rather by the spatio-temporal distributions of neural activity. Statistical periodicity is discussed in relation to the temporal binding hypothesis and to the occurrence of multistability in neural systems.

Administration of melatonin stimulates cell-mediated immunity, particularly by inhibiting apoptosis among T lymphocytes in the thymus and inducing production of T-cell-derived cytokines. However, its possible effects on the humoral immune system are unclear. In the present study, we have examined whether melatonin may influence the in vivo development of B lymphocytes in mouse bone marrow, a process in which apoptosis is normally a prominent feature. Double immunofluorescence labeling and flow cytometry were used to quantitate phenotypically defined precursor B-cell and mature B-cell populations and their apoptotic rates in bone marrow of mice fed either melatonin-containing or control diet for 16 days from 9 wk of age. In short-term bone marrow cultures, the incidence of apoptosis among large pre-B cells, including cells expressing the lambda 5 component of pre-B-cell receptor, was markedly reduced in melatonin-treated mice, associated with an increase in the absolute number of large pre-B cells in bone marrow. In contrast, apoptosis of earlier precursor B cells and mature B lymphocytes did not differ from control values. The results indicate that orally administered melatonin can substantially promote the survival of precursor B cells in mouse bone marrow. Melatonin treatment may thus boost the survival of newly formed B cells mediating humoral immunity.

Design: Polymorphisms located in genes that code for GABRA3, GABRA5 and GABRB3 subunits of the GABA, receptor were investigated using association and linkage strategies. Participants: A total of 138 patients with bipolar I disorder with a clear response to lithium prophylaxis, selected from specialized lithium clinics in Canada and Europe that are part of the International Group for the Study of Lithium-treated Patients, and 108 psychiatrically healthy controls. Families of 24 probands were suitable for linkage analysis. Outcome measures: The association between the candidate genes and patients with bipolar disorder versus that of controls and genetic linkage within families. Results: There was no significant association or linkage found between lithium-responsive bipolar disorder and the GABAergic candidate genes investigated. Conclusions: This study does not support a major role for the GABAergic candidate genes tested in lithium-responsive bipolar disorder.

Design: Prospective study. Participants: Six healthy men and 5 healthy women. Intervention: Participants' brains were scanned with positron-emission tomography (PET) after intravenous injection of alpha-[(11)C]methyl-L-tryptophan (alpha-[(11)C]MTrp). Outcome measures: Tissue radioactivity images were converted into functional images using the Patlak plot approach, and analyzed with 2 methods for global normalization in the SPM program: proportional scaling and analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). Results: The data structure suggests that PET alpha-[(11)C]MTrp data meet the criteria for analysis with SPM, and that the proportional scaling method is more appropriate than the ANCOVA method for normalization. Regional differences in 5-HT synthesis were identified between men and women, and the significance of these findings was supported by region of interest (ROI) analyses. Conclusion: SPM analyses of PET alpha-[(11)C]MTrp data may be of value for identifying regional differences in brain 5-HT synthesis between groups, and in investigating the effects of psychotropic drugs. Since we found regional differences between male and female subjects, men and women should not be grouped for data analysis in PET alpha-[(11)C]MTrp studies.

Design: Prospective animal study. Animals: Sprague-Dawley rats. Outcome measures: Modifications of the sensitivity of somatodendritic and postsynaptic 5-HTIA receptors using in vivo electrophysiological paradigms in animals treated with vehicle or (+/-)pindolol (20 mg/kg/day, subcutaneously) through osmotic minipumps for 2 weeks. Results: (+/-)Pindolol attenuated the suppressant effect of the 5-HT autoreceptor agonist lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) on the firing activity of 5-HT neurons, suggesting that (+/-)pindolol antagonized somatodendritic 5-HTIA autoreceptors in the dorsal raphe nucleus. However, following a 2-day washout period, the suppressant effect of LSD was still attenuated, indicating rather a desensitization of 5-HTIA autoreceptors had occurred. In the CA(3) region of the dorsal hippocampus, (+/-)pindolol treatment did not modify the responsiveness of postsynaptic 5-HTIA receptors to microiontophoretic applications of 5-HT. Moreover, such a treatment modified neither the effectiveness of the electrical stimulation of 5-HT fibers nor the function of terminal 5-HT autoreceptors. Finally, the administration of the selective 5-HTIA receptor antagonist WAY 100635 (100 mu g/kg, intravenously) did not increase the firing activity of dorsal hippocampus CA(3) pyramidal neurons in rats treated with (+/-)pindolol, thus failing to reveal the enhanced tonic activation of postsynaptic 5-HTIA receptors associated with major classes of antidepressant treatments. Conclusion: Prolonged administration of (+/-)pindolol by itself is not sufficient to enhance overall 5-HT neurotransmission; pindolol should therefore not be endowed with intrinsic antidepressant activity. Although pindolol is capable of antagonizing the 5-HTIA autoreceptor upon the initiation of a 5-HT reuptake-blocker treatment, it also induces a desensitization of this 5-HTIA autoreceptor, which could explain why patients do not relapse upon its discontinuation when they continue taking a 5-HT reuptake blocker.

In the present study, eight medication-free remitted patients with MDD, seasonal pattern, were tested twice, once following the ingestion of a tryptophan-containing mixture, once following ATD, ATD significantly increased Hamilton depression scores (p < 0.001). Four of the patients had a family history of psychiatric disorders: substance abuse (n = 4), mood disorders (n = 3) or Cluster B personality disorders (n = 3). The mood-lowering response to ATD was significantly greater in those patients with, than without, affected relatives (p < 0.001). These preliminary findings (1) support the hypothesis that depressed states are related to disturbed serotonin neurotransmission and (2) suggest that depressive symptoms following ATD might identify a subgroup of patients at high genetic risk for disorders associated with affective lability and dysregulated impulse-control, conditions thought to be related to low serotonin neurotransmission.

Early work showed that this was due to the destructive interaction of adjacent contours (termed contour interaction). It has been assumed to have a neural basis, and a number of competing explanations have been advanced that implicate either high-level or low-level stages of visual processing. Our previous results for foveal vision suggested a much simpler explanation, one determined primarily by the physics of the stimulus rather than the physiology of the visual system. me show that, under conditions of contour interaction or crowding, the most relevant physical spatial-frequency band of the letter is displaced to higher spatial frequencies and that foveal vision tracks this change in spatial scale. In the periphery, however, beyond 5 degrees, the physical explanation is not sufficient. Here we show that there are genuine physiological lateral spatial interactions, which are due to changes in the spatial scale of analysis.

During such exploratory scan paths, gaze frequently strays from and then returns to salient features. How the brain keeps track of major end-gears and intermediate subgoals is not understood. We studied the discharge of fixation neurons of the brainstem's superior colliculus during multiple-step gaze shifts composed of a sequence of saccades made in the dark and separated by short periods of steady fixation. Cells were initially silent. As sequential gaze saccades approached the goal, firing began; its frequency increased progressively and peaked when gaze was on the remembered target location. We conclude that these fixation neurons encode the error between desired and actual gaze positions, irrespective of trajectory characteristics.

This method is aimed at detecting differences in radioligand binding between baseline and activation scans. It uses nonlinear least squares theory to estimate the ligand-receptor model parameters and utilizes the residuals to calculate their associated variance. The approach both increases the degrees of freedom for statistical testing and produces more accurate estimates of the standard deviation of the parameters. This technique is applicable to any ligand with a validated compartmental model, whether reversibly or irreversibly bound. The method was investigated and compared with a simple voxel-wise t test. Both simulated and real PET data for the dopamine D-1 receptor ligand [C-11]SCH 23390 were used to assess the method. The assumptions implicit in the residuals methods were validated. The residuals method was found to be more sensitive than a simple t test, while not producing false-positive results. In addition, we showed that this method reliably differentiates changes in radioligand binding from the effects of changes in cerebral blood how. (C) 2000 Academic Press.

J	MacDonald, D; Kabani, N; Avis, D; Evans, AC				MacDonald, D; Kabani, N; Avis, D; Evans, AC			Automated 3-D extraction of inner and outer surfaces of cerebral cortex from MRI	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							HUMAN-BRAIN; ATLAS; SULCUS; SPACE	Automatic computer processing of large multidimensional images such as those produced by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is greatly aided by deformable models, which are used to extract, identify, and quantify specific neuroanatomic structures. A general method of deforming polyhedra is presented here, with two novel features, First, explicit prevention of self-intersecting surface geometries is provided, unlike conventional deformable models, which use regularization constraints to discourage but not necessarily prevent such behavior. Second, deformation of multiple surfaces with intersurface proximity constraints allows each surface to help guide other surfaces into place using model-based constraints such as expected thickness of an anatomic surface. These two features are used advantageously to identify automatically the total surface of the outer and inner boundaries of cerebral cortical gray matter from normal human MR images, accurately locating the depths of the sulci, even where noise and partial volume artifacts in the image obscure the visibility of sulci. The extracted surfaces are enforced to be simple two-dimensional manifolds (having the topology of a sphere), even though the data may have topological holes, This automatic 3-D cortex segmentation technique has been applied to 150 normal subjects, simultaneously extracting both the gray/white and gray/cerebrospinal fluid interface from each individual. The collection of surfaces has been used to create a spatial map of the mean and standard deviation for the location and the thickness of cortical gray matter. Three alternative criteria for defining cortical thickness at each cortical location were developed and compared. These results are shown to corroborate published postmortem and in vivo measurements of cortical thickness. (C) 2000 Academic Press.

The present in vivo electrophysiological studies were undertaken, in the rat, to assess the effects of the coadministration of venlafaxine, a dual 5-HT/NE reuptake inhibitor, and (-)pindolol on pre- and postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptor function. The acute administration of venlafaxine and of the SSRI paroxetine (5 mg/kg, i.v.) induced a suppression of the firing activity of dorsal hippocampus CA(3) pyramidal neurons. This effect of venlafaxine was markedly potentiated by a pretreatment with (-)pindolol (15 mg/kg, i.p.) but not by the selective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist metoprolol (15 mg/kg, i.p.). That this effect of venlafaxine was mediated by an activation of postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptors was suggested by its complete reversal by the 5-HT1A antagonist WAY 100635 (100 mu g/kg, i.v.). A short-term treatment with VLX (20 mg/kg/day x 2 days) resulted in a ca. 90% suppression of the firing activity of 5-HT neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus. This was prevented by the coadministration of (-)pindolol (15 mg/kg/day x 2 days). Taken together, these results indicate that (-)pindolol potentiated the activation of postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptors resulting from 5-HT reuptake inhibition probably by blocking the somatodendritic 5-HT1A autoreceptor, but not its postsynaptic congener. These results support and extend previous findings providing a biological substratum for the efficacy of pindolol as an accelerating strategy in major depression.

In birds, nesting habits, sexually selected traits, migration, clutch size and body mass have been suggested as important variables, but behavioural flexibility is another obvious trait that has received little attention. Behavioural flexibility allows animals to respond more rapidly to environmental changes and can therefore be advantageous when invading novel habitats. Behavioural flexibility is linked to relative brain size and, for foraging, has been operationalised as the number of innovations per taxon reported in the short note sections of ornithology journals. Here, we use data on avian species introduced to New Zealand and rest the link between forebrain size, feeding innovation frequency and invasion success. Relative brain size was, as expected, a significant predictor of introduction success, after removing the effect of introduction effort. Species with relatively larger brains tended to be better invaders than species with smaller ones. Introduction effort, migratory strategy and mode of juvenile development were also significant in the models. Pair-wise comparisons of closely related species indicate that successful invaders also showed a higher frequency of foraging innovations in their region of origin. This study provides the first evidence in vertebrates of a general set of traits, behavioural flexibility, that can potentially favour invasion success.

Cognitive changes in normal ageing realize a plurality of possible patterns of cognitive disabilities. Dementias are also well known to be characterized by a plurality of cognitive impairments patterns. The different cognitive patterns are likely to be due to distinct levels of impairments of different domains of cognition, or of different components within one given domain of cognition. These differences are such that in some cases they can even realize double dissociations. The plurality of cognitive impairments patterns in normal aging and in dementia will be discussed as well as the different factors that could contribute to such a plurality. Some of these factors relate to pre-morbid characteristics of the individuals known to influence the functional organization of the brain for cognition. Others - of major importance - are related to the nature and the distribution of the pathophysiological processes underlying normal ageing or a given degenerative disease. It is also reminded that some or many of these factors can interact with more general cognitive factors, such as speed of execution. It is however suggested that despite of their presence, these general factors partly contribute to the cognitive impairments in neurodegenerative dementia. in this case, the impact of different disease-related factors over a general cognitive factor is probably much greater than in the case of normal aging.

To investigate possible changes in the central serotonin system of these mice, HPLC measurements of 5-hydroxytryptophan, 5-hydroxy-tryptamine (serotonin; 5-HT), and 5-HT metabolites were obtained from 22 brain regions and the spinal cord of wild type and dt(J)/dt(J) mutant mice. Also, 5-HT transporters were quantified by [H-3]citalopram autoradiography in 72 brain regions, subregions, and nuclei, and the 5-HT innervation visualized by immunocytochemistry throughout the brain and spinal cord. In all brain regions measured for indoleamine content, there were no significant differences between the two genotypes. In the spinal cord, an increased tissue concentration of 5-HT (+34%), 5-hydroxyindole-3-acetic acid (+33%), 5-hydroxytryptophol (+21%), and 5-hydroxytryptophan (+45%) in dt(J)/dt(J) actually corresponded to the same total amount of each of these indoleamines in the entire spinal cord, when taking into account its reduced size in the mutants. Quantification of the binding to 5-HT transporters showed increases in the medial geniculate nucleus (+14%), medial (+24%) and lateral(+18%) hypothalamus, interpeduncular (+13%) vestibular (+22%), and deep cerebellar nuclei (+37%) of dt(J)/dt mice, and decreases in the ventral tegmental area ( -13%), median and linear raphe nuclei (-20%), as well as in the solitary complex (-35%). There were no apparent differences in the distribution of 5-HT-immunostained fibers in these and other regions of brain and in the spinal cord of dt(J)/dt(J) compared to wild type mice. The bulk of these results indicates a relative sparing of the central 5-HT system in the dt(J)/dt(J) mice, even though alterations in 5-HT transporters could justify attempts at improving the sensorimotor dysfunction by administration of serotoninergic agents in these mice.

The complete absence of the receptor in healthy tissues makes it an ideal tumor marker. We sought to design a peptide ligand against EGFRvIII for development as a diagnostic imaging agent, We used the concept of hydropathic complementarity to search for sequences whose amino acid sidechains display a reciprocal pattern of hydropathicity to those of the deletion junction of EGFRvIII. The resulting peptide (PEPHC1) was synthesized and tested for binding to EGFRvIII and EGFR. In in vitro assays, PEPHC1 bound the recombinant EGFRvIII extracellular domain or full-length EGFRvIII solubilized from cell membranes in preference to native EGFR. These results demonstrate the utility of hydropathic complementarity as a basis for the design of highly specific ligands that may prove useful as tumor-targeting agents, (C) 2000 Academic Press.

Whereas transcripts encoding both enzymes are widely distributed in the central nervous system, information regarding the localization of proteins themselves is still lacking. In an attempt to gain insight into the neurobiologic roles of PC1 and PC2, both enzymes were immunolocalized in the rat brain by using C-terminally directed antibodies, which respectively recognize the 87-kDa PC1 and the 75 and 68-kDa PC2 forms. Adjacent sections immunoreacted with PCI or PC2 antibodies exhibited selective patterns of immunostaining in regions well characterized with respect to their biosynthesis of multiple neuropeptides such as the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and hypothalamus. PCI signal intensity was generally weaker than that of PC2, although both enzymes displayed extensive overlapping patterns of expression. As assessed by double-labeling experiments at the cellular level, PC1 and PC2 immunoreactive signals were localized within the trans-Golgi network and nerve terminals, in keeping with the biosynthetic pathways of neuropeptides. Immunoreactive fibers were detected in many areas throughout the brain but were particularly densely distributed in the hypothalamus and the brainstem. Both enzymes were also localized within dendrites of numerous neurons, supporting the hypothesis that dendritic neuropeptide maturation and release may occur in a large number of brain regions. Taken together, our results provide new evidence that both convertases are efficiently targeted to the neuronal regulated secretory pathway and are well poised to process protein precursors in biologically active end-products within the mammalian brain.

In vitro studies have suggested that the prohormone convertases PC5A and PC2 might both be involved in this process. In the present study, we used dual immunohistochemical techniques to determine whether either one or both of these two convertases were co-localized with pro-NT/NN maturation products and could therefore be involved in the physiological processing of this propeptide in rat brain. PC2-immunoreactive neurons were present in all regions immunopositive for NT. All but three regions expressing NT were also immunopositive for PC5A. Dual localization of NT with either convertase revealed that NT was extensively co-localized with both PC5A and PC2, albeit with regional differences. These results strongly suggest that PC5A and PC2 may play a key role in the maturation of pro-NT/NN in mammalian brain. The regional variability in NT/PC co-localization patterns may account for the region-specific maturation profiles previously reported for pro-NT/NN. The high degree of overlap between PC5A and PC2 in most NT-rich areas further suggests that these two convertases may act jointly to process pro-NT/NN. At the subcellular level, PC5A was largely co-localized with the mid-cisternae Golgi marker MG-160. By contrast, PC2 was almost completely excluded from MG-160-immunoreactive compartments. These results suggest that PC5A, which is particularly efficient at cleaving the two C-terminal-most dibasics of pro-NT/NN, may be acting as early as in the Golgi apparatus to release NT, whereas PC2, which is considerably more active than PC5A in cleaving the third C-terminal doublet, may be predominantly involved further distally along the secretory pathway to release NN.

Twelve normal volunteers were scanned while smelling pairs of odors: they were asked to judge which odor was more pleasant in one condition, and which was more intense in a second condition; they also were scanned while sniffing an odorless stimulus. As in prior studies, greater cerebral blood flow was found in the right orbitofrontal cortex during both pleasantness and intensity judgments as compared to baseline. Cerebellar activity was also seen, but contrary to expectations no activity was detected in the primary olfactory (piriform) cortex. Only the pleasantness judgment elicited additional activity within the hypothalamus, suggesting that this structure may be involved in affective processing that requires access to information about internal state.

J. (1996) Neurosci. Lett. 209, 57-60). The role of 14-3-3 in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis is not known. In this study, we found that the 14-3-3 zeta isoform is associated with tau in brain extract and profoundly stimulates cAMP-dependent protein kinase catalyzed in vitro phosphorylation on Ser(262)/Ser(356) located within the microtubule-binding region of tan. 14-3-3 zeta binds to both phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated tau, and the binding site is located within the microtubule-binding region of tan. From brain extract, 14-3-3 zeta co-purifies with microtubules, and tubulin blocks 14-3-3 zeta-tau binding. Among four 14-3-3 isoforms tested, beta and zeta but not gamma and epsilon associate with tau. Our data suggest that 14-3-3(zeta) is a tau protein effector and may be involved in the abnormal tau phosphorylation occurring during Alzheimer's disease ontogeny.

First, we measured the intensity of SST2A immunoreactivity, using quantitative light microscopic immunocytochemistry, and levels of SST2A mRNA, using semiquantitative RT-PCR, under conditions of acute SRIF release blockade. Incubation of slices from the claustrum or basolateral amygdala, two regions previously shown to contain high concentrations of SST2A receptors, in Ca2+-free Ringer's for 40 min induced a decrease in the intensity of SST2A receptor immunoreactivity and concentration of SST2A mRNA as compared with control values obtained in Ca2+-supplemented Ringer's. These effects were counteracted in a dose-dependent manner by the addition of 10-100 nM [D-Trp(8)]-SRIF to the Ca2+-free medium. Furthermore, both of these effects were abolished in the presence of the endocytosis inhibitors phenylarsine oxide or hyperosmolar sucrose, suggesting that they were dependent on receptor internalization. Electron microscopic immunogold labeling confirmed the existence of an agonist-induced internalization of SST2A receptors in central neurons. At a high (10 mu M), but not at a low (10 nM), concentration of agonist this internalization resulted in a significant decrease in cell surface receptor density, irrespective of the presence of Ca2+ in the medium. Taken together, these results suggest that ligand-induced endocytosis is responsible for rapid transcriptional (increase in SST2A expression) and trafficking (loss of cell surface receptors) events involved in the control of the somatostatinergic signal.

LPL binds apolipoprotein E (apoE) lipoprotein particles and a major apoE receptor, low density lipoprotein receptor related protein (LRP). Because apoE and LRP polymorphisms alter Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk, and LPL itself is found in AD amyloid plaques, we examined whether LPL variants also affect AD risk. In case-control studies in the United States and Canada, the frequencies of two LPL alleles known to affect LPL enzymatic activity were measured in Caucasian AD or elderly normal (N) subjects. Pathologically confirmed subjects in both studies exhibited similar trends toward fewer 447Ter and more 291Ser alleles in AD. Combining results from both countries gave allele frequencies for 447Ter of 13.7% (26/190) in N and 9.4% (80/852) in AD (P = 0.10), and for 291Ser of 0.0% (0/184) in N and 1.3% (8/636) in AD (P = 0.21). The trend appeared even greater for homozygous 447Ter subjects: 4.2% (4/95) of N vs. 1.4% (6/426) of AD (P = 0.09). These trends are consistent with a putative protective effect of 447Ter and causative effect of 291Ser on AD. Furthermore, brains of AD patients with 447Ter showed trends toward fewer plaques, tangles, and glia, and more neurons and cortical thickness than AD patients without 447Ter. Hippocampal plaques were significantly reduced. LPL might affect hippocampal function and thus dementia via its role as supplier of membrane components or antioxidants to neurons. Alternatively, LPL may play a part in plaque formation through its interaction with apoE and LRP. (C) 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Similar INIs are found in oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy, which is caused by a short expansion of an alanine-encoding GCG repeat. Here we propose that transcriptional or translational frameshifts occurring within expanded CAG tracts result in the production and accumulation of polyalanine-containing mutant proteins. We hypothesize that these alanine polymers deposit in cells forming INIs and may contribute to nuclear toxicity. We show evidence that supports our hypothesis in lymphoblast cells from MJD patients, as well as in pontine neurons of MJD brain and in in vitro cell culture models of the disease. We also provide evidence that alanine polymers alone are harmful to cells and predict that a similar pathogenic mechanism may occur in the other CAG repeat disorders.

Conditions for the linear stability of the trivial solution of this system are represented in a parameter space consisting of the sum of the time delays between the elements and the product of the strengths of the connections between the elements. It is shown that the trivial fixed point may lose stability via a pitchfork bifurcation, a Hopf bifurcation, or one of three types of codimension-two bifurcations. Multistability near these latter bifurcations is predicted using center manifold analysis and confirmed using numerical simulations.

EPM2A codes for laforin, a protein with unknown function. Mutations have been reported in the last three of the gene's exons, To date, the first exon has not been determined conclusively. It has been predicted based on genomic DNA sequence analysis including comparison with the mouse homologue. Objectives: 1) To detect new mutations in exon 1 and establish the role of this exon in Lafora's disease. 2) To generate hypotheses about the biological function of laforin based on bioinformatic analyses. Methods: 1) PCR conditions and components were refined to allow amplification and sequencing of the first exon of EPM2A. 2) Extensive bioinformatic analyses of the primary structure of laforin were completed. Results: 1) Seven new mutations were identified in the putative exon 1. 2) Laforin is predicted not to localize to the cell membrane or any of the organelles. If contains all components of the catalytic active site of the family of dual-specificity phosphatases. It contains a sequence predicted to encode a carbohydrate binding domain (coded by exon 1) and two putative glucohydrolase catalytic sites. Conclusions: The identification of mutations in exon 1 of EPM2A establishes its role in the pathogenesis of Lafora's disease. The presence of potential carbohydrate binding and cleaving domains suggest a role for laforin in the prevention of accumulation of polyglucosans in healthy neurons.

These surface glycoproteins form a subset of the immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily and are very closely related, but differ in the precise sequence of their external domains and in their mode of anchorage to the cell membrane. CEA and CEACAM6 are glycophosphatidyl-inositol (GPI) anchored, whereas CEACAM1 is transmembrane (TM) anchored. Overexpression of GPI-linked neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) p125, also an adhesion molecule of the Ig superfamily, accelerates myogenic differentiation. The molecular requirements for the myogenic differentiation block were investigated using chimeric constructs in which the COOH-terminal hydrophobic domains of CEA, CEACAM1, and NCAM p125 were exchanged. The presence of the GPI signal sequence specifically from CEA in the chimeras was sufficient to convert both CEACAM1 and NCAM into diffrentiation-blocking proteins. Conversely, CEA could be converted into a neutral protein by exchanging its GPI anchor for the TM anchor of CEACAM1. Since the external domains of CEA, CEACAM1, and NCAM can all undergo hemophilic interactions, and mutations in the self-adhesive domains of CEA abrogate its differentiation-blocking activity, the structural requirements for differentiation-inhibition are any self-adhesive domains attached to the specific GPI anchor derived from CEA, We therefore suggest that biologically significant functional information resides in the processed extreme COOH terminus of CEA and in the GPI anchor that it determines.

Two mu M proSAAS selectively inhibits PC1 but not furin, PACE4, PC5A, or PC7. The PC1 inhibitory region of proSAAS was mapped to an 8-12-residue region near the C terminus that includes a critical Lys-Arg sequence. Synthetic peptides corresponding to this region are competitive inhibitors of PC1 with apparent K-i values of 14-40 nM. The inhibition becomes more effective with incubation time, indicating that the inhibitor is slow binding. A fusion protein containing the inhibitory region of proSAAS linked to the C terminus of glutathione S-transferase binds the 71-kDa form but not the 85-kDa form of PC1. This binding, which occurs at pH 5.5 and not at pH 7.4, is stable to incubation at room temperature for 1 h in the presence or absence of 0.5% Triton X-100 and/or 0.5 M NaCl. The removal of Ca2+ with chelating agents partially releases the bound PC1. High concentrations of the inhibitory peptide quantitatively release the bound PC1, Taken together, these data support the proposal that proSAAS functions as an endogenous inhibitor of PC1.

To test this concept, we used fMRI to determine whether acallosal patients have increased IMC activation with either complex or simple unilateral finger movements. Neither the localization of motor cortical regions activated, the volumes of activation, or the relative hemispheric lateralization of activations were different between the patients and normal controls. The potential callosal inhibitory pathway identified by TMS therefore does not appear to contribute to the interhemispheric suppression of physiologically relevant activations in the motor cortex as measured by fMRI.

Because diazepam reducer dopamine activity in the nucleus accumbens, three experiments were conducted in order to investigate whether diazepam selectively blocks the expression of place conditioning dependent on mesolimbic dopamine. The first experiment found that systemic diazepam blocked the expression of conditioned place aversion induced by the kappa-receptor agonist U50-488. The second and third experiments demonstrated that intra-cranial injections of diazepam in the nucleus accumbens blocked the expression of amphetamine CPP but not of morphine CPP. It is concluded that diazepam interferes with mesolimbic dopamine-dependent motivational effects of drugs. NeuroReport 11:2553-2557 (C) 2000 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

We compared transient outward K+ current (I-to) in single PCs from canine false tendons with midmyocardial ventricular myocytes (VMs). I-to reactivation was biexponential, with a similar rapid-phase time constant (30 +/- 5 and 35 +/- 4 ms for VM and PC, respectively) but a large, slow component in PCs with a much greater time constant than VM (1,427 +/- 70 vs. 181 +/- 24 ms, P < 0.001). Tetraethylammonium had no effect on VM I-to but reversibly inhibited PC I-to (IC50 = 2.4 +/- 0.4 mM). PC I-to was also more sensitive to 4-aminopyridine (IC50 = 50 +/- 7 vs. 526 +/- 49 mu M in VM, P < 0.0001). H2O2 slowed I-to inactivation in PCs but did not affect VM I-to. We conclude that PC I-to shows significant differences from VM I-to, with some features, such as tetraethylammonium sensitivity, that have been reported in neither cardiac I-to of atrial or ventricular myocytes nor cloned K+ channel subunits (Kv1.4, Kv4.2, or Kv4.3) known to participate in cardiac I-to.

ANNALES MEDICO-PSYCHOLOGIQUES			French	Article						mental categories; neurophilosophy; phenomenology; mind-body problem; psychophysiology; chronopsychology; theoretical psychiatry; epistemology		The thinking brain and the mind which is able to think of itself may both be considered attributes of being which are frequently beyond the grasp of reductive hermeneutics. The functional relationships which arise between brain and mind may be deciphered through the network of affective dynamics, yet the concept of psychophysiology can never entirely cover biological monism or the parallel concept of physiological psychology, Although the potential manifestation of adaptive behaviour is contained in the causality vectors of nervous tissue, brain tissue does not, however, contain the manifestation of thought in its functional virtuality. Exploring the inner syntax of mental life involved in the normal or abnormal thought can sheet a new light on the epistemological status of psychophysiology within the Human Sciences as well as on certain theoretical levels of cognitive neuroscience concerned by the concepts and the definitions of mind.

We have developed a reinstatement procedure that allows us to study the effect of stress on relapse to drug seeking in rats. Using this procedure, we have shown that exposure to intermittent footshock stress reliably reinstates heroin and cocaine seeking after prolonged drug-free periods. In the present paper, we summarize results from several studies on stress-induced reinstatement of heroin and cocaine seeking in rats. We first assess the degree to which the phenomenon of stress-induced relapse generalizes to other stressors, to behaviors controlled by other drugs of abuse, and to behaviors controlled by non-drug reinforcers. We then review evidence from studies concerned with the neurotransmitters, the brain sites, and the neural systems involved in stress-induced reinstatement of drug seeking. Finally, we consider the mechanisms that might underlie stress-induced relapse to drug seeking and the possible implications of the findings for the treatment of relapse to drug use in humans.

Linear black-box models, which have been commonly used for modeling flows, constitute the first approach. The second approach, a linear type in the context of our application, is less known in the water resources field and is identified by the term diffusion process. The third approach uses models called neural networks, which have gained interest in many fields. All these approaches were tested on 15 watersheds from the Saguenay - Lac-Saint-Jean hydrographic system, located in the province of Quebec, Canada. Because the watersheds possess different physical characteristics, the models were tested under several runoff conditions. In this article, the focus is on results; all approaches along with their conditions of use have been detailed elsewhere in the literature. The results obtained showed that neural networks constitute, for almost all the watersheds studied, the best approach to forecast daily natural flows. The more flexible structure of neural networks allows a best reproduction of complex runoff conditions. However, neural networks are more sensitive to outliers present in observed natural flow series, which are used as inputs in the three models tested. In practice, to model flows at specific periods of the year, it seems preferable to establish seasonal models. If a neural network has an inadequate structure for the period under consideration, then it may produce less convincing results than the other two modeling approaches tested in this study.

Methods: We used long-term cultures of spontaneously beating adult guinea-pig Ventricular cardiomyocytes developed and characterized previously in our laboratory. We assessed their contractile activity by video-recording as well as the underlying Ca transients by Fura 2 fluorescence. In some experiments we also recorded these functional parameters, plus the electrical activity (action potentials) in response to electrical stimulation via suction pipettes, in individual freshly isolated myocytes. Results: Exposure of the regularly and synchronously beating cultured cardiomyocytes to 100 mu M H2O2 initially caused a substantial prolongation of Ca-i(2+) transients accompanied by an irregular contractile activity, then in contractile arrest and a severalfold increase in cytosolic [Ca2+] that occurred, within 30 min of H2O2 application. Similar effects were also observed using freshly isolated cardiomyocytes. The latter effects were first accompanied by significant prolongation of the action potential duration (APD) with superimposed early afterdepolarizations followed by a second phase with a very fast decrease in APD, contractions, as well as Ca-i(2+) transients and a third phase of inexcitability, contractile arrest, increased cytoplasmic [Ca2+] and a final contracture. AU these effects were irreversible in both types of preparations but they could be fully prevented by a 15-min preincubation with 200 mu M SIH. Similar protective effects were observed with DFO, but in this case a much higher concentration had to be used (1 mM) and much longer (2 h) preincubation was needed. By contrast, 5 mu M MIA failed to fully protect the cardiomyocytes, although a significant delay (10 min) of the effects of H2O2 was observed. Conclusions: The data indicate that SIH provides a very powerful and very fast protection against the oxidative stress exerted by H2O2 presumably via the iron-mediated Fenton reaction producing hydroxyl radical ((OH)-O-.), whereas the protective effect of DFO is hindred by its very slow and rather limited intracellular entry, and the protection that MIA exerts via the inhibition of Na+/H+ exchange against H2O2 much less effective.

The goal of this study is to provide a better understanding of the role of the cortex in sleep's macro- and microstructure modulation. Methods: Sleep architecture and phasic events were investigated in 4 patients having undergone right functional or anatomical hemispherectomy and 8 control subjects. Between-groups differences were assessed using the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test. Results: Findings provide evidence for overall similarity between patients' and control subjects' left hemispheric sleep architecture. In addition, results clearly indicate that it is possible to detect electrical activity over the operated side of a hemispherectomized patient's brain, even when resection of the hemi-cortex has been complete. Finally, findings provide evidence for similar left and right hemispheric relative spectral activities and for an increase in fast activity bands over the intact hemisphere in anatomical hemispherectomized patients. Conclusions: This study provides evidence that right hemispherectomy does not produce significant sleep architecture alterations as recorded over the intact hemisphere. In addition, residual activity detected over the operated side in anatomical hemispherectomized patients is interpreted as resulting from volume conduction originating from generators located in the intact hemisphere. Finally, there is strong evidence for electrophysiological compensation in the intact hemisphere following complete resection of the contralateral hemi-cortex. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of upper and lower limb exertions on manifestations of upper limb global synkineses in hemiparetic subjects. Design: Involuntary muscle activities on the affected upper limb of 11 hemiparetic subjects and on the left or right upper limb of 10 control subjects were recorded using surface electromyography during successive bilateral maximal ankle exertions and during contralateral grips. Results: Significant differences in the level of involuntary electromyography (EMG) activities were observed between experimental conditions (ANOVAs, p < 0.05). EMG levels in hemiparetic subjects were significantly higher during contralateral grip tasks than during the ankle exertions. Conclusion: These results suggest that upper limb global synkineses are more prevalent in specific tasks and that this task specificity may reflect the neurophysiological mechanisms involved in the generation of global synkineses.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS- Fifteen elderly with distal neuropathy (DNP) and 15 healthy age-matched subjects were evaluated with the biomechanical variable COP-COM, which represents the distance between the center of pressure (COP) and the center of mass (COM). Measurements were taken in the quiet position with a double-leg stance, in eyes-open (EO) and eyes-closed (EC) conditions. Subjects were also assessed with clinical balance evaluations. RESULTS - The COP-COM variable was statistically significantly larger in the DNP group than in the healthy group in anterior-posterior (A/P) and medial-lateral (M/L) directions. Furthermore, the DNP group showed statistically significantly larger amplitudes of the COP-COM variable without vision. The severity of the neuropathy, as quantified using the Valk scoring system, was correlated with COP-COM amplitude in both directions. CONCLUSIONS - Evaluation of the postural stability of an elderly diabetic population using the COP-COM variable can detect a very small change in postural stability and could be helpful in identifying elderly with DNP at. risk of falling.

We have studied the involvement of intracellular calcium and calcium-dependent signaling in the NPY-induced CRF release in trophoblastic cells. The incubation of trophoblasts with NPY for 3 and 8 h led to a dose-dependent increase in CRF secretion. Also, NPY stimulated synthesis of this peptide hormone upon an 8-h incubation period. BIBP3226, a selective Y, receptor antagonist, and pertussis toxin (PTX) eliminated these effects. NPY-stimulated CRF secretion was mostly prevented by loading cells with BAPTA-AM, suggesting that elevation of intracellular calcium is responsible for the increase of CRF secretion. However, this calcium chelator had no effect on CRF synthesis. Furthermore, U-73122, a phospholipase C-beta s (PLC) inhibitor or xestospongin C, an inositol triphosphate receptor (InsP(3)-R) blocker, have partially prevented the effect of NPY on CRF synthesis and secretion. Therefore, the increase in CRF synthesis and secretion rely in part on the release of calcium from intracellular store. Interestingly, SKF 96365, an inhibitor of store operated calcium (SOC) influx, also partially blocked the NPY stimulatory effect on CRF release but not its synthesis, suggesting that calcium influx is also involved in this stimulation. In the syncytiotrophoblast, known to possess a NPY-activated protein kinase C (PKCs) activity, NPY also stimulated calcium calmodulin kinase II (CaMKII) and extracellular regulated kinase (ERK1/2) activities. In the present study, we observed that bisindolylmaleimide (BIM), a nonspecific PKCs inhibitor partially prevented the NPY-induced CRF release. On the other hand, autocamtide-2 related inhibitory peptide (AIP), a CaMKII inhibitor, prevented most of the stimulatory effect of NPY on both CRF synthesis and release. Go6976, an inhibitor of the conventional and mu PKCs and PD 098059, an inhibitor of the ERK cascade, had no effect on neither CRF synthesis nor release. Altogether, these results support a Y, receptor-mediated PTX-sensitive induction on CRF synthesis and release by NPY from human placental trophoblasts. The stimulation of CRF synthesis by NPY seems to depend mainly on a PLC-beta to InsP(3)-R axis and on CaMKII activity. Also, the release of CRF depends on the PLC-beta to InsP(3)-R axis and CaMKII activity but also entails the participation of a calcium-independent PKCs.

In the present study, we investigated the possibility that basal forebrain nitric oxide synthase (NOS)-containing neurons project to microvessels and NOS interneurons in the rat cerebral cortex. We performed quisqualic (QUIS) acid lesions of the basal forebrain and evaluated their effects on cortical NOS immunostained nerve terminals, with emphasis on those associated with microvessels and NOS interneurons, both at the light and/or electron microscopic levels. The results show that basal forebrain NOS neurons provide about one third of the overall cortical NOS innervation. Further, the data indicate that basalocortical NOS fibres establish privileged associations with microvessels and NOS neurons, as respective denervations of 60 and 45% were observed following lesion. At the electron microscopic level, most perivascular NOS neuronal elements corresponded to nerve terminals and a majority (similar to 25%) of these were located in the immediate vicinity of the blood vessels, similar to the perivascular distribution reported previously for classic neurotransmitters/neuromediators. NOS terminals abutting on cortical NOS neurons were primarily nonjunctional. Altogether, these results raise the possibility that not only cholinergic but also nitrergic basal forebrain neurons are involved in the flow response observed following stimulation of the basal forebrain. Further, they suggest interactions between basalocortical and intracortical NOS neurons. We conclude that these interactions are involved in the spatial and temporal regulation of cortical perfusion following basal forebrain activation, and that they may become dysfunctional in pathologies such as Alzheimer's disease which affects both the basal forebrain and the cortical NOS neurons.

We investigated whether high levels of PGs during the perinatal period assist in preserving neural function after such "stressful" hypoxic events. Visual evoked potentials (VEPs) and electroretinograms (ERGs) were recorded before and 45 min after mild moderate asphyxic hypoxia (two 4-min asphyxic-hypoxic periods induced by interrupting ventilation at 8-min intervals) in newborn piglets <12 h old treated or not treated with inhibitors of PG synthase (ibuprofen or diclofenac) with or without PG analogs. At 45 min after the hypoxic episode, P2 and b-wave amplitudes were slightly decreased and latencies were delayed. These changes in the VEP and ERG returned to near normal by 120 min. Ibuprofen and diclofenac decreased brain and retinal PG levels and markedly intensified 45 min after hypoxia-induced changes in VEP and ERG, but cerebral and retinal blood flows improved. Combined treatment with PG synthase inhibitor in combination with 16,16-dimethyl-PGE(2) (a PGE(2) analog), but not with PGI(2) and PGF(2 alpha) analogs, and in combination with the EP2 receptor agonist butaprost (but not EP1 or EP3 agonists), prevented ibuprofen- and diclofenac-aggravated postasphyxia electrophysiological changes. In conclusion, high levels of PGE(2) in nervous tissue, via actions on EP2 receptors, seem to contribute to preservation of neural function in the perinate subjected to frequent hypoxic events.

These tissues express various proteins that respond differently to androgens. Cathepsin A is a multifunctional lysosomal carboxypeptidase that also functions as a protective and an activator protein for neuraminidase and beta-galactosidase. In this study, cathepsin A was immunolocalized by light and electron microscopy using a polyclonal affinity-purified antibody on the testis and epididymis of normal, orchidectomized with or without testosterone supplementation, efferent duct-ligated, and hypophysectomized adult rats. In normal rats, cathepsin A expression was noted in lysosomes of Sertoli and Leydig cells but not in germ cells of the testis, as well as nonciliated cells of the efferent ducts. In the epididymis, a cell- and region-specific distribution of cathepsin A was noted. In experimentally treated animals, no changes were noted in the expression of cathepsin A. Immunolabeling of tissues examined at the electron microscopic level revealed that lysosomes were reactive. These data indicate cell- and region-specific expression of cathepsin A in cells of the testis and epididymis and also indicate that cathepsin A expression is not regulated by testicular or pituitary factors.

The level of phosphorylated elF4E, but not the level of total elF4E, was significantly correlated with the basal rate of translation measured from different animals. Serotonin (5-HT), a transmitter that regulates the rate of translation in Aplysia neurons, had mixed effects on elF4E phosphorylation. 5-HT decreased elF4E phosphorylation in sensory cell clusters through activation of protein kinase C. 5-HT increased elF4E phosphorylation in the whole pleural ganglia. In the Aplysia nervous system, elF4E phosphorylation correlated with phosphorylation of the p38 MAP kinase, but not the p42 MAP kinase (ERK). Furthermore, an inhibitor of the p38 MAP kinase significantly decreased basal elF4E phosphorylation, but an inhibitor of the MAP or ERK kinase (MEK) did not. Despite the correlation of elF4E phosphorylation with the basal rate of translation, inhibition of elF4E phosphorylation by an inhibitor of the p38 MAP kinase did not significantly decrease the rate of translation.

The distributions of glutamate receptors sensitive to amino-methylisoxazole-propionic acid (AMPA), to kainic acid (KA), and to N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) as well as metabotropic sites (MET1 and MET;?) were examined in wild type and Lurcher mice by quantitative autoradiography. This study was undertaken to determine the gene effect on the distribution of the various glutamate receptor subtypes, as well as how the cerebellar lesion affects the glutamatergic system in other brain regions. In cerebellum, there were postsynaptic AMPA and metabotropic receptors on Purkinje cells, postsynaptic NMDA receptors on granule cells, as well as KA receptors on granule cells or on parallel fibers. Taking into account surface areas, binding to all receptor subtypes was lower in the cerebellar cortex of Lurcher mutants than in wild type mice, while in the deep cerebellar nuclei only KA receptors were diminished. in other brain regions, the alterations followed always the same pattern characterized by a decrease of NMDA and KA receptors but with an increase of AMPA sites; these reciprocal changes were seen in thalamus, neostriatum, limbic regions, and motor cerebral cortical regions. Comparisons of glutamate receptor distribution in Lurcher mutants and in human autosomal cerebellar ataxia may permit further understanding of the role of glutamate-induced toxicity on neuronal death in these heredo-degenerative diseases.

J	Crammond, DJ; Kalaska, JF				Crammond, DJ; Kalaska, JF			Prior information in motor and premotor cortex: Activity during the delay period and effect on pre-movement activity	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article							PREPARATORY NEURONAL-ACTIVITY; PRIMATE FRONTAL-CORTEX; MONKEY PRIMARY MOTOR; REACHING MOVEMENTS; CORTICAL ACTIVITY; PARIETAL CORTEX; SENSORIMOTOR TRANSFORMATION; VISUOMOTOR ACTIVITY; INTENDED MOVEMENT; PREFRONTAL CORTEX	In instructed-delay (ID) tasks, instructional cues provide prior information about the nature of a movement to execute after a delay. Neuronal responses in dorsal premotor cortex (PMd) during the instructed-delay period (IDP) between the CUE and subsequent GO signals are presumed to reflect early planning stages initiated by the prior information. In contrast, in multiple-choice reaction-time (RT) tasks, all motor planning and execution processes must occur after the GO signal. These assumptions predict that neuronal planning correlates recorded during the IDP of ID trials should share common features with early post-GO activity in RT trials, and that those response components need not be recapitulated after the GO signal of ID trials. These two predictions were tested by comparing activity recorded in RT and ID tasks from 503 neurons in PMd and caudal (MIc) and rostral (MIr) primary motor cortex. The incidence and strength of directionally tuned IDP activity declined progressively from PMd to MIc. The directional tuning of activity during the IDP of ID trials was more similar to that in the reaction-time epoch (RTE) of RT trials than after movement onset, especially in PMd. A modulation of post-GO activity was often observed between RT and ID trials and was confined mainly to the RTE. This effect was also most prominent in PMd. The most common change was a reduction in intensity of short-latency phasic responses to the GO signal between RT and ID trials, especially in PMd cells with a short-latency phasic response to CUE signals. However, the largest group of cells in each area showed no large change in peak RTE activity between RT and ID trials, whether they were active in the IDP or not. Since early phasic CUE-related responses are least likely to be recapitulated after the GO signal in ID trials, they may be a neuronal correlate of an early planning stage such as response selection. Tonic IDP responses, which are not as strongly associated with a post-GO reduction in activity, may be related to other aspects of motor planning and preparation. Finally, a major component of the movement-related activity in both MI and PMd is not susceptible to modification by prior information and is indivisibly coupled temporally to movement execution.

J	Chery, N; De Koninck, Y				Chery, N; De Koninck, Y			GABA(B) receptors are the first target of released GABA at lamina I inhibitory synapses in the adult rat spinal cord	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article							DORSAL HORN; POSTSYNAPTIC POTENTIALS; HIPPOCAMPAL SLICES; SYNAPTIC VESICLES; PATCH-CLAMP; NEURONS; GLYCINE; ACID; INTERNEURONS; RESPONSES	We have previously provided functional evidence that glycine and GABA are contained in the same synaptic vesicles and coreleased at the same synapses in lamina I of the rat spinal dorsal horn. However, whereas both glycine receptors (GlyRs) and GABA(A) receptors (GABA(A)Rs) are expressed on the postsynaptic target, under certain conditions inhibitory events appeared to be mediated by GlyRs only. We therefore wanted to test whether GABA(B) receptors could be activated in conditions where GABA released was insufficient to activate GABA(A)Rs. Focal stimulation in the vicinity of visually identified lamina I neurons elicited monosynaptic IPSCs in the presence of ionotropic glutamate receptor antagonists. Pairs of stimuli were given at different interstimulus intervals (ISI), ranging from 25 ms to 1 s to study the depression of the second of evoked IPSCs (paired pulse depression; PPD). Maximal PPD of IPSCs was 60 +/- 14% (SE) (of the conditioning pulse amplitude), at ISI between 150 and 200 ms. PPD was observed with IPSCs evoked at stimulus intensities where they had no GABA(A)R component. PPD of small evoked IPSCs was not affected by the GABA(A)R antagonist bicuculline but significantly attenuated by 10-30 mu M CGP52432, a specific GABA(B) receptor antagonist. These data indicate that, under conditions where GABA released is insufficient to affect postsynaptic GABA(A)Rs at lamina I inhibitory synapses, significant activation of presynaptic GABA(B) receptors can occur.

Maintained reciprocal thalamocortical connectivity was demonstrated by VB stimulation, which elicited orthodromic and antidromic responses in the cortex, along with re-entry of thalamocortical firing originating in VB neurons excited by cortical output activity. In addition, orthodromic responses were recorded in VB and RTN following stimuli delivered in the cortex. Spontaneous and stimulus-induced coherent rhythmic oscillations (duration = 0.4-3.5 s; frequency = 9-16 Hz) occurred in cortex, VB, and RTN during application of medium containing low concentrations of the K+ channel blocker 4-aminopyridine (0.5-1 mu M). This activity, which resembled electroencephalograph (EEG) spindles recorded in vivo, disappeared in both cortex and thalamus during application of the excitatory amino acid receptor antagonist kynurenic acid in VB (n = 6). By contrast, cortical application of kynurenic acid (n = 4) abolished spindle-like oscillations at this site, but not those recorded in VB, where their frequency was higher than under control conditions. Our findings demonstrate the preservation of reciprocally interconnected cortical and thalamic neuron networks that generate thalamocortical spindle-like oscillations in an in vitro rat brain slice. As shown in intact animals, these oscillations originate in the thalamus where they are presumably caused by interactions between RTN and VB neurons. We propose that this preparation may help to analyze thalamocortical synchronization and to understand the physiopathogenesis of absence attacks.

Rice, K. Wexler, & P. Cleave, 1995; K. Wexler, 1994) is evident in both learner groups and to what extent cross-learner similarities exist. We analyzed spontaneous production data from French-speaking children with SLI, English-speaking L2 learners of French, and French-speaking controls, all approximately 7 years old. We examined the children's use of tense morphology, temporal adverbials, agreement morphology, and distributional contingencies associated with Finiteness. Our findings indicate that the use of morphosyntax by children with SLI and by L2 children has significant similarities, although certain specific differences exist. Both the children with SLI and the L2 children demonstrate optional infinitive effects in their language use. These results have theoretical and clinical relevance. First, they suggest that the characterization of the optional infinitive phenomenon in normal development as a consequence of very early neurological change may be too restrictive. Our data appear to indicate that the mechanism underlying the optional infinitive phenomenon extends to normal (second) language learning after the primary acquisition years. Second, they indicate that tense-marking difficulty may not be an adequate clinical marker of SLI when comparing children with impairment to both monolingual and bilingual peers. A more specific clinical marker would be more effective in diagnosing disordered populations in a multilingual context.

Homozygous em bryos exhibit an open neural tube from the caudal midbrain to the tip of the tail that results from over-differentiation of the floor plate. To facilitate the positional cloning of the Lp gene, both cDNB selection and assignment of sequence-tagged-sites from the human transcript map have been used to identify genes within the Lp interval. Together with previous physical mapping, this has allowed the placement of 13 transcription units within an approximately 1-Mb region that spans the Lp genetic interval, and eight of these genes map to the nonrecombinant interval. This map includes genes that encode proteins involved in protein sorting and targeting (Tim23 and Copa), ion transport (Atp1a2, Atp1a4, and Girk3), transcription (Nhlh1), immune regulation (Cd48 and Fcer1 alpha). cell adhesion (R88252), apoptosis (Pea15), and several of unknown function (H326, Kiaa0253, and Estm34). Expression analysis by Northern blotting indicated that a subset of these genes are expressed preferentially in the developing nervous system. Finally this region of mouse Chr 1 represents a conserved linkage group with genes on human chromosome 1q21, a region that is frequently altered in human cancers and that harbors loci for several genetic conditions. Consequently, analysis of the Lp interval may provide important tools to understand how the corresponding region of human Chr 1 contributes to disease, in addition to defining a key gene product required for neurulation.

The human PREB gene encodes a predicted protein of 417 amino acids, exhibiting several sequences characteristic of the WD-motif protein family. PREB transcripts were detected in every human fetal and adult tissue examined, although a great variation in levels of expression was observed. PREB was mapped to human Chromosome 2p23, a region of the genome associated with partial trisomy 2p syndrome. Although variable, the common duplication phenotype includes facial abnormalities, skeletal defects, growth and mental retardation, congenital heart and neural tube defects, and abnormalities of the genitalia. We propose that PREB has a role during human development and that abnormal dosage of this transcription factor may be involved in some of the developmental abnormalities observed in patients with partial trisomy 2p.

This RARE is required for the initiation and maintenance of Hoxd4 transgene expression in neurectoderm, and for full anteriorized expression upon retinoic acid (RA) treatment. Mutations within the sequence TTTTCTG, located 2 bp downstream of the RARE, posteriorized transgene activity. However, the onset of transgene expression and its response to RA were indistinguishable from wild type. While the TTTTCTG motif resembles a CDX binding site, human CDX1 protein did not interact with this element in vitro. Three additional regions were also shown to control transgene expression in neurectoderm, establishing that multiple elements constitute the Hoxd4 neural enhancer.

We describe a novel endogenous isoform of mStau (termed mStau(i)) which has an insertion of six amino acids within dsRBD3, the major double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-binding domain. with a structural change of the RNA-binding domain, this conserved and widely distributed isoform showed strongly impaired dsRNA-binding ability. In transfected cells, mStau(i) exhibited the same tubulovesicular distribution (RER) as mStau when weakly expressed; however, when overexpressed, mStau(i) was found in large cytoplasmic granules. Markers of the RER colocalized with mStau(i)-containing granules, showing that overexpressed mStau(i) could stiff be associated with the RER. Cotransfection of mStau(i) with mStau relocalized overexpressed mStau(i) to the reticular RER, suggesting that they can form a complex on the RER and that a balance between these isoforms is important to achieve proper localization. Coimmunoprecipitation demonstrated that the two mStau isoforms are components of the same complex in vivo. Analysis of the immunoprecipitates showed that mStau is a component of an RNA-protein complex and that the association with mStau(i) drastically reduces the RNA content of the complex. We propose that this new isoform, by forming a multiple-isoform complex, regulates the amount of RNA in mStau complexes in mammalian cells.

It may be the preferred substrate for transport via the reduced-folate carrier (RFC). We isolated a cDNA for the reduced folate carrier (RFC-1) from human skin fibroblasts, A common polymorphism at position 80 in exon 2 of RFC-1 was identified. This polymorphism changes a guanine (G) to an adenine (A), abolishing a CfoI restriction site. Using genomic DNA samples from 169 healthy subjects, we identified 27.1% GG homozygotes, 21.9% AA homozygotes, and 50.9% GA heterozygotes. We explored the impact of this polymorphism, separately and in combination with the 677C->T polymorphism in the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase gene, on folate status and total homocysteine levels. We found a moderate, but significant, increase in total homocysteine levels in doubly homozygous 80GG/677TT subjects as compared to 80GG/677CC (P = 0.01) or 80GG/677CT (P = 0.04) subjects. In addition, individuals who mere 80AA/677CT had higher plasma folate levels than those who were 80GG/677CT (P = 0.02). (C) 2000 Academic Press.

Three microphthalmia/anophthalmia loci have been identified(1-3), and two others have been inferred by the co-segregation of translocations with the phenotype(4,5). We previously found that mice with ocular retardation (the or-J allele), a microphthalmia phenotype(6), have a null mutation in the retinal homeobox gene Chx10 (refs 7,8). We report here the mapping of a human microphthalmia locus on chromosome 14q24.3, the cloning of CHX10 at this locus and the identification of recessive CHX10 mutations in two families with nonsyndromic microphthalmia (MIM 251600), cataracts and severe abnormalities of the iris. In affected individuals, a highly conserved arginine residue in the DNA-recognition helix of the homeodomain is replaced by glutamine or proline (R200Q and R200P, respectively). Identification of the CHX10 consensus DNA-binding sequence (TAATTAGC) allowed us to demonstrate that both mutations severely disrupt CHX10 function. Human CHX10 is expressed in progenitor cells of the developing neuroretina and in the inner nuclear layer of the mature retina. The strong conservation in vertebrates of the CHX10 sequence, pattern of expression and loss-of-function phenotypes demonstrates the evolutionary importance of the genetic network through which this gene regulates eye development.

J	Schwenk, H; Bengio, Y				Schwenk, H; Bengio, Y			Boosting neural networks	NEURAL COMPUTATION			English	Article							ALGORITHMS	Boosting is a general method for improving the performance of learning algorithms. A recently proposed boosting algorithm, AdaBoost, has been applied with great success to several benchmark machine learning problems using mainly decision trees as base classifiers. In this article we investigate whether AdaBoost also works as well with neural networks, and we discuss the advantages and drawbacks of different versions of the AdaBoost algorithm. In particular, we compare training methods based on sampling the training set and weighting the cost function. The results suggest that random resampling of the training data is not the main explanation of the success of the improvements brought by AdaBoost. This is in contrast to bagging, which directly aims at reducing variance and for which random resampling is essential to obtain the reduction in generalization error. Our system achieves about 1.4% error on a data set of on-line handwritten digits from more than 200 writers. A boosted multilayer network achieved 1.5% error on the UCI letters and 8.1% error on the UCI satellite data set, which is significantly better than boosted decision trees.

L. Williamson et al. (1998, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 95, 9631-9636) showed that disease caused by expression of mutant Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1) in mice was slowed down by disruption of the neurofilament light (NF-L) gene. This led to the conclusion that decreasing the axonal amount of neurofilaments reduces the vulnerability of motor neurons to toxicity mediated by mutant SOD1. We report here that, unexpectedly, overexpression of human NF-L proteins resulting in extra axonal neurofilaments does not shorten the life span of transgenic mice expressing a mutant SOD1 (SOD1(G37R)). Microscopic examination of spinal cord and ventral roots even shows modest protective effects of NF-L overexpression. These results suggest that axonal neurofilaments are not an exacerbating factor in motor neuron disease mediated by mutant SOD1 and that perikaryal neurofilaments may even have beneficial effects.

In particular, the effects of ammonia may be responsible for the reduced astrocytic uptake of neuronally-released glutamate and high extracellular glutamate levels consistently seen in experimental models of hepatic encephalopathy. To further address this issue, [H-3]-D-aspartate uptake was examined in primary rat cortical astrocyte cultures exposed to 5 mM ammonium chloride for a period of 7 days. In addition, reverse transcrirptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blot studies were performed to examine the mRNA and protein expression respectively of the glutamate transporter CLAST in ammonia-treated cells. Studies revealed a 57% (p < 0.05) decrease in [H-3]-D-aspartate uptake and a concomitant significant decrease in GLAST transporter protein (43%, p < 0.05) and mRNA (32%, p < 0.05) expression. The reduced capacity of astrocytes to reuptake glutamate following ammonia exposure may result in compromised neuron-astrocyte trafficking of glutamate and could thus contribute to the pathogenesis of the cerebral dysfunction characteristic of hyperammonemic syndromes such as hepatic encephalopathy.

TrkB stimulated signaling proteins and induced survival and growth in a manner similar to TrkA. TrkB mutated at the Shc binding site supported survival and growth poorly relative to wild-type TrkB, whereas TrkB mutated at the PLC-gamma 1 binding site supported growth and survival well. TrkB-mediated neuronal survival was dependent on PI3-kinase and to a lesser extent MEK activity, while growth depended upon both MEK and PI3-kinase activities. These results indicate that the TrkB-Shc site mediates both neuronal survival and axonal outgrowth by activating the PI3-kinase and MEK signaling pathways.

Two-hybrid analyses were used to identify proteins involved in p75NTR apoptotic signaling, and a p75NTR binding partner termed NRAGE (for (n) under bar eurotrophin (r) under bar eceptor-interacting M (A) under bar (G) under bar (E) under bar homolog) was identified. NRAGE binds p75NTR in vitro and in vivo, and NRAGE associates with the plasma membrane when NGF is bound to p75NTR. NRAGE blocks the physical association of p75NTR with TrkA, and, conversely, TrkA overexpression eliminates NRAGE-mediated NGF-dependent death, indicating that interactions of NRAGE or TrkA with p75NTR are functionally and physically exclusive. NRAGE over-expression facilitates cell cycle arrest and permits NGF-dependent apoptosis within sympathetic neuron precursors cells. Our results show that NRAGE contributes to p75NTR-dependent cell death and suggest novel functions for MAGE family proteins.

Rats were trained to self-administer cocaine (0.5 mg/kg/infusion, i.v; 10-12 days) and, after a drug-free period (7-13 days), were returned to the self-administration chambers for daily extinction and reinstatement test sessions. Both intermittent footshock (15 min, 0.6 IIIA) and cocaine priming (20 mg/kg, i.p.) reinstated extinguished drug seeking. Pretreatment with either clonidine (20, or 40 mu g/kg, i.p.) or lofexidine (50, 100, 150, or 200 mu g/kg, i.p.) attenuated footshock- but not cocaine-induced reinstatement of cocaine seeking. Guanabenz (640 mu g/kg, ip) an alpha-2 agonist with low affinity for imidazoline type-1 receptors, also attenuated footshock- but but not cocaine-induced reinstatement of cocaine seeking.

Segmental analysis, following pulse labeling with H-3-leucine into the vitreous body, was used to detect changes in fast anterograde transport in the optic nerve and tract. Single injections of ACR significantly reduced the quantity of radiolabeled proteins transported in both transgenic (lacking NF) and non-transgenic (containing NF] mice by 68.4% and 46.2%, respectively. Similarly, single injections of a,5-hexanedione (2,5-HD) reduced the quantity of radiolabeled transport in transgenic and non-transgenic mice by 55.2% and 47.1%, respectively. Equimolar doses of propionamide and 3,4-hexanedione (non-neurotoxic analogues of ACR and 2,5-HD, respectively) produced no changes in the quantity or apparent rate of optic nerve transport Additionally, no differences in quantity or apparent rate of transport between transgenic and non-transgenic animals were observed under control or experimental conditions. Therefore, ACR and 2,5- HD reduce the quantity of fast anterograde axonal transport in mouse CNS axons in a comparable amount to previously reported reductions in rat PNS axons. The absence of axonal neurofilaments had no effect on normal fast transport. Furthermore, the presence or absence of neurofilaments did not alter the effect of these toxicants on fast axonal transport. We conclude that toxicant-induced reductions in fast axonal transport are unrelated to ACR and g-diketone effects on NF or their accumulation. (C) 2000 Inter Press, Inc.

We report 12 term children with PVL to delineate its long-term clinical correlates, A retrospective review of a standardized computer database and files of a single pediatric neurologist during a 7-year period was performed. The imaging studies were reviewed independently by two neuroradiologists, The mean age of the patients at the initial neurologic assessment was 24.4 months (range 5-60); nine were males. The reason for the assessment was developmental delay in 10 (83.3%), seizure in one, and attention-deficit-hyperactivity disorder in one, Three children (25 %) had normal motor examinations, three (25%) were hypotonic, three (25%) had spastic diplegia, two (16.7%) had spastic quadriplegia, and one (8.3%) had fine-motor abnormalities. Nine children (75%) had developmental delay (severe global delay in six), and two children (16.7%) had epilepsy; electroencephalograms were abnormal in six (50%), PVL was mild in five (41.7%), moderate in two (16.6%), and severe in five (41.7%) children. Pour of eight children with global developmental delay had enlargement of cerebral sulci in addition to white matter changes. PVL in term children presents with a spectrum of neurologic abnormalities, particularly developmental delay and heterogeneous motor findings not limited to classic spastic diplegia, The clinician should consider the diagnosis of PVL in the context of term children with developmental delay and motor abnormalities, even in the absence of perinatal difficulties.

J	Flores, C; Stewart, J				Flores, C; Stewart, J			Basic fibroblast growth factor as a mediator of the effects of glutamate in the development of long-lasting sensitization to stimulant drugs: studies in the rat	PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Review						bFGF; bFGF-2; amphetamine; sensitization; glutamate; dopamine; neurotrophic factor; stimulant drug; astrocytes	VENTRAL TEGMENTAL AREA; MESOLIMBIC DOPAMINE SYSTEM; RECEPTOR MESSENGER-RNA; FREELY MOVING RATS; AMPHETAMINE BEHAVIORAL SENSITIZATION; SIGNAL-TRANSDUCTION CASCADE; EXCITATORY AMINO-ACIDS; MPTP-TREATED MICE; NEURONS IN-VIVO; PREFRONTAL CORTEX	Rationale: Repeated exposure to stimulant drugs, such as the indirect dopaminergic agonists amphetamine or cocaine, results in increased sensitivity to their effects on behavior and dopaminergic function. Neuroadaptations initiated in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), a cell body region of midbrain dopaminergic neurons, and dependent on glutamatergic transmission, underlie the development of this persistent drug-induced sensitization. How precisely drug actions in the VTA initiate long-lasting changes in dopaminergic function, and how glutamate participates in these events is not clear. Objective: To discuss the idea that neurotrophic, neuroprotective factors are involved. Results: We review the few studies that have been concerned with a role for neurotrophic factors in the changing response to stimulant drugs and present a summary of those conducted in our laboratory on basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), a neurotrophic factor produced by astrocytes. Conclusion: We argue that repeated exposure to stimulant drugs increases the demands on dopaminergic cell functioning, and, by stimulating glutamate release, recruits neurotrophic and neuroprotective substances such as bFGF. We propose that the actions of these factors, in turn, give rise to long-lasting neuronal adaptations that underlie sensitized responding to further drug exposure. Possible mechanisms whereby bFGF participates in the development of sensitization, including interactions with other neurotrophic factors, are discussed. In addition, we show how the evidence reviewed in this paper provides further support for the idea that repeated treatment with stimulant drugs induces synaptic plasticity.

Methods-We conducted a prospective study of 304 subjects, including 82 with a recent (less than or equal to 7 days) transient ischemic attack (TIA), 157 asymptomatic individuals with a cervical bruit, and 65 control subjects. Baseline evaluation included a neurological assessment, EGG, cervical ultrasonography, and cerebral CT and/or MRI. Levels of maskers of coagulation and fibrinolytic activity were also determined. Results were analyzed in relation to the degree of carotid disease and the subsequent occurrence of cerebral and cardiac ischemic events. Results-Over a mean follow-up period of 2.8 years (SD, 1.3 years), 114 ischemic events occurred. Survival analyses showed that prothrombin fragment 1.2 (F-1.2) was a predictor of time to cerebral and cardiac ischemic events in the combined TIA and asymptomatic bruit group (relative risk [RR], 1.46; 95% CT, 1.18 to 1.81) as well as in the asymptomatic bruit group separately (RR, 1.70; 95% CI, 1.14 to 2.53). In the TIA group, both F-1.2 (RR, 3.36; 95% CI, 1.19 to 4.68) and severe (greater than or equal to 80%) carotid stenosis (RR, 3.53; 95% CI, 1.19 to 10.51) were predictive of time to ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction, or vascular death. Conclusions-In patients with TIAs and in asymptomatic individuals with cervical bruits, F-1.2 levels were found to be independent predictors of subsequent cerebral and cardiac ischemic events, Our results are consistent with an active role of the coagulation system through upregulation of thrombin in carotid disease progression and in the pathogenesis of ischemic events in patients at risk.

It seems that psychosocial factors play an important role in the delay in returning to gainful employment but that chronic postoperative lumbar and lower extremity pain is blamed for this state of affairs. The present series of late outcomes is based on actual physical examination by independent neurosurgical and orthopedic experts appointed by the Workman's Compensation Board, providing an impartial opinion as to the discrepancy between objective findings and failure to reintegrate into the work force. METHODS One thousand workmen's compensation patients who had undergone lumbar spinal. surgery were divided into two groups, one of 600 patients with single operations, evaluated on average 51 months after surgery, and the second of 400 with multiple operations, evaluated on average 38 months postoperatively. RESULTS Seventy-one percent of the single operation group had not returned to work more than 4 years after the operation, and 95% of the multiple operations group. In none of these cases was there a neurological deficit that precluded gainful employment, the failure to return to work being blamed on chronic postoperative pain. CONCLUSIONS Although motivational (that is, psychosocial) factors undoubtedly play a role in failure to return to work, the role of chronic pain cannot be ignored. Increased attention must be devoted to ascertaining the etiology of this pain and ways to prevent it. (C) 2000 by Elsevier Science Inc.

The radioactivity concentration in a region-of-interest is consequently altered by loss of signal from that structure and contamination from adjacent brain regions, phenomena known as partial volume effects. We now apply an MRI-based algorithm to compensate for partial volume effects in the special case of compartmental modeling of the cerebral uptake of 6-[F-18]fluoro-L-dopa (FDOPA), an exogenous substrate of dopa decarboxylase. High-resolution MRI scans were obtained from normal volunteers (n = 4) and patients with Parkinson's disease(n = 4) in order to segment specific brain regions and calculate the partial volume correction factors, Dynamic 2D PET scans were acquired during 90 min following intravenous infusion of FDOPA. After partial volume correction, the apparent net blood- brain clearance of FDOPA (K-i) was greatly increased in caudate and putamen of normal subjects and in caudate of Parkinson's disease patients. The equilibrium distribution volume of FDOPA (V-e(D)) in cerebral cortex increased by 35% in all subjects. Using a two-compartment model, the relative activity of dopa decarboxylase with respect to FDOPA (k(3)(D)) in the basal ganglia was increased 2-3 times in normal subjects, to the range obtained previously in brain of living rat. The partial volume correction also increased the magnitude of k(3)(D) in caudate of Parkinson's disease patients, but did not alter k(3)(D) in putamen. A three-compartment model correcting for elimination of decarboxylated metabolites also yielded higher estimates of k(3)(D), but with a penalty in precision of the estimates. Together, these observations suggest that the limited spatial resolution of PET results in substantial underestimation of the true rate of FDOPA uptake and metabolism in vivo, and may also tend to obscure regional heterogeneity in the neurochemical pathology of Parkinson's disease.

We investigated the expression of glutamate receptor subtypes in cortical and subcortical brain regions following bilateral olfactory bulbectomy in adult rats. Quantitative receptor autoradiography using [I-125]MK-801 (NMDA receptor), [H-3]AMPA (AMPA receptor), and [H-3]kainate (kainate receptor) was performed on brain sections at 1-5 weeks following olfactory bulbectomy. Our results show an elevation of NMDA receptors in the medial prefrontal cortex within 1 week following bulbectomy, which persisted up to at least 5 weeks post-bulbectomy. Neither kainate nor AMPA receptors were altered in any brain region examined. The potential significance of these results is discussed in light of experimental findings supporting a role for NMDA receptors in the mechanism of action of antidepressant drugs and the pathophysiology of major depression.

J	Miasnikov, AA; Dykes, RW				Miasnikov, AA; Dykes, RW			The design and application of three speaker-based stimulating devices for cutaneous stimulation in anesthetized and awake animals	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						neural plasticity; sensory surface; whisker; air-puff; hydraulic pulse; microiontophoresis	BARREL CORTEX; ADULT; REPRESENTATION; MONKEYS; RATS; MAPS	Those wishing to study neuronal plasticity in sensory systems are confronted by the need to deliver equivalent stimuli to the organism at time intervals separated by hours, days or months. This problem is particularly acute in the somatosensory system where delivering all equivalent stimulus generally requires a second physical contact with the same point on a geometrically complex surface. This requirement is difficult to fulfill. We have designed two stimulators that avoid or minimize the importance of this requirement by obviating the need for the stimulator to be at a fixed distance from the skin. As well, we have redesigned a system for whisker stimulation originally proposed by Simons. The first stimulator is appropriate for experiments in anesthetized animals; the surface to be stimulated is immersed in water warmed to body temperature and the tactile stimulus is generated as an hydraulic pulse. The second uses a high velocity pulse of air shaped so that it can be transmitted significant distances without attenuation. The redesign of the Simons' vibrissa stimulator provides larger amplitude displacements and lower controlling voltages more readily generated by equipment normally found in laboratories. We also described the design of a chamber for restricting the awake rat during chronic study and the electrodes used for recording and for delivery of drugs in awake animals held in such a chamber.

Although repeat length and age at disease onset are inversely related, similar to 50% of the age at onset variance in SCA2 remains unexplained. Other familial factors have been proposed to account for at least part of this remaining variance in the polyglutamine disorders. The ability of polyglutamine tracts to interact with each other, as well as the presence of intranuclear inclusions in other polyglutamine disorders, led us to hypothesize that other GAG-containing proteins may interact with expanded ataxin-2 and affect the rate of protein accumulation, and thus influence age at onset, To test this hypothesis, we used step-wise multiple linear regression to examine 10 CAG-containing genes for possible influences on SCA2 age at onset. One locus, RAI1, contributed an additional 4.1% of the variance in SCA2 age at onset after accounting for the effect of the SCA2 expanded repeat. This locus was further studied in SCA3/Machado-Joseph disease (MJD), but did not have an effect on SCA3/MJD age at onset. This result implicates RAI1 as a possible contributor to SCA2 neurodegeneration and raises the possibility that other CAG-containing proteins may play a role in the pathogenesis of other polyglutamine disorders.

The present investigation measured changes in regional cerebral blood flow with positron emission tomography in normal human subjects who were instructed to commit to memory abstract visual patterns. The results indicated that the rostral orbitofrontal region (area 11). which is primarily linked with the anterior medial temporal limbic region and lateral prefrontal cortical areas, is involved in the process of encoding of new information.

J	Beaulieu, JM; Jacomy, H; Julien, JP				Beaulieu, JM; Jacomy, H; Julien, JP			Formation of intermediate filament protein aggregates with disparate effects in two transgenic mouse models lacking the neurofilament light subunit	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						neurofilament; peripherin; intermediate filament; transgenic mouse; ALS; amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; motor neuron disease; neurodegeneration	AMYOTROPHIC-LATERAL-SCLEROSIS; MOTOR-NEURON DISEASE; NF-H; ALPHA-INTERNEXIN; NERVOUS-SYSTEM; RADIAL GROWTH; MICE; PERIPHERIN; EXPRESSION; MUTANT	Protein aggregates containing intermediate filaments (IFs) are a hallmark of degenerating spinal motor neurons in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Recently, we reported that a deficiency in neurofilament light subunit (NF-L), a phenomenon associated with ALS, promoted the formation of IF inclusions with ensuing motor neuron death in transgenic mice overproducing peripherin, a type III IF protein detected in axonal inclusions of ALS patients. To further assess the role of NF-L in the formation of abnormal IF inclusions, we generated transgenic mice overexpressing human neurofilament heavy subunits (hNF-H) in a context of targeted disruption of the NF-L gene (hH; L-/- mice). The hH; L-/- mice exhibited motor dysfunction, and they developed nonfilamentous protein aggregates containing NF-H and peripherin proteins in the perikarya of spinal motor neurons. However, the perikaryal protein aggregates in the hH; L-/- mice did not provoke motor neuron death, unlike toxic IF inclusions induced by peripherin overexpression in NF-L null mice (Per; L-/- mice). Our results indicate that different types of IF protein aggregates with distinct properties may occur in a context of NF-L deficiency and that an axonal localization of such aggregates may be an important factor of toxicity.

We report here that the levels of several matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are also elevated following a corticectomy trauma injury to the mouse CNS. The delayed upregulation of MMPs compared to that for IL-1 suggests the possibility that inflammatory cytokines regulate MMP production in CNS trauma. To resolve this, we developed a method to isolate and maintain highly enriched human fetal neurons or astrocytes in culture and examined the regulation by cytokines of the activity of a subgroup of MMPs, the gelatinases (MMP-2 and -9). While both neuronal and astrocytic cultures displayed comparable MMP-2 activity, as evidenced by gelatin zymography, levels of MMP-9 were proportionately higher in neurons compared to astrocytes, Of a variety of cytokines and growth factors tested in vitro, only IL-1 beta was effective in increasing the neuronal expression of MMP-9. Finally, an IL-1 receptor antagonist attenuated the increase of neuronal MMP-9 in culture and abolished the injury-induced increase of MMP-9 in the mouse brain. These results implicate IL-1 beta as a key regulator of neuronal MMP-9 in culture and of the elevation of MMP-9 that occurs following mouse CNS trauma. (C) 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

SNC80 (30, 100, 200, 400 nmol, i.c.v.) and deltorphin II (3, 15, 30, 60 nmol, i.c.v.) induced similar, dose-dependent biphasic locomotor effects in non-habituated subjects. An initial decrease in exploratory activity was associated with anxiogenic signs such as pile-erection, freezing behaviour and pupil dilation for each drug. Pre-treatment with the 6 antagonist naltrindole (10 nmol, i.c.v.) inhibited the depressant effect, but not the subsequent stimulant effect, on locomotor activity in response to 30 nmol deltorphin II in this assay (P<0.05). In habituated rats, deltorphin II (0.03, 0.1, 0.3, 3 nmol, i.c.v.) caused significant, naltrindole-reversible increases in locomotor activity (P<0.05 for all doses) at 1000-fold lower doses than those required for a similar response to SNC80 (10, 30, 100, 300 nmol, i.c.v.). Pharmacokinetic studies suggest that these compounds penetrate the brain to similar extents following i.c.v. injection. The substantial potency difference between deltorphin II and SNC80 in stimulating locomotor activity in habituated rats suggests pharmacological heterogeneity for these delta opioid receptor agonists.

We stimulated the left primary motor cortex (MI) of eight healthy volunteers during rest, observation of handwriting and observation of arm movements. Motor evoked potentials (MEP) were recorded from the first dorsal intereosseous (FDI) and biceps (BIC) muscles. Our results showed that action observation induced a facilitation of the MEP amplitude evoked by the single test stimulus and reduced intracortical inhibition and facilitation at 3 ms and 12 ms interstimulus intervals (ISIs), respectively, during paired-pulse stimulation. These changes were specific for the muscle involved in the observed action. Our study presents further evidence that motor excitability is significantly modified when the subject observes an action performed by another individual.

Here, we show that p73 is primarily present in developing neurons as a truncated isoform whose levels are dramatically decreased when sympathetic neurons apoptose after nerve growth factor (NGF) withdrawal. Increased expression of truncated p73 rescues these neurons from apoptosis induced by NCF withdrawal or p53 overexpression. In p73-/- mice, all isoforms of p73 are deleted and the apoptosis of developing sympathetic neurons is greatly enhanced. Thus, truncated p73 is an essential anti-apoptotic protein in neurons, serving to counteract the pro-apoptotic function of p53.

This analogue possesses high affinity and selectivity for the kappa opioid receptor (K-i(kappa) = 2.7 nM, K-i ratio kappa/mu/delta = 1/2116/3260). The gain in selectivity is achieved through an overall reduction of opioid receptor affinity which is most pronounced at mu and delta receptors. The Pro(3) analogue exhibits antagonist properties. Despite its high kappa affinity, [Pro(3)]Dyn A(1-11)-NH2 is a relatively weak antagonist in both the [S-35]GTP(gamma)S assay (IC50 = 380 nM) and the guinea pig ileum assay (K-e = 244 nM). Discrepancies between GPI and binding assay have often been ascribed to differential kappa receptor subtypes prevailing in central vs peripheral neurons. Since the [S-35]GTP gamma S assay uses the same membrane preparations as the binding assay, differential kappa subtypes can be ruled out as an explanation in this case, and the observed behavior rather seems to reflect an intrinsic property of the ligand.

The fluorescence completely formed after tau was incubated in phosphate buffer and Tris-HCl buffer for approximately 20 h, with a relaxation phase about 2-4 h. The light scattering of the sample solution improved during formation of the fluorescence when tau was incubated. Both the fluorescence and tau oligomers did not form when tau was incubated in the buffers containing DTT. On the other hand, heparin improved both tau aggregation and the fluorescence formation. It suggests that the fluorescence comes from tau polymerization, which may follow the mechanism of tyrosine-tyrosinate emission for a protein not containing any tryptophan residues. This new fluorescence could be used as a probe to tau polymers. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

This study's purpose was to determine the associations between quality of life and performance based assessments of disablements in community dwelling individuals post-stroke. Methods: Forty five people were evaluated in a cross-sectional pilot study. The subjects' quality of life (SF-36), ability in basic and instrumental activities of daily living (ADL), manual dexterity, mobility, neurological impairment, and perception of Lateral neglect were evaluated. Multiple regression was employed to find the strongest associations. Results: Neurological impairment explained 34% of the variation in the women's physical health summary score (PCS) of the SF-36. Instrumental ADL and neurological impairment together explained 66% of the women's mental health summary score (MCS) of the SF-36. Manual dexterity of the hemiplegic hand explained 39% of the variation in the men's PCS. Conclusion: Performance based measures may be useful to estimate quality of life in non-communicative individuals.

Animals were trained to discriminate ethanol (0.8 g/kg, i.p.) from saline using 11 consecutive cycles consisting of a pairing day and three nonpairing days. On pairing days, all animals were injected with ethanol 30 min prior to a 20-min limited access to a saccharin solution (0.1% w/v) and then immediately injected with either LiCl (0.15 M, 1.8 meq) or distilled water. On the three following nonpairing days, animals were injected with saline and 30 min later presented with the same saccharin solution for 20 min. No injections followed on these nonpairing days. Results showed that animals acquired discriminative stimulus control for ethanol after seven pairings. Pretreatment with the catalase inhibitor did not alter the discriminative control for ethanol. Generalization tests revealed that acetaldehyde substituted for ethanol at a dose of 0.3 g/kg. The results of the present study suggest that catalase inhibition did not reverse or alter the discriminative stimulus effects of ethanol. However, generalization rests showed that acetaldehyde (0.3 g/kg) will substitute for ethanol suggesting that these two drugs share some similar properties. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Inc.

Cold fluid (40 ml/kg, 4 degrees C) was given intravenously over 30 min to decrease core temperature (Tc) in eight younger (age 18-23) and eight older (age 55-71) individuals. Compared with younger subjects, the older subjects had significantly lower Tc thresholds for vasoconstriction (35.5 +/- 0.3 vs. 36.2 +/- 0.2 degrees C, P = 0.03), heat production (35.2 +/- 0.4 vs. 35.9 +/- 0.1 degrees C, P = 0.04), and plasma norepinephrine (NE) responses (35.0 vs. 36.0 degrees C, P < 0.05). Despite a lower Tc nadir during cooling, the maximum intensities of the vasoconstriction (P = 0.03) and heat production (P = 0.006) responses were less in the older compared with the younger subjects, whereas subjective thermal comfort scores were similar. Plasma NE concentrations increased fourfold in the younger but only twofold in the older subjects at maximal Tc cooling. The vasomotor response for a given change in plasma NE concentration was decreased in the older group (P = 0.01). In summary, aging is associated with 1) a decreased Tc threshold and maximum response intensity for vasoconstriction, total body oxygen consumption, and NE release, 2) decreased vasomotor responsiveness to NE, and 3) decreased subjective sensory thermal perception.

The study stemmed from an earlier epidemiological survey of North American Hutterite colonies (1950-1953), in which a low prevalence of psychoses was documented. Method: Psychiatrically ill individuals identified during the previous survey were rediagnosed with DSM-IV criteria. A current provincial health insurance claims database was queried anonymously for the period June 1992-May 1997, and the prevalence rate of disease among Hutterites, identified by distinctive surnames and unique postal addresses, was compared with the rate in the entire population of the province of Manitoba and in a comparison group of persons with Hutterite surnames but with addresses outside the Hutterite colonies. Results: The annual prevalence of schizophrenia among the communal Hutterites, estimated from the database search by using ICD-9 criteria, was consistent with the prevalence found in the prior epidemiological survey (annual mean of 1.2/1,000 population, compared with 1.3/1,000 in the prior survey). The database search yielded a significantly lower prevalence for schizophrenia and other functional psychoses among communal Hutterites as well as among the comparison group, compared to the total Manitoba population. There was also lower prevalence for affective psychoses and adjustment reaction disorders among the communal Hutterites, compared to the total Manitoba population. Rates for neurotic disorders were elevated both among the communal Hutterites and the comparison group. Conclusions: The prevalence of specific psychoses was reduced among the Hutterites, although neurotic disorders were more prevalent. These findings suggest some specificity, although possible artifacts such as ascertainment bias must be considered. Further research is needed to examine genetic and environmental factors that may contribute to reduced prevalence of specific psychoses among the Hutterites.

We report on 12 kindreds with familial perisylvian polymicrogyria (FPP) presenting at 10 centers, examine the clinical presentation in these familial cases, and propose a possible mode of inheritance. The clinical and radiological pattern was variable among the 42 patients, with clinical differences among the families and even within members of the same family. Pseudobulbar signs, cognitive deficits, epilepsy, and perisylvian abnormalities on imaging studies were Mot found in all patients. When present, they displayed a spectrum of severity. The only clear correlation in this study was between bilateral imaging findings and abnormal tongue movements and/or pronounced dysarthria. Most of the families provided evidence suggestive of, or compatible with, X-linked transmission. On the other hand, the pedigrees of 2 families ruled out X-linked inheritance. The most likely mode of inheritance for these 2 families was autosomal dominant with decreased penetrance; however, autosomal recessive inheritance with pseudodominance could not be ruled out in 1 family. We conclude that FPP appears to be genetically heterogeneous. However, most of the families probably represent a third previously undescribed X-linked syndrome of cortical maldevelopment.

J	Chakrabarti, SK; Bai, CJ				Chakrabarti, SK; Bai, CJ			Effects of protein-deficient nutrition during rat pregnancy and development on developmental hindlimb crossing due to methylmercury intoxication	ARCHIVES OF TOXICOLOGY			English	Article						methylmercury; pre- and postnatal protein malnutrition; hindlimb crossing; protein synthesis	GROWTH; BRAIN; PHOSPHORYLATION; UNDERNUTRITION; CHILDREN; PLASMA; SWINE; DIET	Pregnant rats were fed either a control (20% protein) or low (3.5%) protein diet during gestation and lactation. The pups were separated from their mothers on postnatal day 21, and were given the same diet as their corresponding mothers. The groups of pups from each diet group were treated on either postnatal day 21 or postnatal day 60 with 7.5 mg methylmercury chloride (MeHgCl) per kg b.w. once daily by gavage for 10 consecutive days, and the development of ataxia (hindlimb crossing) was monitored. The offspring from mothers on the protein-deficient diet were found to be more sensitive to MeHg-induced ataxia than those on the protein-sufficient diet. The former accumulated more mercury in different brain regions than the latter. The rates of protein synthesis in different brain regions of the offspring fed the protein-deficient diet were significantly reduced compared with the rates in those fed the protein-sufficient diet. However, MeHg treatment did not significantly modify the rates of such protein synthesis further in protein-deficient rats. Thus, a significantly much higher inhibition of the intrinsic rates of protein synthesis in different brain regions due to severe protein deficiency, as observed in this study, may be partly responsible for the increased susceptibility of developing rats fed a protein-deficient diet to MeHg-induced a taxia, or hindlimb crossing, although other factor(s) might also be involved.

Phenacetin, acetaminophen and dipyrone attenuated the pain response, beginning at 50. 50 and 100 mg/kg, respectively. Systemically active drugs produced weaker antinociception when injected into the paw or intracerebroventricularly at doses approximately10(3) lower than those required for systemic effects; dose effect relations were bell-shaped by the intracerebroventricular route. By all three routes, there was a clear ceiling to the effects of acetaminophen that is consistent with its clinical efficacy. systemic phenacetin and acetaminophen produced a conditioned place preference at doses that produced antinociception. Dipyrone produced a place aversion by the systemic route and a place preference intracerebroventricularly. The latter had a bell-shaped dose effect relationship identical to that in the formalin test. Indomethacin was inactive in all tests, except for mild hyperalgesia by the intraventricular route. The results indicate that the antinociceptive effects of phenacetin, acetaminophen and dipyrone reflect a combination of peripheral and central actions, neither of which involves inhibition of cyclooxygenase. The central component of the antinociceptive effects may be related to activation of brain mechanisms that are involved in reinforcement. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Therefore, assessments for ADHD need to be comprehensive and should involve multiple domains, informants, methods, and settings. Thus, evaluation of various biological conditions, functional disorders, developmental status, situational, environmental, and family problems should all be explored. Since there is no diagnostically definitive test for ADHD, the clinical interview of the child and family is one of the cornerstones of the assessment process. A comprehensive medical history and examination, psyche-educational tests, school-related evaluations, and the child's social and emotional functioning are also crucial, however. Recent developments of tests of executive functioning neuroimaging, and genetics may provide more exact diagnostic guidelines in the future.

These cells send major neurites to the kidney and at least some of them were shown to innervate the renal pore closer muscle, and thereby control its function. By using in-situ hybridization and immunofluorescence, the presence of L5-67 and LUQ-1 mRNAs and peptides was studied in the kidney, with emphasis on the region of the renal pore. We detected immunoreactive materials in many small varicose nerve fibers running along the central epithelium in the inner parts of the kidney, and in neurites located within a large nerve associated with muscles inside the renal pore. Our observations represent the first direct evidence of the presence of gene products from LUQ cells at the renal pore, suggesting that they may be responsible for mediating LUQ cell signals. Furthermore, mRNAs coding for the L5-67 and LUQ-1 peptides were also found in the nerve structure inside the renal pole. Our report documents a striking example of neuropeptide mRNA targeting nerve terminals that are very distant from their cell bodies. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

We report our findings on the use of [H-3]17 beta-estradiol (E-2) to identify intracellular estrogen receptors (ERs) in the hypothalamus of juvenile rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss. Specific binding (B-SP) of [H-3]E-2 was tissue dependent between 0.5 and 2.25 hypothalamus equivalents for cytosol and nuclear extract preparations, respectively. B-SP in cytosol fractions increased with time and reached maximum levels (4.18 nM) at 2.5 h incubation; by contrast, B-SP in nuclear extract increased with time to achieve maximum levels (3.9 nM) by 2 h incubation. The association rate constants (k(+1)) for cytosol and nuclear extract preparations were 1.10 +/- 0.02 x 10(8) M-1 min(-1) and 1.27 +/- 0.04 x 10(8) M-1 min(-1), respectively. Equilibrium bound B-SP dissociated from cytosol preparations with a half life (t(1/2)) of 42 min and a dissociation rate constant (k(-1)) of 1.01 +/- 0.03 min(-1). B-SP dissociated from nuclear extract preparations with a t(1/2) = 45 min and k(-1) = 0.92 +/- 0.01 min(-1). B-SP was saturable in both extract preparations with a calculated equilibrium dissociation constant (K-d) of 1.46 +/- 0.1 nM (cytosol) and 2.37 +/- 0.2 nM (nuclear), and a maximum number of binding sites (B-MAX) of 50.85 +/- 3.2 fmol mg(-1) protein and 61.74 +/- 2.65 fmol mg(-1) protein, respectively. In both preparations, B-SP was differentially displaced by structurally similar compounds with a rank order of potency of E-2 > estrone > estriol > 17 alpha-ethynyl estradiol > testosterone >> progesterone = tamoxifen >> cortisol > dexamethasone >> > beta-sitosterol. These properties of specifically bound [H-3]E-2 suggest the presence of an ER in the hypothalamus of juvenile rainbow trout comparable with ERs identified in salmonid liver.

Data Sources: Published original work, review articles, scientific abstracts and books, as well as our personal files. Study Selection: Studies were selected for their relevance to the applications of nonlinear complex systems, to critical care medicine, and to the concepts presented. Data Extraction: We extracted all applicable data. Data Synthesis: Following a brief review of MODS, an introduction to complex nonlinear systems is presented, including clear concepts, definitions, and properties. By examining the multiple, nonlinear, interrelated, and variable interactions between the metabolic, neural, endocrine, immune, and inflammatory systems; data regarding interconnected antibody networks; and the redundant, nonlinear, interdependent nature of the inflammatory response, we present the hypothesis that the systemic host response to trauma, shock, or sepsis must be evaluated as a complex nonlinear system. This model provides a new explanation for the failure of trials using various antimediator therapies in the treatment of patients with sepsis and MODS. Understanding the host response as a complex nonlinear system offers innovative means of studying critical care patients, specifically by suggesting a greater focus on systemic properties. We hypothesize that analysis of variability and connectivity of individual variables offer a novel means of evaluating and differentiating the systemic properties of a complex nonlinear system. current applications of evaluating variability and connectivity are discussed, and insights regarding future research are offered. Conclusion: The paradigm offered by the study of complex nonlinear systems suggests new insights to pursue research to evaluate, monitor, and treat patients with MOBS.

The goal of this study was to compare the primary sequence motifs of bovine PC1 and PC2 with those of homologs from other mammalian species to establish the structural basis for PC1 and PC2 activities in bovine that resemble other mammalian homologs. Molecular cloning from bovine adrenal medulla resulted in the isolation of cDNAs for bovine PC1 and PC2 with highly conserved primary sequences with respect to signal sequence, prosegment, catalytic domain, and P domain. Bovine PC1 and PC2 contained the catalytic triad residues Asp, His, Ser, which are identical to the triads in PC1 and PC2 from other mammalian species. Bovine PC1 contained Asn as the oxyanion hole residue; in contrast, bovine PC2 contained Asp as the oxyanion hole residue, which is identical to PC2 in other mammalian species. Bovine PC1 and PC2 possessed the P domain that contains the functional RRGDL motif, The cloned cDNAs detected expression of PC1 and PC2 mRNAs in bovine adrenal medulla, These results establish the defined structural domains of bovine PC1 and PC2 that are known to be essential for the activities of these enzymes in various species.

We prepared, characterized, and assessed polycaprolactone-b-polyethylenoxyde (PCL-b-PEO) micelles containing PK506 in vitro and in vivo. By using well-established animal model of peripheral nerve injury (crushed sciatic nerve), we show that the rate of Functional recovery of injured nerve is significantly enhanced in rats treated with micellar FK506. These findings support the notion that PCL-b-PEO is a suitable polymer material for FK506 and suggest its wider applicability as a delivery vehicle for other biologically active, poorly soluble therapeutic agents.

Patients and Methods: Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (H-1-MRSI) was used to measure NAA/Cr in temporal lobes of eight patients with newly diagnosed epilepsy before or soon after starting medication. Six patients had follow-up H-1-MRSI examinations 7 months later. Clinical pattern of the seizures and the EEG findings suggested partial seizures in all and TLE in five patients. None of the patients had lesional epilepsy according to magnetic resonance imaging. Results: Initial H-1-MRSI of the temporal lobes showed significantly low NAA/Cr values in five of eight patients. Five of six patients who had follow-up H-1-MRSI were seizure-free after using medication; the remaining patient did not take medication and continued to experience occasional auras. Wilcoxon rank sign comparison of NAA/Cr on initial H-1-MRSI examination and follow-up H-1-MRSIs showed no significant difference (Z = 135, p = 0.893, 2-tailed) for five seizure-free patients. Conclusions: Neuronal dysfunction is present at an early stage of the epileptic process. NAA/Cr recovery in seizure-free patients controlled with antiepileptic drugs is less evident, compared with successful surgical treatment. Thus, absence of seizures is not necessarily coupled with NAA/Cr improvement and observed variable response warrants further investigation.

Methods: For lateralization analysis, we used data from 150 nonforeign tissue lesional TLE patients [88 left-sided (L-TLE), 46 right-sided (R-TLE)], and 16 bilateral (Bi-TLE)I. For the discrimination of TLE from E-TLE, we used data from 174 patients (145 with unilateral TLE, 14 with unilateral E-TLE, and 15 with widespread epileptogenic zones involving both the TL and extra-TL regions-multilobar epilepsy). A series of "leave-one-out" cross-validated linear discriminant analyses were performed using the MRVol and H-1-MRSI data sets to lateralize TLE and discriminate it from E-TLE. Results: Lateralization: The leave-one-out linear discriminant analyses were able to correctly lateralize (with a posterior probability >0.50) 120 (90%) of the 134 L-TLE and R-TLE patients. Imposing higher posterior probability (>0.95) increased accuracy of lateralization to 98%, with only two discordant cases who underwent surgery on the side of electroencephalogram, and both had bad outcome. Discrimination: the leave-one-out linear discriminant analyses were able to correctly classify (with a posterior probability >0.50) 142 (89%) of the 159 TLE and E-TLE patients. Accuracy increased slightly as higher posterior probability cutoffs were imposed, with fewer patients being classified. Conclusions: Pattern analysis of H-1-MRSI and MRVol data can accurately lateralize TLE. Discriminating TLE from E-TLE was less accurate, probably due to the presence of temporal lobe damage in some patients with E-TLE reflecting dual pathology.

J	Petrides, M				Petrides, M			The role of the mid-dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in working memory	EXPERIMENTAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Workshop on Executive Control and the Frontal Lobe	DEC 01-03, 1998	HANSE INST ADV STUDY, DELMENHORST, GERMANY		HANSE INST ADV STUDY		DELAYED-RESPONSE PERFORMANCE; GRANULAR FRONTAL-CORTEX; RHESUS-MONKEY; UNIT-ACTIVITY; ASSOCIATION CORTEX; AFFERENT INPUT; LESIONS; PRIMATE; CONNECTIONS; ALTERNATION	Recent studies with nonhuman primates have shown that lesions of the mid-dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, which extends from the lip of the dorsal bank of the sulcus principalis to the midline (i.e., dorsal area 46 and 9/46 and area 9), give rise to severe and long-lasting impairments on self-ordered and externally ordered tasks designed to tax executive processing within working memory, rather than short-term memory per se. Lesions limited to area 9 give rise to a mild impairment on these tasks. Thus, the mid-dorsolateral prefrontal region has been shown to be critical for the monitoring of multiple events in working memory. The mid-dorsolateral prefrontal region receives visuospatial input from the posterior dorsolateral region (areas 8 and 6) and from the cortex within the middle part (sulcal area 46) and the caudal part (area 8) of the sulcus principalis. Nonspatial visual input originates from the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex. Thus, lesions focused on the middle to caudal part of the sulcus principalis would affect visuospatial input, but would not affect the flow of nonspatial visual object information that reaches the mid-dorsolateral prefrontal region from the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex. Lesions of the sulcus principalis produce a spatially selective impairment, whereas lesions of the mid-dorsolateral prefrontal region produce a more general impairment of the monitoring and manipulation of information in working memory. The results of recent functional neuroimaging studies with human subjects are consistent with the above findings from work with the monkey.

Using this database, we have previously reported on the relationship between behavioural variables and the probability of blood-flow response in distinct subdivisions of the ACC. The goal of the current analysis was to discover which areas of the frontal cortex show increased blood-flow co-occurring consistently with increased blood-flow in the ACC. Analyses of the frequency distributions of peaks in the ACC and the remaining frontal cortex (FC) yielded several important findings. First, FC peaks in the precentral gyrus, superior frontal gyrus, middle frontal gyrus, inferior frontal gy rus, medial frontal gyrus and orbitomedial frontal gyri were more frequent in subtractions that also yielded a peak in the ACC than in those that did not yield an ACC peak. Second, regional differences in the frequency distribution of these FC peaks were observed when the ACC peaks were subdivided into the rostral versus caudal ACC and supracallosal versus subcallosal ACC. Peaks in the precentral gyrus and in the vicinity of the supplementary motor area were more prevalent in subtractions with co-occurring peaks in the caudal than with the rostral ACC. Peaks in the middle frontal gyrus were more frequent in subtractions with co-occurring peaks in the paralimbic part of the supracallosal ACC, relative to the subcallosal or limbic supracallosal ACC. These observations are consistent with known differences in the anatomic connectivity in these cortical regions, as defined in non-human primates. Further analyses of the influence of behavioural variables on the relationships between the ACC and other regions of the frontal cortex suggested that this type of meta-analysis may provide testable hypotheses about functional and effective connectivity within the human frontal lobe.

CGRP caused a concentration-dependent increase in short circuit current (I-sc, EC50 21 nM), which was abolished in chloride-free buffer but was not blocked by CGRP(8-37) or tetrodotoxin (TTX). Amylin and adrenomedullin caused only a modest increase in I-sc. The responses to the linear CGRP(2) receptor agonists [Cys(Et)(2,7)] hCGRP alpha and [Cys(Acm)(2,7)] hCGRP alpha were considerably smaller than the response to CGRP. These responses were abolished in chloride-free buffer and were TTX sensitive. Atropine, doxantrazole, and indomethacin did not block the effects of CGRP or the CGRP, agonists. The response to [Cys(Et)(2,7)] hCGRP alpha was not affected by prior desensitization of the CGRP receptor and vice versa, Inflamed rats had a similar secretory response to CGRP (I-sc, EC50 15 nM) and [Cys(Et)(2,7)] hCGRP alpha as control tissues, while being hyporesponsive to carbachol, CGRP application increased electrical conductance of inflamed preparations. Taken together, these data suggest that CGRP may play an important role in the maintenance of host defense in colitis through an apparently novel CGRP receptor located on the colonic enterocyte.

The method relies on the sequence-specific extension of two immobilized allele-specific primers that differ at their 3'-nucleotide defining the alleles, by a reverse transcriptase (RT) enzyme at optimized reaction conditions. We show the potential of this simple one-step procedure performed on spotted primer arrays of low redundancy by generating over 8000 genotypes for 40 mutations or SNPs. The genotypes formed three easily identifiable clusters and all known genotypes were assigned correctly. Higher degrees of multiplexing will be possible with this system as the power of discrimination between genotypes remained unaltered in the presence of over 100 amplicons in a single reaction. The enzyme-assisted reaction provides highly specific allele distinction, evidenced by its ability to detect minority sequence variants present in 5% of a sample at multiple sites. The assay format based on miniaturized reaction chambers at standard 384-well spacing on microscope slides carrying arrays with two primers per SNP for 80 samples results in low consumption of reagents and makes parallel analysis of a large number of samples convenient. In the assay one or two fluorescent nucleotide analogs are used as labels, and thus the genotyping results can be interpreted with presently available array scanners and software. The general accessibility, simple set-up, and the robust procedure of the array-based genotyping system described here will offer an easy way to increase the throughput of SNP typing in any molecular biology laboratory.

The primary effect is geometrical distortion in the phase encoding direction. In this paper, we present a method based on the conjugate gradient algorithm to correct for this geometrical distortion, by solving the EPI imaging equation. Two versions are presented: one that attempts to solve the full four-dimensional (4-D) imaging equation, and one that independently solves for each profile along the blip encoding direction. Results are presented for both phantom and in vivo brain EPI images and compared with other proposed correction methods.

These same structures are also affected in Alzheimer's Disease. Therefore, based on our previous intra-cerebral findings, our present research was to use our novel Memory Workload Paradigm in conjunction with surface ERPs as neurophysiological markers to tap cerebral regions and functions involved in memory disorders pertaining to early Alzheimer's Disease as opposed to normal memory processes in age-matched normal control subjects. Moreover, the Mangina-Test which measures varying degrees of 'Analytical-Specific Visual Perception' was individually administered to all patients and controls in separate sessions. Results indicate that for the early Alzheimer's Disease group, a significant main effect for memory load was found for the P400 amplitude (F-3,F-30 = 4.52, P < 0.02) which was absent in the normal group. In particular, the P400 amplitude was significantly higher on posterior head regions for patients with early Alzheimer's Disease as opposed to age-matched normal subjects (F-7,F-140 = 3.54, P < 0.03) which distinguished both groups (F-1,F-20 = 6.13, P < 0.03). For the P400 latency, a significant memory load effect was present only for the normal group (F-3,F-30 = 11.26, P < 0.01). The Mangina-Test performance clearly differentiated both groups (F-1,F-19 = 105.85, P < 0.001). The present data provide the first valuable evidence that ERPs to our novel Memory Workload Paradigm are sensitive neurophysiological diagnostic markers which delineate the early clinical brain irregularities underlying early Alzheimer's Disease as opposed to the normal memory processes of age-matched normal subjects. In addition, their use could be valuable for the objective clinical follow-up of therapeutic interventions in early Alzheimer's Disease. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

As a direct consequence, this condition opens the way to delinquency, school drop-out, depression, suicide, substance abuse, work absenteeism, and other psyche-social complications. In this paper, we are presenting a selective overview of our previous research and its clinical applications in this field as it relates to our present research data pertaining to the effects of our original Memory Workload Paradigm on the event-related brain potentials in differentiating normal and pathological pre-adolescents (learning disabled/ADHD with concomitant severe behavioral disorders such as oppositional and conduct). In addition, it provides data on the bilateral electrodermal activity during cognitive workload and Mangina-Test performance of pathological and normal pre-adolescents conducted in separate sessions. The results of our present research indicate that a significant memory load effect for the P450 latency (F-3,F-27 = 4.98, P < 0.01) and the P450 amplitude (F-3,F-27 = 3.57, P < 0.05) was present for normal pre-adolescents which was absent in pathological pre-adolescents. Moreover, enhanced N450 ERP amplitudes to our Memory Workload Paradigm in pre-frontal and frontal regions clearly differentiated normal From pathological pre-adolescents (F-1,F-18 = 12.21, P < 0.004). Furthermore, significant differences between normal and pathological groups were found in bilateral electrodermal activity (F-1,F-18 =23.86, P < 0.001) and on the Mangina-Test performance (F-1,F-18 = 75.35, P < 0.001). Our present research findings provide an original and valuable demonstration of an integrative and effective clinical psychophysiological application of central (ERPs), autonomic (bilateral electrodermal activity) and neuro-psychometric aspects (Mangina-Test) which characterize normal and pathological pre-adolescents and underpin the neurophysiological basis of learning disabled/ADHD with severe behavioral disorders as opposed to normal subjects.

J	Loyka, SL; Mosig, JR				Loyka, SL; Mosig, JR			New behavioral-level simulation technique for RF/microwave applications. Part II: Approximation of nonlinear transfer functions	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RF AND MICROWAVE COMPUTER-AIDED ENGINEERING			English	Article						behavioral-level simulation; nonlinear transfer function; approximation	ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORKS; DESIGN INVITED ARTICLE; GENETIC ALGORITHM; CIRCUITS; ELECTROMAGNETICS	The instantaneous quadrature technique is an efficient tool for nonlinear behavioral-level simulation of RF / microwave circuits or systems over wide frequency and dynamic ranges. in order to obtain accurate simulation results, accurate approximation / representation of the nonlinear transfer functions (or factors) as well as accurate measurement (or circuit-level simulation) of the amplitude (AM-AM) and phase (AM-PM) nonlinearities are required. In this paper, we consider how to approximate these transfer functions (factors) using splines, orthogonal and nonorthogonal series expansions, and evolutionary programming techniques (genetic algorithm and neural networks) with viewpoint of the simulation accuracy. The influence of AM-AM and AM-PM measurement (or simulation) inaccuracy and noise on the entire simulation accuracy is also discussed. Series expansion methods are proposed as a tool to filter out the measurement noise. (C) 2000 John Wiley & Sons. Inc.

In this paper, we have studied the connection of this area with the trigeminal motor nucleus and with pools of last-order interneurons of the lateral brainstem. Retrograde tracing techniques were used in combination with immunohistochemistry to define populations of glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons. Injections of tracer into the Vth motor nucleus marked, neurons in several trigeminal nuclei including the ipsilateral mesencephalic nucleus, the contralateral Vth motor nucleus, the dorsal cap of the main sensory nucleus and the rostral divisions of the spinal nucleus bilaterally. Many last-order interneurons formed a bilateral lateral band running caudally from Regio h (the zone surrounding the Vth motor nucleus), through the parvocellular reticular formation and Vth spinal caudal nucleus. Injections of tracer into Regio h, an area rich in last-order interneurons, marked, in addition to the areas listed above, a large number of neurons in the medial reticular formation bilaterally. The major difference between injection sites was that most neurons projecting to the Vth motor nucleus were located laterally, whereas most of those projecting to Regio h were found medially. Both populations contained glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons intermingled. Our results indicate that neurons of the medial reticular formation that are active during mastication influence Vth motoneurons output via relays in Regio h and other adjacent nuclei.

The granulin/epithelin precursor supports tumorigenesis in appropriate cell models and is the only growth factor able to overcome the cell cycle block that occurs in murine fibroblasts after deletion of a functional IGF-1 receptor. However, little is known of the role of granulin/epithelin gene products in vivo. To understand the physiological role of granulins it is essential to know the cell types and conditions in which it is expressed. We examined granulin/epithelin gene expression in adult rodents by in situ hybridization. The granulin/epithelin precursor is constitutively expressed in a number of epithelia, particularly in the skin, GI tract, and reproductive system. Other epithelia express the gene less strongly. Progranulin is expressed in immune cells in vivo and in specific neurons in the brain, including Purkinje cells, pyramidal cells of the hippocampus, and some cerebral cortical neurons. Little expression was detected in muscle cell, connective tissue, or endothelium. Cumulatively, these results define the basal gene expression of a new growth factor system a nd suggest that the progranulin/epithelin gene is multifunctional, with important constitutive roles in epithelial homeostasis, reproductive, immunological, and neuronal function.

TrkA stimulation up-regulates the expression of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members, Bcl-2, Bcl-X-I, and Bfl-1.

We apply this method to develop a steady-state signal equation for MT-weighted spoiled gradient echo sequences and consider approximations that facilitate its rapid computation. Using this equation, we assess various experimental designs for quantitatively imaging the fractional size of the restricted pool, cross-relaxation rate, and T-1 and T-2 relaxation times of the two pools in a binary spin bath system. From experiments on agar gel, this method is shown to reliably and accurately estimate the exchange and relaxation properties of a material in an imaging context, suggesting the feasibility of using this technique in vivo.

To demonstrate directly that E2F1 modulates neuronal apoptosis, we used cultured cortical neurons to show a temporal association of the transcription and expression of E2F1 in neurons with increased neuronal apoptosis. Cortical neurons lacking E2F1 expression (derived from E2F1 -/- mice) were resistant to staurosporine-induced apoptosis as evidenced by the significantly lower caspase 3-like activity and a lesser number of cells with apoptotic morphology in comparison with cortical cultures derived from wild-type mice. Furthermore, overexpressing E2F1 alone using replication-deficient recombinant adenovirus was sufficient to cause neuronal cell death by apoptosis, as evidenced by the appearance of hallmarks of apoptosis, such as the threefold increase in caspase 9-like activity and increased laddered DNA fragmentation, in situ end-labeled DNA fragmentation, and numbers of neuronal cells with punctate nuclei. Taken together, we conclude that E2F1 plays a key role in modulating neuronal apoptosis.

These pathways can be modulated by Ras guanyl nucleotide exchange factors (Ras GEFs), which activate Ras protein by catalyzing the exchange of GDP for GTP. RasGRP, a recently discovered Ras GEF is expressed in brain as well as in T cells. In addition to the catalytic domain which catalyzes dissociation of Ras-GDP, RasGRP has a pair of calcium-binding EF hands and a diacylglycerol binding domain. The structure of RasGRP suggests that it serves to link calcium and lipid messengers to Ras signaling pathways. We have used an RNase protection assay to detect RasGRP mRNA in various regions of the rat brain and we have determined the cellular distribution of RasGRP mRNA by in situ hybridization. RasGRP mRNA is widely distributed and is present in both interneurons and projection neurons but not confined to any neuronal type or neurotransmitter phenotype. The presence of RasGRP mRNA in archicortical neurons suggests that this pathway may be important in phylogenetically older regions of the CNS. The restriction of RasGRP mRNA to subsets of neurons suggests that activation of Ras by RasGRP has a specific function in certain neuronal types. We did not detect RasGRP in glial cells.

However, whereas direction-related activity has been well documented by neurophysiological studies in many motor structures including the dorsal premotor cortex (PMd), there is much less concensus about the prominence and timing of amplitude-related premotor activity. We studied this issue using an instructed-delay task in which prior information about target location (direction and distance) must be memorized before movement initiation. The results show that prior information about distance is reflected in PMd activity during the delay period well before movement initiation, and begins to be expressed as early as 150 ms after presentation of target location. The prominence of neural correlates with direction is relatively constant throughout the trial, but distance correlates become gradually more prominent with time, both during and after the delay period. A small majority of cells were modulated only by direction during the delay period, but very few were modulated only by distance, and most of the rest were modulated by both. Therefore PMd neurons usually process information about distance only in conjunction with directional information. These results do not support a separate neuronal substrate for distance in PMd, but do not preclude its existence elsewhere. The results also support a progressive change in the nature of the movement-related representation in PMd with time in an instructed-delay paradigm.

Under current clamp, voltage responses to hyperpolarizing current pulses featured depolarizing sags that were abolished by the I-H blocker ZD 7288. Under voltage clamp, subtraction of current responses to hyperpolarizing steps recorded in the absence and presence of ZD 7288 was used to investigate the properties of I-H. Current-voltage analysis revealed that steady-state I-H amplitude increases with hyperpolarization, with half-maximal activation of the underlying conductance occurring at -78 mV. The time course of activation of I-H during hyperpolarizing steps was monoexponential with time constants (100-800 msec) decreasing with hyperpolarization. The effects of ZD 7288 on I-H were slow (tau, similar to 15 min), irreversible, and half-maximal at 1.8 mu M. When tested on continuously active MNCs, application of 30-60 mu M ZD 7288 caused a significant reduction in firing rate. In phasically active MNCs, the drug decreased burst duration and intraburst firing frequency and caused an increase in the duration of interburst intervals. These effects were accompanied with a small hyperpolarization of the membrane potential. In contrast, ZD 7288 had no effect on spike duration, on the amplitude of calcium-dependent afterpotentials, or on the frequencies and amplitudes of spontaneous synaptic potentials. These results confirm the presence of I-H in MNCs of the rat supraoptic nucleus and suggest that the presence of this conductance provides an excitatory drive that contributes to phasic and tonic firing.

Here we show, by immunofluorescent staining with antibodies generated against Xenopus laevis integrins, that alpha 3 beta 1 integrin is concentrated at the active zones of Xenopus motor nerve terminals. Because integrins can link extracellular matrix molecules to cytoskeletal elements and participate in the formation of signaling complexes, the localization of integrin at active zones suggests that it may play a role in the adhesion of the nerve terminals to the synaptic basal lamina, in the formation and maintenance of active zones, and in some of the events associated with calcium-dependent exocytosis of neurotransmitter. Our findings also indicate that the integrin composition of the terminal Schwann cells differs from that of the motor nerve terminals, and this may account at least in part for differences in their adhesiveness to the synaptic basal lamina.

In spinal rats, this network, known as central pattern generator (CPG), was shown to be sensitive to serotonergic pharmacological stimulation. In previous works we have shown that embryonic raphe cells transplanted into the sublesional cord of adult rats can reinnervate specific targets, restore the lesion-induced increase in receptor densities of neurotransmitters, promote hindlimb weight support, and trigger a locomotor activity on a treadmill without any other pharmacological treatment or training. With the aim of discriminating whether the action of serotonin on CPG is associated to a specific level of the cord, we have transplanted embryonic raphe cells at two different levels of the sublesional cord (T9 and T11) and then performed analysis of the kinematic and EMG activity synchronously recorded during locomotion. Locomotor performances were correlated to the reinnervated level of the cord and compared to that of intact and transected nontransplanted animals. The movements expressed by T11 transplanted animals correspond to a well defined locomotor pattern comparable to that of the intact animals. On the contrary, T9 transplanted animals developed limited and disorganized movements as those of nontransplanted animals. The correlation of the locomotor performances with the level of reinnervation of the spinal cord suggests that serotonergic reinnervation of the L1-L2 level constitutes a key element in the genesis of this locomotor rhythmic activity. This is the first in vivo demonstration that transplanted embryonic raphe cells reinnervating a specific level of the cord activate a locomotor behavior.

Methods: a Ser9Gly polymorphism in codon 9 of the DRD3 and a VNTR polymorphism in the DAT1genes were examined in two groups of schizophrenic patients, one of excellent neuroleptic responders (N = 42) and one of nonresponders (N = 64). A. group of healthy volunteers screened for major psychiatric disorders was also included (N = 89). In addition, age at onset of psychotic symptoms, attention performance and family loading for schizophrenia spectrum disorders were compared between patients with different genotypes in the DRD3 and DAT1 genes. Results: No significant differences in the allelic distribution of the DRD3 and DAT1 polymorphisms were detected between schizophrenic patients and controls. A trend toward an excess of DRD3 genotype Gly/Gly was observed in neuroleptic nonresponder schizophrenic patients compared to controls (chi (2) = 3.30, df = 1, p = 0.07). No significant differences in age at onset of psychotic symptoms, attention task performance or family loading for schizophrenia spectrum disorders were observed between groups with different DRD3 and DAT1 genotypes. Conclusion: These results do not support the role of either of these genes in increasing susceptibility to schizophrenia or in modulating its phenotype in the studied population.

The pituitary pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) gene is a target for factors of both families. Indeed, pituitary-specific transcription of POMC depends on the action of the homeodomain-containing transcription factor Pitx1 and of bHLH heterodimers containing NeuroD1. We now show lineage-restricted expression of NeuroD1 in pituitary corticotroph cells and a direct physical interaction between bHLH heterodimers and Pitx1 that results in transcriptional synergism. The interaction between the bHLH and homeodomains is restricted to ubiquitous (class A) bHLH and to the Pitx subfamily. Since bHLH heterodimers interact with Pitx factors through their ubiquitous moiety, this mechanism may be implicated in other developmental processes involving bHLH factors, such as neurogenesis and myogenesis.

Ca2+ enters cells across epical plasma membranes along a steep electrochemical gradient, through Ca2+ channels. Regulation by various hormones implies several steps, including binding of these hormones to the basolateral membrane, interaction with G proteins, liberation of messengers, activation of kinases and finally opening of the channels at the opposite pole of the cells. In the present study, we examined whether the Ca2+ entry through the luminal membranes of proximal and distal tubules is also regulated by G proteins, by a membrane-limited process. Luminal membranes were purified from rabbit proximal and distal tubule suspensions, and their vesicles were loaded with GTP gamma s or the carrier. Then, the Ca-45(2+) uptake by these membrane vesicles was measured in the presence and absence of 100 mM NaCl. In the absence of Na+, intravesicular GTP gamma s significantly enhanced 0.5 mM Ca2+ uptake by the proximal membrane vesicles from 0.53 +/-: 0.06 to 0.72 +/- 0.06 pmol/mu g/10 s (p < 0.05). In the presence of Na+, however, this effect disappeared. In the distal tubules, intravesicular GTP gamma s increased 0.5 mM Ca2+ uptake in the absence (from 0.57 +/- 0.02 to 0.79 +/- 0.02 pmol/mu g/10 s, p < 0.02) and in the presence (from 0.36 +/- 0.03 to 0.55 +/- 0.03 pmol/mu g/10 s, p < 0.02) of Na+. The action of GTP gamma s, when present, was dose dependent with a half-maximal effect at 20 mu M. The distal luminal membrane is the site of two Ca2+ channels with different kinetics parameters. GTP gamma s increased the V-max value of the low-affinity component exclusively, in the presence as in the absence of Na+. Finally, Ca2+ uptake by the membranes of the two segments was differently influenced by toxins: cholera toxin slightly stimulated transport by the proximal membrane, but had no influence on the distal membrane, whereas pertussis toxin decreased the cation uptake by the distal tubule membrane exclusively. We conclude that the nature of Ca2+ channels differs in the proximal and distal luminal membranes: Ca2+ channels present in the proximal tubule and the low-affinity Ca2+ channels present in the distal tubule membranes are directly regulated by Gs and Gi proteins respectively, whereas the high-affinity Ca2+ channel in the distal tubule membrane is insensitive to any of them.

J	Chakrabarti, SK				Chakrabarti, SK			Altered regulation of dopaminergic activity and impairment in motor function in rats after subchronic exposure to styrene	PHARMACOLOGY BIOCHEMISTRY AND BEHAVIOR			English	Article						styrene; subchronic neurotoxicity; dopaminergic system; motor function; uptake and release; receptor binding; rats	WORKERS; BRAIN; METABOLITES; RECEPTORS; MONOMER; 6,7-DIHYDROXY-2-DIMETHYLAMINOTETRALIN; PHARMACOKINETICS; NEUROTOXICITY; POLYSTYRENE; AGONISTS	Animal and human studies suggest a dopamine-mediated effect of styrene neurotoxicity. However, the results reported to date are incomplete and not consistent. As such, the mechanism of its neurotoxicity is still unclear. The present study has, therefore, reexamined the central dopaminergic system in relation to some neurobehavioral effects in rats following subchronic exposure to styrene. Groups of adult male Sprague-Dawley rats received 0, 0.25, or 0.5 g styrene per kg b.wt. by gavage for 13 consecutive weeks. Twenty-four hours after cessation of such treatment with the higher dose (0.5 g/kg), the contents of dopamine (DA) and its metabolites were significantly reduced in the corpus striatum, hypothalamus, and lateral olfactory tract regions. In vitro styrene showed a significant increase in DA release from rat striatal synaptosomes similar to that of tyramine. Significant loss of motor function was observed on days 56. 70, and 84 during the styrene treatment with the higher dose, and lasted over a month after such treatment. However, the treated animals recovered their motor function within 45-60 days after cessation of such treatment, along with the recovery of normal levels of dopamine and its metabolites. Furthermore, styrene-induced initial impairments in measures of dopaminergic activity cannot be attributed to altered regulation of tyrosine hydroxylase activity. Specific [H-3]-spiroperidol binding was also unaltered 7 or 15 days after subchronic treatment with styrene. These data imply that despite the dopaminergic neuronal loss due to styrene, dopaminergic transmission was not reduced to a level that would result in an overall development of dopamine receptor supersensitivity in the striatum. Collectively, these studies indicate that the subchronic neurotoxic action of styrene may be primarily presynaptic in nature and may involve impaired regulation of DA content and stimulation of DA release.

Skin expression levels of the POMC gene and POMC/corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) peptides are not static but are determined by such factors as the physiological changes associated with hair cycle (highest in anagen phase), ultraviolet radiation (UVR) exposure, immune cytokine release, or the presence of cutaneous pathology. Among the cytokines, the proinflammatory interleukin-1 produces important upregulation of cutaneous levels of POMC mRNA, POMC peptides, and MSH receptors; UVR also stimulates expression of all the components of the CRH/POMC system including expression of the corresponding receptors. Molecular characterization of the cutaneous POMC gene shows mRNA forms similar to those found in the pituitary, which are expressed together with shorter variants. The receptors for POMC peptides expressed in the skin are functional and include MC1, MC5 and mu-opiate, although most predominant are those of the MC1 class recognizing MSH and ACTH. Receptors for CRH are also present in the skin. Because expression of, for example, the MC1 receptor is stimulated in a similar dose-dependent manner by UVR, cytokines, MSH peptides or melanin precursors, actions of the ligand peptides represent a stochastic (predictable) nonspecific response to environmental/endogenous stresses. The powerful effects of POMC peptides and probably CRH on the skin pigmentary, immune, and adnexal systems are consistent with stress-neutralizing activity addressed at maintaining skin integrity to restrict disruptions of internal homeostasis. Hence, cutaneous expression of the CRH/POMC system is highly organized, encoding mediators and receptors similar to the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. This CRH/POMC skin system appears to generate a function analogous to the HPA axis, that in the skin is expressed as a highly localized response which neutralizes noxious stimuli and attendant immune reactions.

During a single exposure, the fetus responds with an arrest of breathing activity, and the neonate, with excitation followed by depression (the biphasic response). Mechanisms under active consideration include chemosensory resetting, hypometabolism, prevalence of inhibitory neurotransmitter/modulator influence, and supramedullary regulation of control functions. When exposed to recurrent episodic hypoxia, neonates respond with relative hypoventilation, i.e. tolerance to a subsequent hypoxic stimulus. Whereas the investigation of processes responsible for this tolerance is at its infancy, studies using chronic hypoxia appear to be a useful guide. So far, altered interstitial neuromodulator levels and central markers of programmed neuronal death are harbingers of future research in this field. The clarification of the mechanisms involved in response to recurrent episodic hypoxia during development will be of fundamental value and may be useful for the eventual treatment and/or prevention of harmful central respiratory-related processes.

This neurological mutant has been proposed as an animal model of human cerebellar ataxia, in particular of the Friedreich's type; thus, it was deemed of interest to examine the endogenous contents of dopamine (DA) and metabolites as well as the distribution of DA receptors of the D-1 and D-2 subtypes, in order to delimit the biochemical characteristics of this pathological disorder, and determine an eventual dopaminergic dysfunction in this mutant. Tissue DA and its major metabolites 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid, homovanillic acid and 3-methoxytyramine were measured by HPLC coupled to electrochemical detection in six cortical regions, in four divisions of rostral neostriatum and two halves of caudal neostriatum, as well as in olfactory bulb, nucleus accumbens, septum, amygdala, hippocampus, thalamus, hypothalamus, brainstem, cerebellum, substantia nigra, and ventral tegmental area. The only significant difference between dtJ/dtJ mice and wild-type controls was an increase in hypothalamic DA contents (+47%). Quantitative autoradiography with [H-3]SCH23390 and [H-3]raclopride, to label D-1 and D-2 receptors, respectively, revealed only moderate changes in receptor densities in a few localized regions. In dt(J)/dt(J) mutants, D-1 receptor numbers were found to be higher in thalamus (+27%) as well as in the medio-dorsal (+16%) and in the latero-dorsal (+16%) quadrants of rostral neostriatum, while D-2 receptor densities were greater in the medio-ventral (+32%) and the latero-dorsal (+17%) quadrants. The present results indicate an overall conservation of dopaminergic functions, albeit the few localized sites of increased D-1 and D-2 receptor densities, and that are seemingly independent of the DA innervation pattern, as revealed by the tissue measurements of DA and metabolites. They also rule out a major pathology linked to deficits in DA neurotransmission, and validate this mutant as an animal model of human cerebellar ataxia, probably of the Friedreich type.

Although the molecular mechanisms governing such activity-controlled morphological alterations are mostly elusive, polysomal accumulations at the base of developing dendritic spines(3) and the activity-induced synthesis of synaptic components suggest that localized translation is involved during synaptic plasticity(4,5). Here we show that large aggregates of translational components as well as messenger RNA of the postsynaptic glutamate receptor subunit DGluR-IIA(6) are localized within subsynaptic compartments of larval neuromuscular junctions of Drosophila melanogaster. Genetic models of junctional plasticity(7) and genetic manipulations using the translation initiation factors eIF4E(8) and poly(A)binding protein(9) showed an increased occurrence of subsynaptic translation aggregates. This was associated with a significant increase in the postsynaptic DGluR-IIA protein levels and a reduction in the junctional expression of the cell-adhesion molecule Fasciclin II. In addition, the efficacy of junctional neurotransmission and the size of larval neuromuscular junctions were significantly increased. Our results therefore provide evidence for a postsynaptic translational control of long-term junctional plasticity.

It has been suggested that this anomalous sympathetic fibre innervation of the DRG plays a role in neuropathic pain. Other studies have suggested an interaction between sympathetic and sensory fibres more peripherally. To date, no anatomical study of these possible interactions in the terminal fields of sensory and sympathetic fibres has been performed; therefore, the authors set out to study them in the rat lower lip after bilateral lesions of a sensory nerve, the mental nerve (MN). Immunocytochemistry for both substance P (SP) and dopamine-beta-hydroxylase (D beta H) was performed. Within the first week post-MN lesions, the SP-immunoreactive (IR) fibres had degenerated almost completely, whereas D beta H-IR fibres were found in the upper dermis, an area from which they normally are absent. These D beta H-IR fibres were present in the upper dermis at all postsurgery times studied (1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8 weeks). It is noteworthy that, although, by week 6 post-MN lesions, SP-IR fibre reinnervation of the lower lip was occurring, the D beta H-IR fibres still were present in the upper dermis. Quantification revealed that the migration and branching of the D beta H-IR fibres into the upper dermis occurred gradually and was most significant at 4 weeks post-MN lesions, as demonstrated by the fact that the D beta H-IR fibres were found 169.6 +/- 91.4 mu m away from the surface of the skin compared with 407.1 +/- 78.4 mu m away in sham-operated animals. These findings suggest that the ectopic innervation of the upper dermis by sympathetic fibres may be important in the genesis of neuropathic pain through the interactions of sympathetic and SP-containing sensory fibres.

In order to study the overexpression of AMF/PHI, an HA-tagged AMF construct was transiently transfected into Cos7 cells. Expression of a tagged AMF-HA allowed us to determine that over a period of 16 hours only a small amount (0.1-1%) of total cellular AMF-HA was secreted into the cell medium. Cell-associated AMF-HA was exclusively cytosolic as it could be completely extracted with Triton X-100 and concentrated within actin rich pseudopodial domains. Treatment of the cells with the glycolysis inhibitor oxamate disrupted the association of AMF-HA with actin concentrations demonstrating that glycolysis regulates the formation of these AMF/PHI-associated actin-rich protrusions. AMF/PHI is a well-characterized tumor cell secreted cytokine and we identify here an alternate intracellular function for this glycolytic enzyme/cytokine in cell motility, (C) 2000 Academic Press.

The present studies investigated the role of the paraventricular nucleus (PVN), ventromedial nucleus (VMH), and medial preoptic nucleus (MPOA) in the hyperphagic actions of PRL. Ad-libitum-fed virgin female rats received twice daily site-specific injections of PRL (800 ng) over a period of 10 days. Only subjects demonstrating regular vaginal cyclicity were included in the study. Food intake, body weight, and vaginal cyclicity were measured daily. Results showed that PRL significantly increased food intake when injected into the PVN. A nonsignificant trend towards a hyperphagic response in the last 5 days of testing was observed in rats receiving intra-VMH injections of PRL, and the MPOA was not responsive to the feeding-stimulating properties of PRL. None of the manipulations affected body weight or vaginal cyclicity as demonstrated by vaginal smears. In sum, the present results reveal that one brain site at which PRL acts to increase food intake is the PVN, but these studies do not rule out the possibility that the effects of PRL on food intake may also involve other brain areas.

Go-planar stereotaxic atlas of the human brain. New York: Thieme). The patterns formed by the individual sulci were then examined and compared with those of the less convoluted macaque monkey brain. Four sulci forming a similar sulcal pattern were identified in both species. The olfactory sulcus occupies the most medial position forming the lateral border of the gyrus rectus. Lateral to this, the medial, lateral, and transverse orbital sulci form a pattern often resembling an "H," "X," or "K." These sulci divide the orbitofrontal cortex into four major gyri: the medial, lateral, anterior, and posterior orbital gyri. Three major types of sulcal pattern were identified in both species based on the arrangement of these orbital sulci. Additional sulci were observed in the human brain, creating more complex patterns. Probability maps were constructed for the four main orbitofrontal sulci of the human brain. These maps provide a statistical description of the variability of the location of the orbitofrontal sulci within the three-dimensional coordinate system of Talairach and Tournoux (Talairach and Tournoux [1988]. Go-planar stereotaxic atlas of the human brain. New York: Thieme). Because these maps may be directly compared with any image transformed into the same standardized space, they provide a valuable tool for identifying and describing the location of functional or structural changes in the orbitofrontal region of the human brain.

The ability of inositol stereoisomers to interact with and stabilize small A beta complexes was addressed. Circular dichroism spectroscopy demonstrated that epi- and scyllo- but not chiro-inositol were able to induce a structural transition from random to beta-structure in A beta 42. Alternatively, none of the stereoisomers were able to induce a structural transition in A beta 40. Electron microscopy demonstrated that inositol stabilizes small aggregates of A beta 42. We demonstrate that inositol-A beta interactions result in a complex that is non-toxic to nerve growth factor-differentiated PC-12 cells and primary human neuronal cultures. The attenuation of toxicity is the result of A beta-inositol interaction, as inositol uptake inhibitors had no effect on neuronal survival. The use of inositol stereoisomers allowed us to elucidate an important structure-activity relationship between A beta and inositol. Inositol stereoisomers are naturally occurring molecules that readily cross the blood-brain barrier and may represent a viable treatment for AD through the complexation of A beta and attenuation of A beta neurotoxic effects.

Important for its initiation are the pontomesencephalic cholinergic neurons that project into the pontomedullary reticular formation and that we have recently shown increase c-Fos expression as a reflection of neural activity in association with PS rebound after deprivation in rats (Maloney et al., 1999). As a continuation, we examined in the present study c-Fos expression in the pontomedullary reticular and raphe neurons, including importantly GABAergic neurons [immunostained for glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD)] and serotonergic neurons [immunostained for serotonin (Ser)]. Numbers of single-labeled c-Fos+ neurons were significantly increased with PS rebound only in the pars oralis of the pontine reticular nuclei (PnO), where numbers of GAD+/c-Fos+ neurons were conversely significantly decreased. c-Fos+ neurons were positively correlated with PS, whereas GAD+/c-Fos+ neurons were negatively correlated with PS, suggesting that disinhibition of reticular neurons in the PnO from locally projecting GABAergic neurons may be important in the generation of PS. In contrast, through the caudal pons and medulla, GAD+/c-Fos+ cells were increased with PS rebound, covaried positively with PS and negatively with the electromyogram (EMG). In the raphe pallidus-obscurus, Ser+/c-Fos+ neurons were positively correlated, in a reciprocal manner to GAD+/c-Fos+ cells, with EMG, suggesting that disfacilitation by removal of a serotonergic influence and inhibition by imposition of a GABAergic influence within the lower brainstem and spinal cord may be important in the development of muscle atonia accompanying PS.

The focus of the review is terrestrial species, with particular attention given to the genus Helix. In accordance with a standard definition of "brain," the cerebral ganglion is found to be differentiated both structurally and functionally. It receives convergent sensory inputs from a variety of anterior sensory organs plus the posterior body wall. Its outputs comprise motor commands directed towards anterior muscle systems, e.g., the tentacles and the penis, as well as premotor commands directed towards executory centers in other ganglia, e.g., the buccal, visceral, and pedal ganglia. Of the three major divisions in the ganglion, the procerebrum and the mesocerebrum are the most differentiated, whereas the metacerebrum is the least differentiated. The specializations of the procerebrum for olfactory functions, and the mesocerebrum for reproductive functions, reflect the importance of adaptations for feeding and mating in the evolution of the Gastropoda.

Astrocytes were shown to be involved in the regulation of LHRH neuronal function, but little is known about the contribution of astroglial-derived factors in the regulation of LHRH neuron development. In order to gain insight into the mechanisms regulating the development of these cells, at morphological and biochemical levels we characterized the neurotrophic effects exerted by young astrocytes (maintained in culture for 8 days in vitro) and old astrocytes (maintained 26 days) on the differentiation, proliferation, and phenotypic expression of immortalized hypothalamic LHRH (GT(1-1)) neurons in vitro. Culturing GT(1-1) cells in the presence of young glia for different time intervals caused a marked acceleration in the acquisition of their neuronal phenotype. At all times examined, GT(1-1) cells cocultured with young glia exhibited a significantly greater extension of processes/cell, larger number of processes/cell and greater surface area of growth cones than GT(1-1) cells grown over nonglial adhesive substrates (polylysine). By contrast, when GT(1-1) neurons were cocultured with old glia, the length of neuronal processes and the growth cone surface area were significantly lower than in control GT(1-1) neurons cultured in the absence of glia. At 3 days in vitro (DIV), GT(1-1) neurons cocultured with young glia exhibited a 50% lower incorporation of [H-3]thymidine than GT(1-1) neurons cultured without glia. By contrast, in the presence of old glia [H-3] thymidine incorporation was significantly higher in cells cocultured with glia than in GT(1-1) neurons cultured alone. Localization of the proliferating cells by dual immunohistochemical staining revealed that the incorporation of bromodeoxiuridine (BrdU) was restricted to nuclei of GT(1-1) neurons when these were cocultured with young glia, but associated with both neurons and astrocytes in the presence of old glia, At the functional level, coculture of GT(1-1) neurons with young glia increased the spontaneous release of LHRH as compared to GT(1-1) neurons grown in the absence of glia. By contrast, in the presence of old glia LHRH release in the medium was significantly lower than in controls. Conditioned medium of young glia (ACM-Y) induced significant neurotrophic and functional effects on GT(1-1) cells, but these effects were 50% less potent than the coculture itself. Heat denaturation of ACM-Y totally abolished its neurotrophic and functional properties, indicating that they involved a peptide factor. Suppression of bFGF activity in ACM-Y reduced its neurotrophic activity by approximately 40%, but did not affect its LHRH release-promoting effects. By contrast, neutralization of endogenous bFGF activity in GT(1-1) neurons cocultured with young glia counteracted both neurotrophic and functional effects of young glia. Treatment of old glia with bFGF rescued its neurotrophic and functional effects on GT(1-1) cells. Moreover, the ACM of aged bFGF-treated old glia was the most powerful neurotrophic stimulus for GT(1-1) neurons. These results suggest that: 1) soluble peptidic factors, including bFGF, and mechanism(s) requiring coculture are responsible for the highly potent neurotrophic and functional effects of young glia; 2) the inhibitory effects of old glia on neurite outgrowth and LHRH release are mediated in part by soluble inhibitory molecules and in part by factors requiring coculture with old glia; 3) old glia may revert to a growth-supporting state when treated with bFGF and this functional shift involves a diffusible molecule with potent neurotrophic and functional effects on immortalized LHRH neurons.

Endogenous serotonin, dopamine, noradrenaline and some of their major metabolites were measured in the frontal cortex, neostriatum, thalamus, brainstem, cerebellum and spinal cord. In +/+ mice, buspirone (1 mg/kg; i.p.) treatment during 40 days increased indoleamines, albeit with moderate changes in the ratios between tissue serotonin metabolites and endogenous serotonin, augmented noradrenaline contents in the spinal cord, and caused elevations of dopamine metabolites in most regions. In Lc/+ mutants, the effects of buspirone were attenuated, but higher L-tryptophan and indoleamine levels, suggest a storage of serotonin in a non-releasable compartment. In the hypoplastic Lc/+ cerebellum, indoleamine content was accrued, but with a decreased [serotonin metabolites]/[serotonin] ratio, indicating that the reorganized nerve terminals in Lc/+ mutants although they call synthesize and accumulate serotonin, may not utilize it efficiently in synaptic transmission.

J	Lefebvre, C; Fisher, K; Cahill, CM; Coderre, TJ				Lefebvre, C; Fisher, K; Cahill, CM; Coderre, TJ			Evidence that DHPG-induced nociception depends on glutamate release from primary afferent C-fibres	NEUROREPORT			English	Article						capsaicin; excitatory amino acids; metabotropic glutamate receptors; mGluR; pain	RAT SPINAL-CORD; DORSAL HORN; ENDOGENOUS GLUTAMATE; RECEPTORS; HYPERALGESIA; AGONISTS; NEURONS; 3,5-DIHYDROXYPHENYLGLYCINE; LAMOTRIGINE; HIPPOCAMPUS	We examined whether enhanced glutamate release contributes to the expression of persistent spontaneous nociceptive behaviours (SNBs) in rats induced by intrathecal (i.t.) administration of the selective group I mGluR agonist, (RS)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine ((RS)-DHPG). Pretreatment with drugs that have been shown to inhibit glutamate release, including a group II metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) agonist (2R,4R)-4-aminopyrrolidine-2,4-dicarboxylate ((2R,4R)-APDC), a group III mGluR agonist L-2-amino-4-phosphonobutyrate (L-AP4), or the use-dependent sodium channel blockers 3,5-diamino-6-(2,3-diclorophenyl)-1,2,4-triazine (lamotrigine) and 2-amino-6-trifluoromethoxybenzothiazole (riluzole), produced dose-dependent reductions in (RS)-DHPG-induced SNBs. We have also shown that incubation of rat lumbar spinal cord slices with (RS)-DHPG potentiates 4-aminopyridine-evoked (4-AP) release of glutamate. Furthermore, we found that destruction of unmyelinated primary afferent C-fibres by neonatal capsaicin treatment significantly reduced (RS)-DHPG-induced SNBs in adult rats. Together, these results suggest that (RS)-DHPG-induced nociception is dependent on spinal glutamate release, probably from primary afferent C-fibres.

During sleep, brain temperatures are in part determined by the level of brain cooling activity, which may be reflected by facial skin temperatures. In many animals, the level of brain cooling activity oscillates across the NREM-REM sleep cycle. Facial skin temperatures during sleep in patients with winter depression are abnormally low and uncorrelated with octal temperatures, although their relationship to EEG-defined sleep stages remains unknown. We therefore measured the sleep EEG, fore body and facial skin temperatures in 23 patients with winter depression and 23 healthy controls, and tested the hypothesis that ultradian oscillations in facial skin temperatures exist in humans and are abnormal in patients with winter depression. We found that facial skin temperatures oscillated significantly across the NREM-REM sleep cycle, and were again significantly lower and uncorrelated with rectal temperatures in patients with winter depression Mean slow-wave activity and NREM episode duration were significantly greater in patients with winter depression, whereas the intraepisodic dynamics of stow-wave activity were normal in patients with winter depression. These results suggest that brain cooling activity oscillates in an ultradian manner during sleep in humans and is reduced during winter depression, and provide additional support for the hypothesis that brain temperatures are elevated during winter depression.

Based on previous psychophysical experiments on healthy subjects it was concluded that directional sensibility depends on two kinds of information from cutaneous mechanoreceptors; spatio-temporal information and information about friction-induced changes in skin stretch. In the present study responses to similar probe movements as in the psychophysical experiments were recorded from human single mechanoreceptors in the forearm skin. All slowly adapting type 2 (SA2) units were spontaneously active, and with increasing force of friction their discharge rates were modified by probe movements at increasing distances from the Ruffini end-organ, reflecting the high stretch-sensitivity of these units. Slowly adapting type 1 (SA1) and held units responded to the moving probe within well-defined skin areas directly overlying the individual receptor terminals, and compared to the SA2 units their response properties were less dependent on the force of friction. The results suggest that SA1 and field units have the capacity to signal spatio-temporal information, whereas a population of SA2 units have the capacity to signal direction-specific information about changes in lateral skin stretch.

Fos induced by exposure of rats to fox urine or a neutral odor, mineral oil, was markedly enhanced during the subjective night compared to subjective day in the main olfactory bulb, primary olfactory cortex, and other structures related to olfaction. These results show that neuronal responses to an ethologically relevant odor follow a circadian rhythm similar to biologically neutral odors. Fos responses induced by fox urine were observed to be of greater magnitude than a neutral odor in brain areas involved in fear responses, suggesting that fox urine activates fear circuitry.

(1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 10897-10901). The biochemical nature of NCLK-microtubule association is not known. In this study we found that NCLK is released from microtubules upon microtubule disassembly as a 450-kDa species. The 450-kDa species is an NCLK tau complex, and NCLK-bound tau is in a nonphosphorylated state. Tau phosphorylation causes NCLK tau complex dissociation, and phosphorylated tau does not bind to NCLK. In vitro, the Cdk5 subunit of NCLK binds to the microtubule-binding region of tau and NCLK associates with microtubules only in the presence of tau. Our data indicate that in brain extract NCLK is complexed with tau in a tan phosphorylation-dependent manner and that tau anchors NCLK to microtubules. Recently NCLK has been suggested to be aberrantly activated and to hyperphosphorylate tau in Alzheimer's disease brain (Patrick, G. N., Zukerberg, L., Nikolic, M., de la Monte, S., Dikkes, P, and Tsai, L.-H. (1999) Nature 402, 615-622). Our findings may explain why in Alzheimer's disease NCLK specifically hyperphosphorylates tau, although this kinase has a number of protein substrates in the brain.

They have been found to predict behavioral problems and psychiatric disorders. This study examined the extent to which minor physical anomalies, family adversity, and their interaction predict violent and nonviolent delinquency in adolescence. Method: Minor physical anomalies were assessed in a group of 170 adolescent boys from low socioeconomic status neighborhoods of Montreal. The boys had been enrolled in a longitudinal study since their kindergarten year, when an assessment of family adversity had been made on the basis of familial status and the parents' occupational prestige, age at the birth of the first child, and educational level. Adolescent delinquency was measured by using self-reported questionnaires and a search of official crime records. Results: Results from logistic regression analyses indicated that both the total count of minor physical anomalies and the total count of minor physical anomalies of the mouth were significantly associated with an increased risk of violent delinquency in adolescence, beyond the effects of childhood physical aggression and family adversity. Similar findings were not found for nonviolent delinquency. Conclusions: Children with a higher count of minor physical anomalies, and especially a higher count of anomalies of the mouth, could be more difficult to socialize for different and additive reasons: they may have neurological deficits, and they may have feeding problems in the first months after birth. Longitudinal studies of infants with minor physical anomalies of the mouth are needed to understand the process by which they fail to learn to inhibit physical aggression.

Whether cardiac reinnervation occurs after transplantation remains controversial. If reinnervation does occur, how sympathetic and parasympathetic efferent neurons do this remains unknown. Methods. Power spectral analysis of heart rate variability was assessed for 1 year after cardiac autotransplantation in 9 dogs. After induction of anesthesia 13 months after transplantation, cardiac and intrinsic cardiac neuronal responses elicited by both electrical stimulation of parasympathetic or sympathetic efferent neurons and systemic or local coronary artery administration of nicotine (5 mu g/kg), angiotensin II (0.75 mu g/kg), and tyramine (1.2 mu g/kg) were studied. The transmembrane electrical properties of intrinsic cardiac neurons were studied in vitro. Ventricular tissue catecholamine content, alpha-tubulin expression, and beta-adrenergic receptor density and affinity were studied. The presence of axons crossing suture lines was sought histologically. Results. Nerves were identified crossing suture lines. Electrical or chemical (ie, nicotine or angiotensin II) activation of sympathetic efferent neurons enhanced cardiodynamics, as did tyramine. Stimulating vagal efferent preganglionic axons induced bradycardia in half of the dogs. Functional reinnervation did not correlate with specific power spectra derived from rate variability in the conscious state. Responding to nicotine and angiotensin II in situ, transplanted intrinsic cardiac neurons generated spontaneous activity. These neurons displayed nicotine-dependent synaptic inputs in vitro. Ventricular tissue had normal beta-adrenergic receptor affinity and density but reduced catecholamine and alpha-tubulin contents. Conclusions. The intrinsic cardiac nervous system receives reduced input from extracardiac sympathetic efferent neurons after transplantation and inconsistent input from parasympathetic efferent preganglionic neurons. These heterogeneous neuronal inputs are not reflected in heart rate variability or ventricular beta-adrenergic receptor function. Transplanted angiotensin II-sensitive intrinsic cardiac neurons exert greater cardiac control than do nicotine-sensitive ones. The intrinsic cardiac nervous system remodels itself after cardiac transplantation, and this indicates that direct assessment of extracardiac and intrinsic cardiac neuronal behavior is required to fully understand cardiac control after transplantation.

We present what is to our knowledge the first immunohistochemically documented case of a paraganglioma of the tongue, a 2.5-cm benign tumor growing in the position of the foramen cecum. The patient was an elderly woman who presented with throat irritation. The histologic profile and ultrastructural appearance of this lesion were classic for paraganglioma, and cells stained strongly for neurosecretory granules by immunohistochemistry. Carcinoid, ectopic thyroid neoplasm, and other tumors that mimic paraganglioma were ruled out on immunohistochemical grounds. To our knowledge, paraganglia have not been previously documented in the tongue; this tumor may have arisen from a branch of cranial nerve VII or IX, or from an embryologic remnant of the thyroid or thyroid capsule.

Design: Validity study on persons with traumatic brain injury (TBI) and test-retest reliability study on a randomly selected subset of patients. Factor analyses, kappa statistics, intraclass correlation coefficients, and Cronbach's alphas were used. Setting: Inpatients from 15 French hospitals, mainly rehabilitation units. Other recruitment sites included a neurology hospital unit and a psychiatry hospital specifically devoted to TBI rehabilitation. Patients: Two hundred eighty-six TBI patients ages 16 to 70 years (convenience sample). Results: For the reliability study, the average of percentages of agreement among the items was 74.3% and the average of kappa statistics was .40. Factor analyses disclosed a maximum likelihood extraction of 5 correlated factors (F), explaining 42.2% of total variance: (F1) deficits in intentional behavior and in memory, (F2) lowering of emotional state, (F3) emotional and behavioral hyperactivation, (F4) lowering of arousal state and of attention, and (F5) language and speech problems. Results support the criterion validity of the factors. Reliability of the factor scores and internal consistencies of factors were very good. Conclusions: Results describe some important properties of the NRS-R and, through an understanding of its underlying structure and relationships with the patients' clinical characteristics, contribute to the conceptual framework of neuropsychologic impairments after TBI.

This may be related to the nature of the neuroleptic treatment of schizophrenic patients as conventional neuroleptics may be more deleterious than new atypical neuroleptics. However, there is no comparative study on the effect of specific neuroleptics on procedural learning. In this study, three groups of patients treated with different neuroleptics were compared to nor mal controls on two procedural learning tasks. In a visuo-motor task, patients and controls showed similar learning rates, although schizophrenic patients showed generally lower performances than normal controls. However, patients treated with a conventional neuroleptic, but not those treated with the atypical neuroleptics, showed many fluctuations during the initial learning phase. In a problem-solving task, all groups were comparable in performance and learning fluctuations, but learning rates were lower in patients treated with the neuroleptic showing the higher incidence of extrapyramidal symptoms. This suggests that procedural learning abilities may be significantly affected by neuroleptics in schizophrenia, although the effect may differ between tasks and the specific neuroleptics. Fluctuations in the initial learning phase of the visuo-motor task probably results from a frontal dysfunction while reduced learning rates, such as those observed in the problem solving task, may he attributed to a striatal dysfunction. This is concordant with the differential pharmacological actions of the conventional and atypical neuroleptics in these two cerebral areas. (C) 2000 Academic Press.

Neuromotor profiles were created according to thirty characteristics extracted from test results of four subgroups matched for age and composed of six subjects each. Z scores were calculated with respect to the mean and standard deviation of the control group for each of the 30 characteristics. The subgroup with the lower methylmercury blood level had larger z scores than the control subgroup and with a few positive values above one standard deviation. The subgroup with the higher methylmercury blood level had several;scores above two standard deviations. Interestingly, the abnormal values for the subgroup with Parkinson's disease were mostly limited to static tremor recorded with no visual feedback and reached up to 5 standard deviations. These results indicate that neuromotor profiles can be used to summarize information extracted from different neuromotor tests and to differentiate neurological conditions. (C) 2000 Academic Press.

Our experiment tested this hypothesis using the N400 event-related brain potential in a priming paradigm and assessed whether older subjects could benefit from the constraints of a sentence context. Twenty older (63 to 88 years) and 70 young (19 to 29 years) subjects read sentences and word pairs. Each final word varied on the degree of relatedness to the preceding context, with some being highly related (BC), moderately related (R), or unrelated (U) Younger subjects showed the expected N400 effect gradient (U > R > BC) in both the sentence and word-pair contexts, while older adults showed no discrimination between the conditions (U = R = BC) for the sentence and limited discrimination (U > BC) for the word pairs. These results support the inhibition-deficit hypothesis, whereby older adults fail to inhibit related items in working memory, and suggest that older adults do not benefit from the constraints of a sentence context.

Their dictation-taking performance was assessed via a comprehensive standardized neuropsychological test battery following a protocol specifically designed fur the purpose (Lecours, 1996). The patients' performance was compared with normative data from the general population. The results show that the patients committed graphemic paragraphias, that is, they replaced target graphemes with others representative of the corresponding phoneme (ph and f for/f/, in French) or with graphemes representative of a similar phoneme (v for/f/). These errors suggest that components of a cognitive model of writing are dysfunctional (C) Academic Press.

We hypothesized that spasmophilia may negatively affect neuromotor. functions in subtle ways. Three tests including tremor, rapid pointing movements, and alternating movements were quantified in a group of subjects with spasmophilia symptoms (SS) (n = 10) and a healthy control group (n = 10). Most of the characteristics used to evaluate motor functions in these three tests revealed no significant differences between the two groups except for two characteristics in alternating movements and two characteristics in rapid pointing movements. In terms Of variances, a dissociation between voluntary movements and involuntary movements was observed for the two groups. Control subjects had significantly higher variances in involuntary movements such as tremor, while subjects with SS had significantly higher variances in voluntary movements such as alternating and rapid pointing movements. A significant increase in asymmetry in hand laterality was also noted for some characteristics in subjects with SS. (C) 2000 Academic Press.

Subjects were required to monitor for a target word in sentences that were either normal, semantically anomalous, or both syntactically and semantically anomalous. Stimuli were presented at two rates of speech-normal and compressed to 70% of normal. Contrary to expectations, the RHD group performed similar to normals in demonstrating an effect of context at both rates of speech. Results are discussed relative to recent studies of normal brain functioning that suggest that the involvement of the LH versus the RH in context use depends upon the type ol contextual information being processed.

Resection of the left hemisphere occurred at age 5 years 6 months, following intractable epilepsy. Tests of language comprehension (pointing, understanding of prepositions. understanding of narratives) and production (naming, repetition, lexical diversity, grammatical production) were administered at ages 6:2, 6:4, 6:6, and 6 years 9 months. Observations showed little progress, if any, in most aspects of linguistic performance. In contrast to studies with left-hemispherectomized children, AB showed only a modest expansion of the semantic lexicon and the phonological repertoire more than a year after the surgical intervention. These observations indirectly suggest (I)poor functional involvement of the right hemisphere in the development of adequate linguistic abilities, (2) the necessary integrity of the Ln for adequate development of language, or (3) that variations in individual brain maturation rates may account for AB's linguistic progress.

Results revealed that motivation manipulations selectively affected attention switching mechanisms, but did not influence either inhibition of crosstalk from competing stimuli, or basic response execution time. This provides additional evidence for distinct attentional systems involved in resolution of response and perceptual competition. Speculations regarding the neural systems that mediate both motivation and attention switching are considered, pointing to a possible involvement of dopominergic influences on the ventral striatum.

In the present series of experiments we investigate the interaction of corticosterone and the neurosteroid dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) on LTP in the rat dentate gyrus. In confirmation of previous studies, we found that corticosterone (2 mg/kg) had decremental effects on LTP. However, simultaneous injection of corticosterone and DHEAS (30 mg/kg) elicited excitatory post-synaptic potentials and population spikes that were not significantly different from those observed in control animals. The results are discussed in terms of the interaction of the two hormones, the agonist effects of DHEAS on sigma receptors, and their relation with the antidepressant effects of DHEA.

It was believed that OT is released from hypothalamic nerve terminals of the posterior hypophysis into the circulation where it stimulates uterine contractions during parturition, and milk ejection during lactation. However, equivalent concentrations of OT were found in the male hypophysis, and similar stimuli of OT release were determined for both sexes, suggesting other physiological functions. Indeed, recent studies indicate that OT is involved in cognition, tolerance, adaptation and complex sexual and maternal behaviour, as well as in the regulation of cardiovascular functions. It has long been known that OT induces natriuresis and causes a fall in mean arterial pressure, both after acute and chronic treatment, but the mechanism was not clear. The discovery of the natriuretic family shed new light on this matter. Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), a potent natriuretic and vasorelaxant hormone, originally isolated from rat atria, has been found at other sites, including the brain. Blood volume expansion causes ANP release that is believed to be important in the induction of natriuresis and diuresis, which in turn act to reduce the increase in blood volume. Neurohypophysectomy totally abolishes the ANP response to volume expansion. This indicates that one of the major hypophyseal peptides is responsible for ANP release. The role of ANP in OT-induced natriuresis was evaluated, and we hypothesized that the cardio-renal effects of OT are mediated by the release of ANP from the heart. To support this hypothesis, we have demonstrated the presence and synthesis of OT receptors in all heart compartments and the vasculature. The functionality of these receptors has been established by the ability of OT to induce ANP release from perfused heart or atrial slices. Furthermore, we have shown that the heart and large vessels like the aorta and vena cava are sites of OT synthesis. Therefore, locally produced OT may have important regulatory functions within the heart and vascular beds. Such functions may include slowing down of the heart or the regulation of local vascular tone.

Serum folate, vitamin B-12, and plasma total homocysteine were measured as well as the specific activity of MTHFR in lymphocytes. The frequency of subjects homozygous for the 677TT genotype was 18 %, and that of those homozygous for the 1298CC genotype was 12.5 %. The frequency of individuals heterozygous for both mutations was 23.5 %. The 1298A --> C mutation was associated with decreased MTHFR specific activity in subjects with both 677CC and 677CT genotypes. This activity was 60 % for the 677CC/1298AC genotype and 52 % for the 677CC/1298CC genotype when compared with the MTHFR specific activity of the 677CC/1298AA genotype. Heterozygotes for both mutations (677CT/1298AC genotype) had 36 % of the reference specific activity. Although homocysteine levels in 677TT and 1298CC genotype subjects were higher than for other genotypes, no significant differences were observed among different genotypes. This may be due to high serum folate level in our samples, and suggests that folate therapy may be useful to prevent hyperhomocysteinaemia in homozygous mutant subjects.

These receptors can either collaborate with or inhibit each other's actions to mediate neurotrophin effects. The development and survival of neurons is thus based upon the functional interplay of the signals generated by Trk and p75NTR. In the past two years, the signaling pathways used by these receptors, including Akt and MAPK-induced signaling via Trk, and JNK, p53, and NF-kappa B signaling via p75NTR, have been identified. In addition, a number of novel p75NTR-interacting proteins have been identified that transmit growth, survival, and apoptotic signals.

Recently, we reported that the human gene is located on chromosome 20, region q13.1. We now report the genomic organization of both the human and mouse stau genes. Amplification of genomic DNA and sequencing of the resulting PCR products indicated that the human and mouse genes are fragmented into 15 and 12 exons, distributed over at least 65 and 17 kb of genomic DNA, respectively. The three additional exons found in the human gene are subjected to differential splicing, generating four different transcripts. Corresponding exons have not been found in mouse transcripts. Apart from those three exons, the overall organization of the stau gene is similar in the two species, and the positions of the exon-intron junctions are perfectly conserved. Even an alternative choice between two splicing acceptor sites, which causes an insertion of 18 nucleotides in exon 5, is conserved in both humans and mice. An extremely G+C-rich region lacking canonical TATA and CAAT boxes was found upstream of the most 5' RACE sequence, suggesting that a housekeeping-like promoter drives the broad expression of Staufen in mammalian cells. This work represents the first step toward production of knockout mice and the elucidation of putative Staufen-linked hereditary diseases in humans.

We hypothesized that larvae of the lady beetle Coleomegilla maculata lengi Timberlake select molting and pupation sites that effectively reduce their susceptibility to intraguild predation. We characterized microsites on potato plants and evaluated their associated risk of predation by the lacewing Chrysoperla rufilabris Burmeister (Neuroptera: Chrysopidae), a common intraguild predator. The majority of molts (>60%) occurred on potato plants in sites similar to those used bl mobile coccinellid larvae. In contrast, 90% of the larvae left the plant to pupate. Second, third, and fourth instars selected artificial shelters for both molting and pupation when these were available. Vulnerability of pupae and newly molted larvae to lacewing larvae depended on plant microsite. with leaves supporting an aphid colony as the most risky sites, Molting and pupating microhabitat selection ty coccinellid larvae appears to be a trade-off between the advantages of remaining close to the aphid resource, and the costs of being exposed to intraguild predators.

Methods: We studied 51 patients with localization-related epilepsy. Patients were divided into three groups according to the EEG investigation: (a) temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE, n = 21), (b) extratemporal lobe epilepsy (extra-TLE, n = 20), and (c) multilobar epilepsy (patients with a wider epileptogenic zone, n = 10). We acquired proton magnetic resonance (MR) spectrocopic imaging (H-1-MRSI) of temporal and frontocentroparietal regions in separate examinations for both patients and controls. NAA/Cr values 2 standard deviations below the mean of normal controls were considered abnormal. Results: Twenty-three (45%) patients including 12 with TLE had normal MR imaging including volumetric studies of the hippocampus. Forty-nine (96%) patients had low NAA/Cr, indicating neuronal dysfunction in either temporal and/or extratemporal H-1-MRSIs; 38% of patients with TLE and 50% of patients with extra-TLE also had NAA/Cr reduction outside the clinical and EEG-defined primary epileptogenic area. The NAA/Cr reduction was more often widespread in the multilobar group [six (60%) of 10] than in temporal or extratemporal groups [five (31%) of 16]. Nonparametric tests of (a) seizure duration, (b) seizure frequency, and (c) lifetime estimated seizures showed no statistically significant difference (p > 0.05) for TLE and extra-TLE patients with or without NAA/Cr reduction outside the seizure focus. Conclusions: Of patients with localization-related epilepsy, 40-50% have neuronal metabolic dysfunction that extends beyond the epileptogenic zone defined by clinical-EEG and/or the structural abnormality defined by MRI.

A finding that might explain this selectivity is that interleukin-6 acts on sensory neurons in culture through a mechanism requiring endogenous brain-derived neurotrophic factor. Antibodies or a trkB fusion protein that block the biological activity of brain-derived neurotrophic factor synthesized by dorsal root ganglion neurons also block the survival-promoting actions of interleukinB on these neurons. Two results indicate that interleukin-6 influences synthesis of brain-derived neurotrophic factor in adult dorsal root ganglion neurons. Intrathecal infusion of interleukin-6 in rats increases the concentration of brain-derived neurotrophic factor mRNA in rat lumbar dorsal root ganglia. The induction of brain-derived neurotrophic factor in dorsal root ganglion neurons that is seen after nerve injury in rats or wild-type mice is severely attenuated in mice with null mutation of the interleukin-6 gene. In brief, the ability of interleukin-6 to support the survival of embryonic sensory neurons in vitro depends upon the presence of endogenous brain-derived neurotrophic factor and the induction of brain-derived neurotrophic factor in injured adult sensory neurons depends upon the presence of endogenous interleukin-6.

J	Pitcher, GM; Henry, JL				Pitcher, GM; Henry, JL			Cellular mechanisms of hyperalgesia and spontaneous pain in a spinalized rat model of peripheral neuropathy: changes in myelinated afferent inputs implicated	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Review						chronic pain; dorsal horn; electrophysiology; neuropathic pain; pain; sciatic nerve injury; spinal cord	DORSAL-ROOT GANGLION; CONSTRICTION NERVE INJURY; PRIMARY SENSORY NEURONS; LONG-TERM POTENTIATION; SCIATIC-NERVE; HORN NEURONS; POSTHERPETIC NEURALGIA; TACTILE ALLODYNIA; ADRENERGIC SENSITIVITY; RECEPTOR ANTAGONISTS	Various hypotheses have been proposed to account for the mechanical hyperalgesia and spontaneous pain seen in animal models of peripheral neuropathy. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether there exists a spinal neuronal correlate to these properties. An experimental neuropathy was induced in male Sprague-Dawley rats by placing a 2-mm PE-90 polyethylene cuff around the sciatic nerve. All rats were subsequently confirmed to exhibit mechanical allodynia in the von Frey test. After induction of anaesthesia with pentobarbital and acute spinalization at T-9, electrophysiological experiments were performed, recording extracellular single unit activity from ipsi- and contralateral wide dynamic range dorsal horn neurons in spinal segments L1-4. Ongoing activity was greater in short-term (11-22 days after cuff implantation) and long-term (42-52 days) cuff-implanted rats; 38 spikes/s in short-term versus 19 spikes/s in controls; 29 spikes/s in long-term ipsi- and contralateral neurons. Receptive fields in controls were always restricted, but in almost all cuff-implanted rats extended over the whole hind paw, Responses to noxious mechanical (pinch) and noxious heat stimulation of the cutaneous receptive field in controls consisted of the typical fast initial discharge followed by an afterdischarge. In all neurons from cuff-implanted rats the initial discharge resembled that in controls, However, the afterdischarge, particularly that in response to noxious pinch, was markedly greater in both magnitude and duration, It is suggested that the greater on-going discharge is the cellular correlate of spontaneous pain, and the potentiation of the afterdischarge in response to noxious stimulation is the correlate of hyperalgesia. Given that acutely spinalized rats were tested, only peripheral and/or spinal mechanisms can be considered to explain these data, Considering all the data, it can be concluded that there is a greater change in fibres mediating noxious mechanical than noxious thermal inputs. Among different hypotheses, the one with which the present data are most compatible is that which proposes that chronic nerve injury or inflammation induces phenotypic changes predominantly in myelinated afferents, There may be a redistribution of membrane-bound ion channels, predominantly sodium channels, which leads to ectopic activity and thus spontaneous discharge of dorsal horn neurons. With regard to mechanical stimulation-evoked synaptic input, the central terminals of myelinated afferents expand into regions of the spinal cord which normally receive their predominant input from unmyelinated nociceptive afferents, This may be coupled with a change in these myelinated afferents so that they now synthesize and release peptides, primarily substance P, from their central terminals with the result that the effects of their chemical mediators of synaptic transmission add to the effects of nociceptive inputs leading to exaggerated responses to painful stimuli, thus the basis of clinical hyperalgesia.

The present study was undertaken in rats to examine the effects upon electroencephalogram (EEG) activity and sleep-wake state of inactivating basal forebrain neurons with microinjections of procaine versus activating them with microinjections of agonists of glutamate, which is the primary neurotransmitter of the brainstem reticular activating system. Microinjections into the basal forebrain were performed using a remotely controlled device in freely moving, naturally sleeping/waking rats during the day when they are asleep the majority of the time. Procaine produced a decrease in gamma (30-60 Hz) and theta (4-8 Hz) EEG activities, and an increase in delta (1-4 Hz) associated with a loss of paradoxical sleep, despite the persistence of slow wave sleep. alpha-Amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) produced an increase in gamma and a decrease in delta, while eliciting waking, In addition, NMDA, which has been shown in vitro to induce rhythmic bursting in the cholinergic cells, significantly increased theta activity. Following the microinjections of NMDA, c-Fos protein, which has been shown to reflect neural activity, was found in numerous cholinergic, and also GABAergic (gamma-aminobutyric acid) and other non-cholinergic neurons, in the substantia innominata and magnocellular preoptic nucleus near the microinjection cannulae. These results substantiate the role of cholinergic, possibly together with other, basal forebrain neurons in cortical activation, including elicitation of gamma and theta activities that underlie cortical arousal during waking and paradoxical sleep.

In two initial experiments, the spatial period in the direction of the scan (longitudinal SP) was varied from 1.5 to 5 mm, while the transverse SP was kept constant at 2 mm. These surfaces were identical to those used in single unit recording experiments in primates which have shown that neurones in primary somatosensory cortex (SI) show graded changes in discharge over the same range of SPs. In the third and fourth experiments, roughness perception was studied over an extended range of longitudinal SPs (1.5-8.5 mm); transverse SP was either 1 or 2 mm. We also examined the effects on roughness perception of presenting the surfaces at two different scanning speeds (similar to 50 and similar to 95 mm/s), similar to those employed in the unit recordings. Magnitude estimates of perceived roughness increased in a nearly linear fashion as longitudinal SP was increased up to either 5 mm (experiments 1 and 2) or 8.5 mm (experiments 3 and 4). A modest increase in the transverse SP elicited a small increase in roughness estimates, with preservation of the linear relation between roughness and longitudinal SP. The roughness sensation evoked by each surface was not affected by the change of the temporal pattern of scanning (Low and High speeds). These results showed that there is perceptual constancy for roughness across a twofold change in passive scanning speed, and that roughness is a function of the spatial characteristics of these raised dot surfaces. While a spatial code may underlie this observation, it is suggested that a simpler intensive code may be sufficient to explain the psychophysical observations. Based on the results of neurophysiological recordings in SI cortex, it is suggested that an invariant central representation of surface roughness could be extracted from the ambiguous peripheral signals that covary with roughness and the stimulating conditions (e.g. speed) by means of a simple subtraction process.

The presence of aberrant NF accumulation has been associated with neurodegenerative diseases (such as ALS). The possible causal role of NF in neurodegeneration has been supported by studies on recently available transgenic mice in which expression of human NF-H (hNF-H +/+) leads to overt neuropathy. We have examined electrophysiological properties of myelinated axons in hNF-H +/+ mice using intraaxonal microelectrode recording from isolated sciatic and tibial nerves. Transgenic mice showed several deficits in physiological properties of low threshold myelinated fibers: conduction velocity and resting membrane potential were significantly decreased (20 +/- 1.6 vs 40 +/- 2 m/s; -71.3 +/- 0.9 vs -75.5 +/- 0.5 m/s; mean +/- SE; n = 25; 22 degrees C). While the amplitude of action potentials was of comparable size (82 +/- 5 vs 86 +/- 3 mV) duration of action potential (at half-amplitude, AP/2) in hNF-H +/+ was significantly prolonged (0.82 +/- 0.02 vs 0.65 +/- 0.02 ms). Voltage-current properties of axonal membrane indicate a significant decrease in inward and outward rectification. Occasionally, impaled axons of hNF-H +/+ showed membrane oscillations and repetitive activity (reminiscent of fasciculations) never observed in normal animals. These results are compatible with an imbalance between ion conductances in axons from transgenic animals (an increase in Na+ and a decrease in K+ conductances), in agreement with recent suggestion based on clinical studies on ALS patients (H. Bostock et al., 1995, Brain 118, 217-225). One may hypothesize that these changes could contribute to neurodegenerative processes (i.e., via an increase in [Na+](i)), as well as clinical symptoms (fasciculations) observed in patients with degenerative motor neuron diseases.

In the first experiment, plasma leptin levels were measured on Days 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 postpartum in freefeeding lactating rats and age-matched virgin females. Retroperitoneal and parametrial fat pads weights were obtained from the same females. In the second experiment the same measures, together with plasma insulin and prolactin levels, were taken on Days 15 and 20 postpartum from galactophore-cut and sham-operated females. In Experiments 3 and 4, the effects of exogenous leptin administration, either subcutaneously (sc) or intracerebroventricularly (icv), on lactational anovulation, maternal food intake, and dam and litter weights were examined. Circulating leptin levels decreased in lactating rats. Leptin levels were highly positively correlated with fat pad weight. Eliminating the energetic costs of lactation by preventing milk delivery induced dramatic increases in plasma leptin and insulin levels and also increased adiposity. Exogenous leptin administration did not affect length of lactational anovulation but reduced food intake, maternal body weight, and litter weight gain when given centrally and maternal body weight when given systemically. Together, these data show that the energetic costs of lactation are associated with a fall in circulating leptin levels but that these do not make a major contribution to the suppression of reproduction in lactating rats; however, they may be permissive to the hyperphagia of lactation.

J	Oates, M; Woodside, B; Walker, CD				Oates, M; Woodside, B; Walker, CD			Chronic leptin administration in developing rats reduces stress responsiveness partly through changes in maternal behavior	HORMONES AND BEHAVIOR			English	Article						leptin administration; developing rats; stress responses; maternal behavior	PITUITARY-ADRENAL AXIS; ADRENOCORTICAL SYSTEM; NEONATAL RATS; PUPS; CORTICOSTERONE; RESPONSES; RELEASE; HORMONE; GLAND; ONSET	In adult rodents, leptin has been shown to significantly alter the activity of several neuroendocrine functions, including the activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Leptin is generally believed to be inhibitory to HPA activity in adults. Developing rat pups have high circulating levels of leptin, which begs the question of leptin's physiological role in controlling basal and stress-induced adrenocortical activity in neonatal rats. In this study, we treated rat pups daily from days 2-9 (or 6-10) of life with either vehicle or leptin (1 or 3 mg/kg body wt, ip) and determined the effects on body weight gain, fat pad deposits, and HPA activity in 10-day-old pups. We measured hypothalamic CRF mRNA levels in vehicle- and leptin-treated pups by in situ hybridization and determined plasma ACTH, corticosterone, and leptin concentrations under basal conditions or following exposure to a 3-min ether stress. Because leptin activates sympathetic activity and energy expenditure in adults and possibly also in rat pups, and because litter temperature is an important determinant of maternal behavior, we also investigated whether chronic leptin administration would modify aspects of maternal care that are important for the maintenance of HPA function. Chronic leptin treatment increased circulating levels of leptin and had significant dose-related metabolic effects, including reduced body weight gain and fat pad weight in 10-day-old pups. Basal expression of CRF mRNA in the PVN or secretion of ACTH and corticosterone was not modified by leptin treatment. In contrast, chronically elevated leptin concentrations during the neonatal period significantly lowered CRF expression in the PVN 60 min after stress and reduced the duration of the ACTH response to stress in pups, suggesting that glucocorticoid feedback on the HPA axis might be altered by this treatment. In addition, mothers caring for pups injected with leptin displayed longer bouts of anogenital licking of pups than mothers of vehicle-treated rats. Given that this particular type of pup stimulation has been shown to influence stress responsiveness, it is possible that the maternal response modulates the effects of exogenous leptin treatment. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that the leptin signal is functional during the early developmental period and that leptin can modulate the hormonal response to stress in young rats either by a direct effect on the HPA axis or indirectly through changing some aspects of maternal behavior.

Interactions of Candida species with mucin and human buccal epithelial cells (BECs) were thus investigated in vitro. Binding of the Candida species to purified small intestinal mucin showed a close correlation with their hierarchy of virulence. Significant differences (P < 0.05) were found among three categories of Candida species adhering highly (C. dubliniensis, C. tropicalis, and C. albicans), moderately (C. parapsilosis and C. lusitaniae) or weakly (C. krusei and C. glabrata) to mucin. Adherence of C. albicans to BECs was quantitatively inhibited by graded concentrations of mucin. However, inhibition of adherence was reversed by pretreatment of mucin with pronase or C. albicans secretory aspartyl proteinase Sap2p but not with sodium periodate, Saturable concentration- and time-dependent binding of mucin to C, albicans was abrogated by pronase or Sap2p treatment of mucin but was unaffected by beta-mercaptoethanol, sodium periodate, neuraminidase, lectins, or potentially inhibitory sugars. Probing of membrane blots of the mucin with C. albicans revealed binding of the yeast to the 66-kDa cleavage product of the 118-kDa C-terminal glycopeptide of mucin, Although no evidence was found for the participation of C. albicans cell surface mannoproteins in specific receptor-ligand binding to mucin, inhibition of binding by p-nitrophenol (1 mM) and tetramethylurea (0.36 M) revealed that hydrophobic interactions are involved in adherence of C. albicans to mucin. These results suggest that C. albicans may both adhere to and enzymatically degrade mucins by the action of Saps, and that both properties may act to modulate Candida populations in the oral cavity and gastrointestinal tract.

INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RADIATION ONCOLOGY BIOLOGY PHYSICS			English	Article						brain stem tumors; treatment; radiotherapy; chemotherapy	HYPERFRACTIONATED RADIATION-THERAPY; PEDIATRIC-ONCOLOGY-GROUP; PHASE-I/II TRIAL; CANCER-GROUP; TUMORS; GY	Purpose: To compare the proportion of patients that survive at least 1 year following treatment with hyper-fractionated radiotherapy (HRT) to a dose of 70.2 Gy on Pediatric Oncology Group (POG) study #8495 with that of patients treated with similar radiotherapy plus cisplatinum given by continuous infusion on weeks 1, 3, and 5 of radiotherapy on FOG #9239. Methods and Materials: The eligibility criteria for the two studies were identical and included age 3 to 21 years, previously untreated tumor involving the brain stem of which two-thirds was in the pens, history less than 6 months, and clinical findings typical for diffuse intrinsic brain stem glioma, including cranial nerve deficits, long tract signs, and ataxia, The outcome of 57 patients who were treated at the 70.2 Gy dose level of FOG #8495 between May 1986 and February 1988 was compared with that of 64 patients treated with identical radiotherapy plus cisplatinum on FOG #9239 between June 1992 and March 1996. Results: The number of patients accrued to FOG #9239 was determined to guarantee that the probability was at least-0.80 of correctly detecting that the 1-year survival rate exceeded that of patients on FOG #8495 by 0.2, However, the z value for this test was -1.564, giving ap value of 0.9411. That is, there is almost sufficient evidence to conclude that survival for patients receiving HRT plus cisplatinum on FOG #9239 was worse than that for patients receiving the same radiotherapy alone on FOG #8495. Conclusion: The finding that patients who received cisplatinnm given as a radiosensitizing agent concurrent with HRT-fared less well than those receiving the same dose of HRT alone was unexpected and is clearly a cause for concern as many current protocols for patients with diffuse intrinsic brain stem gliomas call for use of chemotherapeutic and/or biological agents given concurrent with radiotherapy.

Methods: MEDLINE was searched for articles published from January 1981 to November 1997 using the following keywords: AD and longitudinal study or prognosis or cognitive decline. The bibliographies of review articles and relevant papers were searched for additional references. All retrieved articles were screened to meet the following inclusion criteria: (a) original study; (b) addressed cognitive decline or prognosis or course of AD; (c) published in English; (d) study population included AD patients with ascertainable sample size; (e) used either clinical or pathological diagnostic criteria; (f) longitudinal study design; and (g) used the MMSE as one of the outcome measures. Data were systematically abstracted from the included studies, and a random effects regression model was employed to synthesize relevant data across studies and to evaluate the effects of study methodology on ARC estimation and its effect size. Results: Of the 439 studies screened, 43 met all the inclusion criteria. After 6 studies with inadequate or overlapping data were excluded, 37 studies involving 3,492 AD patients followed over an average of 2 years were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled estimate of ARC was 3.3 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.9-3.7). The observed variability in ARC across studies could not be explained with the covariates we studied, whereas part of the variability in the effect size of ARC could be explained by the minimum MMSE score at en try and number of assessments. Conclusions: A pooled average estimate of ARC in AD patients was 3.3 points (95% CI: 2.9-3.7) on the MMSE. Significant heterogeneity of ARC estimates existed across the studies and cannot be explained by the study or population characteristics investigated. Effect size of ARC was related to the initial. MMSE score of the study population and the number of assessments.

Patients and Methods: Three hundred three patients were randomized to DOX 50 mg/m(2) intravenously (IV) on day 1 and VNB 25 mg/m(2) IV on days 1 and 8 (arm 1) or DOX 70 mg/m(2) IV on day 1 (arm 2). Both regimens were given every 3 weeks until a cumulative DOX dose of 450 mg/m(2). After 16 of the first 65 randomized patients experienced febrile neutropenia (FN), the doses were reduced to DOX 40 mg/m(2) on day 1 and VNB 20 mg/m(2) on days 1 and 8 versus DOX 60 mg/m(2) on day 1. Eligible patients were vinca alkaloid and anthracycline naive. Chemotherapy was first-line or second-line for MBC. Results: Three patients were ineligible. Thus, 300 patients were assessable for toxicity and to determine time to disease progression (TTP), TTF, and OS. Two hundred eighty-nine patients were assessable for response, and 99 responders were assessable for response duration (RD). The response rates, QOL, and median RD, TTP, and TTF were not significantly different between the arms. Median OS was 13.8 months for arm 1 versus 14.4 months for arm 2 (P = .4). Grade 3 or 4 granulocytopenia was equivalent in both arms but more grade 3/4 neurotoxicity, mild venous toxicity, and FN were seen on arm 1. Conclusion: The survival with DOX and VNB is not superior to BOX alone in MBC. J Clin Oncol 18:2385-2394. (C) 2000 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.

Overlap was defined as the range of spatial frequencies shared by a pair of filtered images. This factor was manipulated by processing image pairs with high-pass/low-pass filter pairs whose 50% cutoff points varied in their separation from one another. The effects of the center frequency of biter pairs were also investigated. In general, performance improved with greater overlap and higher center frequency. In control conditions, the image pain were processed with identical biters and thus had complete overlap. Even severely filtered low-pass or high-pass images in these conditions produced superior performance. These results suggest that face recognition is more strongly affected by spatial frequency overlap than by the frequency content of the images.

Most reports depict adult onset secondary tic disorders caused by trauma, encephalitis, and other acquired conditions. Only rare reports describe idiopathic adult onset tic disorders, and most of these cases represent recurrent childhood tic disorders. Objective-To describe a large series of patients with tic disorders presenting during adulthood, to compare clinical characteristics between groups of patients, and to call attention to this potentially disabling and underrecognised neurological disorder. Methods-Using a computerised database, all patients with tic disorders who presented between 1988 and 1998 to the movement disorders clinic at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center after the age of 21 were identified. Patients' charts were retrospectively reviewed for demographic information, age of onset of tics, tic phenomenology, distribution, the presence of premonitory sensory symptoms and tic suppressibility, family history and associated psychiatric features. These patients' videotapes were reviewed for diagnostic confirmation and information was obtained about disability, course, and response to treatment in a structured follow UP interview. Results-Of 411 patients with tic disorders in the database, 22 patients presented for the first time with tic disorders after the age of 21. In nine patients, detailed questioning disclosed a history of previous childhood transient tic disorder, but in 13 patients, the adult onset tic disorder was new. Among the new onset cases, six patients developed tics in relation to an external trigger, and could be considered to have secondary tic disorders. The remaining patients had idiopathic tic disorders. Comparing adult patients with recurrent childhood tics and those with new onset adult tics, the appearance of the tic disorder, the course and prognosis, the family history of tic disorder, and the prevalence of obsessive-compulsive disorder were found to be similar. Adults with new onset tics were more likely to have a symptomatic or secondary tic disorder, which in this series was caused by infection, trauma, cocaine use, and neuroleptic exposure. Conclusions-Adult onset tic disorders represent an underrecognised condition that is more common than generally appreciated or reported. The clinical characteristics of adults newly presenting to a movement disorder clinic with tic disorders are reviewed, analysed, and discussed in detail. Clinical evidence supports the concept that tic disorders in adults are part of a range that includes childhood onset tic disorders and Tourette's syndrome.

J	Saint-Amant, L; Drapeau, P				Saint-Amant, L; Drapeau, P			Motoneuron activity patterns related to the earliest behavior of the zebrafish embryo	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						spinal cord; patch clamp; in vivo; rhythmic activity; synaptic transmission; locomotion	RAT SPINAL-CORD; LUMBAR MOTONEURONS; LOCOMOTOR NETWORK; INTRACELLULAR PH; PATCH-CLAMP; NEURONS; BRAIN; CELL; OSCILLATIONS; TRANSMISSION	As a first step in the study of the developing motor circuitry of the embryonic zebrafish spinal cord, we obtained patch-clamp recordings in vivo from identified motoneurons in curarized embryos from the onset of the first motor behavior. At an early developmental stage in which embryos showed slow and repetitive spontaneous contractions of the trunk, motoneurons showed periodic depolarizations that triggered rhythmic bursts of action potentials with a frequency and duration that were consistent with those of the spontaneous contractions. The periodic depolarizations were blocked by tetrodotoxin or Cd2+. Surprisingly, the contractions and periodic depolarizations were insensitive to general blockade of synaptic transmission (by elevated Mg2+ and reduced Ca2+, or by Co2+) and to selective blockade of the major neurotransmitter receptors of the mature spinal cord (acetylcholine, GABA(A), NMDA, AMPA/kainate, and glycine). The periodic depolarizations were suppressed by heptanol or by intracellular acidification, treatments that are known to uncouple gap junctions, indicating that electrotonic synapses could underlie the earliest motor behavior. A few hours later, most motoneurons already showed a new pattern of repetitive activity consisting of bursts of glycinergic synaptic events, but these were not necessary for the spontaneous contractions. Transecting the spinal cord at the hindbrain border did not affect the rhythmic activity patterns of the motoneurons. We suggest that spontaneous contractions of the zebrafish embryo are mediated by an early spinal circuit that is independent of the main neurotransmitter systems and descending hindbrain projections that are required for locomotion in the mature vertebrate spinal cord.

In contrast, hippocampal neurons use the regulated secretory pathway to process brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which alters synaptic activity when released acutely from dense-core vesicles. Thus, understanding how neurons sort and deliver neurotrophins may provide clues to their functions in brain. In this study, we monitored the processing and delivery of neurotrophin-3 (NT-3). Pulse-chase studies, immunocytochemistry, and secretagogue-induced release experiments were performed on cultured hippocampal neurons and AtT-20 cells infected with vaccinia viruses encoding the NT-3 precursor (pro-NT-3). Results show that most newly synthesized NT-3 is released through the constitutive secretory pathway as a result of furin-mediated endoproteolytic cleavage of pro-NT-3 in the trans-Golgi network. Pro-NT-3 can also be diverted into the regulated secretory pathway when cells are treated with alpha 1-PDX, a selective inhibitor of furin-like enzymes, or when pro-NT-3 expression is increased by transient transfection methods. In cells coinfected with viruses coding for pro-NT-3 and pro-BDNF, NT-3 is sorted into the regulated pathway, stored in secretory granules, and released in response to extracellular cues together with BDNF, apparently as a result of heterodimerization, as suggested by coimmunoprecipitation data. Taken together, these data show that sorting of the NT-3 precursor can occur in both the constitutive and regulated secretory pathways, which is consistent with NT-3 having both survival-promoting and synapse-altering functions.

Neuroleukin is a neurotrophic factor that promotes neuronal survival and sprouting at the neuromuscular junction. The AMF receptor (AMF-R) has been identified and shown to be highly expressed in malignant tumors with minimal expression in adjacent normal tissue. Neuroleukin mRNA is highly expressed in the cerebellum and we therefore undertook a developmental study of AMF-R expression in rat cerebellum. As determined by immunoblot, AMF-R is expressed at equivalent high levels in brain and cerebellum of postnatal day 5 (P5) and 12 (P12) rats and at significantly reduced levels in the adult. Co-immunofluorescence studies with MAP-2 and gamma-actin revealed that at P12, AMF-R was mainly localized to Purkinje and granule cells. Moreover, the premigratory cells of the external granular layer were also immunoreactive for AMF-R suggesting a role for AMF-R in granule cell migration during cerebellar development in the first two weeks after birth. In the adult, AMF-R distribution was similar to P12, although weaker, and was localized to Purkinje and granule cells. AMF-R labeling of GFAP positive glial processes could not be detected in cerebellar sections although in cerebellar primary cultures, both neurons and glial cells were labeled for AMF-R. In neurons, AMF-R labeling was present in the cell body, neurites and growth cones. These data indicate that regulation of the neurotrophic function of neuroleukin might be regulated spatially and temporally by expression of its receptor, AMF-R, in developing and adult cerebellum.

We report the results of a multicenter trial designed to assess the efficacy of sacral nerve neuromodulation in patients presenting with refractory urinary urgency-frequency. Materials and Methods: A total of 51 patients from 12 centers underwent baseline assessment, including a detailed voiding diary, urodynamic evaluation and percutaneous test stimulation of the sacral nerves at S3 and/or S4. All patients enrolled in the study had undergone prior conventional treatment, such as pharmacotherapy, hydrodistention and surgical intervention, which failed. All patients demonstrated a satisfactory response to trial stimulation and were randomly divided into a stimulation group (25 patients) and a control group (26), A sacral nerve stimulation device was implanted after 6 months in the control group. Patients were followed at 1, 3 and 6 months, and at 6-month intervals for up to 2 years after implantation of a neuroprosthetic InterStim* system.dagger The study variables included the number of voids daily, volume voided per void and degree of urgency before void. Results: Compared to the control group, 6-month voiding diary results demonstrated statistically significant improvements (p <0.0001) in the stimulation group with respect to the number voids daily (16.9 +/- 9.7 to 9.3 +/- 5.1), volume per void (118 +/- 74 to 226 +/- 124 ml.) and degree of urgency (rank 2.2 +/- 0.6 to 1.6 +/- 0.9). Patients in the control group showed no significant changes in voiding parameters at 6 months. Significant improvements in favor of the stimulation group were noted in various parameters with respect to water cystometry and quality of life (SF-36). At 6 months after implant, neurostimulators were turned off in the stimulation group and urinary symptoms returned to baseline values. After reactivation of stimulation sustained efficacy was documented at 12 and 24 months. Conclusions: Neuromodulation of the sacral nerves is an effective, safe therapy that successfully treats significant symptoms of refractory urgency-frequency.

Sucrose and Optiprep gradient analyses reveal cosedimentation of hStau with purified HIV-1, while subtilisin assays demonstrate that it is internalized. hStau incorporation in HIV-1 is selective, is dependent on an intact functional dsRNA-binding domain, and quantitatively correlates with levels of encapsidated HIV-1 genomic RNA. By coimmunoprecipitation and reverse transcription-PCR analyses, we demonstrate that hStau is associated with HIV-1 genomic RNA in HIV-1-expressing cells and purified virus, Overexpression of hStau enhances virion incorporation levels, and a corresponding, threefold increase in HIV-1 genomic RNA encapsidation levels. This coordinated increase in hStau and genomic RNA packaging had a significant negative effect on viral infectivity, This study is the first to describe hStau within HIV-1 particles and provides evidence that hStau binds HIV-1 genomic RNA, indicating that it may be implicated in retroviral genome selection and packaging into assembling virions.

Neurofilament proteins are synthesized in the cell body and move down the axon with the slow axonal transport component. For many years, the axonal transport of neurofilaments was a controversial issue. On one hand, some studies suggested that neurofilaments were transported as polymers whereas other experiments led to a model of subunit transport combined to their dynamic assembly with stationary filaments along the axon. Recently, a new approach led to the in vivo visualization of neurofilaments tagged with green fluorescent protein (GFP). The results indicate that the slow transport of neurofilaments result from the rapid movement of polymers interrupted by prolonged pauses. Moreover, the neurofilament transport Is asynchronous and bidirectional, which explains the difficulties to observe their movements. Although the molecular mechanisms underlying neurofilament transport remain to be elucidated, there is emerging evidence of a role for motors of the kinesin family. Alterations in assembly and transport of neurofilaments could be involved in neurodegenerative diseases. Transgenic mouse studies showed that the formation of filamentous aggregates, especially in the axon, can sometimes provoque neuronal death.

Although mechanisms underlying osmoreception are understood, the cellular basis for the integration of osmotic and peptidergic signals remains unknown. Here we show that the excitatory effects of angiotensin II, cholecystokinin and neurotensin on supraoptic neurosecretory neurons are due to the stimulation of the stretch-inactivated cation channels responsible for osmoreception. This molecular convergence underlies the facilitatory effects of neuropeptides on responses to osmotic stimulation and provides a basis for the gating effects of plasma osmolality on the responsiveness of osmoregulatory neurons to peptidergic stimulation.

We investigated the effects of Ang II on gross visual activity in the colliculus of anesthetized rats aged between 15 and 35 post-natal days. Microinjection of Ang II in the superficial layers yielded a strong reduction in the amplitude of visual evoked potentials in a dose-related manner. Injection of the peptide in more ventral collicular layers did not modify the potential confirming the discrete localization of the angiotensinergic receptors in the superficial layers. Preliminary data indicated that the co-injection of Ang II with Losartan or PD 123319 yielded a partial blockade of Ang II suppressive effects, indicating that both AT(1) and AT(2) receptors are likely to be involved in mediating these responses. Overall, this study shows that the inhibitory nature of Ang II action is similar in juvenile and adult animals (Merabet et at. 1994 and Merabet et al. 1997) (C) 2000 Harcourt Publishers Ltd.

Characterization of an MCH specific receptor has been hampered by the lack of a suitable radioligand. The [Phe(13), Tyr(19)]-MCH analog has been shown by different investigators to bind specifically to cell lines of epithelial or pigment cell origin. Recently, using functional assays, the MCH receptor has been characterized as a seven transmembrane G-coupled protein initially identified as SLC-1. in the present study, we used tyrosine iodinated [Phe(13), Tyr(19)]-MCH analog, which stimulates food intake in a manner similar to that of MCH, as well as native MCH to conduct binding studies. Specific binding could not be demonstrated in intact cells of several cell lines, including A431 and B16. Specific binding associated with membranes localized to the microsomal, not the plasma membrane, fraction. Message for SLC-1 was absent in these cell lines, as assessed by Northern blot analysis. We conclude that cells previously reported to express the MCH receptor do not express SLC-I and that both iodinated MCH and the [Phe(13), Tyr(19)]-MCH have a large component of non-specific binding. These ligands may be useful for binding studies in transfected cells with high levels of SLC-I expression. However they do not appear to be suitable for screening for the MCH receptor as most cells demonstrate significant low affinity non-specific binding. (C) 2000 Harcourt Publishers Ltd.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a 5-year longitudinal evaluation, 30 patients with MS underwent conventional magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, MT MR imaging, and clinical assessment. Cross-sectional data in 12 healthy subjects were also collected. Semiautomated lesion classification with use of T2-weighted MR images was used to measure the time course of the MT ratio (calculated with MR data acquired without and with MT saturation) in every voxel and to help analyze the relationship with the status of lesions depicted on T2-weighted images. RESULTS: There was a significant (P < .001) temporal decline in lesion MT ratio after lesion appearance on T2-weighted images. A significant (P < .001) progressive decline in MT ratio was also present in voxels that later became lesions, prior to initial detection on T2-weighted images. Even 11/2 years prior to lesion appearance, the MT ratio (33.3%) in regions destined to become such lesions was significantly (P < .001) lower than that in both white matter in healthy subjects (41.3%) and other normal-appearing white matter in patients with MS (38.1%). CONCLUSION: The MT ratio reveals progressive focal abnormalities in MS that antedate by up to 2 years the appearance of lesions on T2-weighted MR images.

Standard neuroleptics can cause sexual dysfunctions. However atypical neuroleptics minimally influence sexual function. Hypoactive sexual desire is the most commonly reported sexual difficulty by schizophrenics, treated or not, with neuroleptic medications. The majority of patients notice a progressive deterioration of their sexual and sociosexual functioning beginning in adolescence or young adulthood This article focuses on the sexual and sociosexual differences reported by schizophrenics.

We thus investigated by light and electron microscopy the association of GABA neurons (labeled for glutamic acid decarboxylase [GAD]) with cortical microvessels and/or NO neurons (identified by nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide [NADPH-D] histochemistry) within the frontoparietal and perirhinal cerebral cortex in the rat. On thick and semithin sections, a high density of GAD puncta was observed, several surrounded intracortical blood vessels and neuronal perikarya. In contrast, NADPH-D cell somata and proximal dendrites were only occasionally contacted by GAD nerve terminals. Perivascular and perisomatic GAD appositions were identified at the ultrastructural level as large (0.44-0.50 mu m(2)) neuronal varicosities located in the immediate vicinity of, or being directly apposed to, vessels or unstained neuronal cell bodies. In both cortical areas, perivascular GAD terminals were located at about 1 mu m from the vessels and were seen to frequently establish junctional contacts (synaptic frequency of 25-40% in single thin sections) with adjacent neuronal but not vascular elements. Ibotenic or quisqualic acid lesion of the substantia innominata did not significantly affect the density of cortical and perivascular GAD terminals, suggesting that they mostly originated locally in the cortex. These results suggest that GABA terminals can interact directly with the microvascular bed and that the somata and proximal dendrites of NO neurons are not a major target for cortical GABA neurotransmission. However, based on the colocalization of GABA and NADPH-D in a subset of cortical neurons, we suggest that these interneurons could be implicated in the cortical vascular response elicited by stimulation of basal forebrain neurons.

Subsequent observations have confirmed its ineffectiveness in schizophrenia. Few studies have addressed its long-term consequences. Methods: We conducted tests of frontal function: behavior (Frontal Behavioral Inventory). psychopathology (PANSS), neurological examinations and CT scans in 19 chronically institutionalized schizophrenic patients (mean age 74) who had undergone orbitofrontal leukotomy between 1948 and 1972 and 11 controls (mean age 74) matched for age, length of hospitalization, education, and diagnosis. Results: There were no significant differences between leukotomized patients and controls on: Folstein Mini-Mental score (leuko 22.13 +/- 5.66; controls 23.55 +/- 5.93), utilization behavior, Luria alternating written and motor sequences, verbal fluency, imitation behavior? motor impersistence, primitive reflexes, or psychopathology. Significant differences were found on clock drawing and on the go/no-go test, which may reflect the presence of an orbitofrontal lesion in the leukotomized group. There was a tendency for the leukotomized group to have fewer indices of frontal behavioral dysfunction. Both groups showed comparable impairment on the Stroop test and cognitive rigidity on the Odd Man Out test of category shifting. Conclusions: With few exceptions, elderly leukotomized and nonleukotomized schizophrenic patients show varying degrees of distractibility, difficulty in set shifting, poor planning and organization, susceptibility to interference, primitive reflexes and signs of global cognitive impairment. Allowing for the small sample size, variability in the surgical frontal lesion, and the long interval from surgery to testing, these observations likely reflect the long-term consequences of severe schizophrenia in both groups.

J	Huang, KX; Paudel, HK				Huang, KX; Paudel, HK			Ser(67)-phosphorylated inhibitor 1 is a potent protein phosphatase 1 inhibitor	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						neuronal cdc2-like protein kinase; cAMP-dependent protein kinase	CYCLIN-DEPENDENT KINASE-5; RABBIT SKELETAL-MUSCLE; CATALYTIC SUBUNIT; BINDING-PROTEINS; DARPP-32; PHOSPHORYLATION; ANALOGS; FAMILY; RAP1; TAU	Inhibitor 1 (I-1) is a protein inhibitor of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), a major eukaryotic Ser/Thr phosphatase, Nonphosphorylated I-1 is inactive, whereas phosphorylated I-1 is a potent PP1 inhibitor. I-1 is phosphorylated in vivo on Thr(35) and Ser(67). Thr(35) is phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (A kinase), and Thr(35)-phosphorylated I-1 inhibits PP1, Until now the kinase that phosphorylates Ser(67) had not been identified and the physiological role of Ser(67) phosphorylation was unknown. In this study we detected a high level of kinase activity in brain extract when a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion I-1 mutant containing an Ala substituted for Thr(35) [GST-I-1(T35A)] was used as the substrate. GST-I-1(T35A) kinase and neuronal cdc2-like protein kinase (NCLK) in the brain extract could not be separated from each other by a series of sequential chromatographies. GST-I-1(T35A) kinase immunoprecipitated with anti-NCLK antibody from kinase-active column fractions. Purified NCLK-phosphorylated GST-I-1(T35A) and I-1 (0.7 mole of phosphate per mole of I-1), HPLC phosphopeptide mapping, amino acid sequencing, and site-directed mutagenesis determined that NCLK phosphorylates Ser(67) of I-1. NCLK-phosphorylated -1 and I-1(T35A) inhibited PP1 with IC50 values approximate to 9.5 and 13.8 nM, respectively, When compared, A kinase-phosphorylated I-1 was only approximate to 1.2 times more inhibitory than NCLK-phosphorylated I-1. Our data indicate that NCLK is a potential in vivo I-1 kinase and that Thr(35) and Ser(67) phosphorylation independently activate I-1.

In brakeless mutants, R1-R6 growth cones frequently fail to terminate migration in their normal target, the lamina, and instead project through it and terminate in the second optic ganglion, the medulla, Genetic mosaic analysis and transgene rescue experiments indicate that bks functions in R cells and not within the lamina target region. bks encodes a nuclear protein. We propose that it participates in a gene expression pathway regulating one or more growth cone components controlling R1-R6 targeting.
