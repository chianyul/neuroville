Genomic selective constraints in murid noncoding DNA	PLOS GENETICS			English	Article							HUMAN HOUSEKEEPING GENES; NON-GENIC SEQUENCES; CONSERVED SEQUENCES; NUCLEOTIDE SUBSTITUTIONS; SYNONYMOUS MUTATIONS; MAMMALIAN GENOMES; HUMAN-DISEASE; ALU REPEATS; EVOLUTION; ELEMENTS	Recent work has suggested that there are many more selectively constrained, functional noncoding than coding sites in mammalian genomes. However, little is known about how selective constraint varies amongst different classes of noncoding DNA. We estimated the magnitude of selective constraint on a large dataset of mouse-rat gene orthologs and their surrounding noncoding DNA. Our analysis indicates that there are more than three times as many selectively constrained, nonrepetitive sites within noncoding DNA as in coding DNA in murids. The majority of these constrained noncoding sites appear to be located within intergenic regions, at distances greater than 5 kilobases from known genes. Our study also shows that in murids, intron length and mean intronic selective constraint are negatively correlated with intron ordinal number. Our results therefore suggest that functional intronic sites tend to accumulate toward the 59 end of murid genes. Our analysis also reveals that mean number of selectively constrained noncoding sites varies substantially with the function of the adjacent gene. We find that, among others, developmental and neuronal genes are associated with the greatest numbers of putatively functional noncoding sites compared with genes involved in electron transport and a variety of metabolic processes. Combining our estimates of the total number of constrained coding and noncoding bases we calculate that over twice as many deleterious mutations have occurred in intergenic regions as in known genic sequence and that the total genomic deleterious point mutation rate is 0.91 per diploid genome, per generation. This estimated rate is over twice as large as a previous estimate in murids.

The ERP old-new effect: A useful indicator in studying the effects of sleep on memory retrieval processes	SLEEP			English	Article						declarative; episodic; memory ERP; sleep; memory processes	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; NON-REM SLEEP; RECOGNITION MEMORY; ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL EVIDENCE; BRAIN POTENTIALS; UNFAMILIAR FACES; LEXICAL DECISION; SYSTEMS; CONSOLIDATION; ORGANIZATION	Study Objectives: To verify that the classic "Old/New" memory effect can be detected after a long delay, and to investigate the differential influence of declarative memory processes after normal sleep and daytime wake. Design: The protocol is a variation of a more traditional study-recognition test used in event-related potential (ERP) studies in which sleep or wake is inserted between the learning and recognition session in order to verify the existence of the Old/New effect (ie, positive shift that occurs when stimuli are repeated). ERPs were recorded during the recognition-test session. The protocol was based on early work that compared the effect of sleep on memory without recording sleep. Setting: Data collection occurred in the outpatient sleep laboratory. Patients or Participants: Results from 13 subjects (6 men) aged between 21 and 39 years. Measurements and Results: The subjects performed the recognition memory test after sleep and daytime wake periods. More-accurate performance for the old (studied) stimuli occurred after the sleep session. Analysis of variance on correctly answered reaction times revealed a significant effect of condition (old/new) with no difference across session. A repeated-measure analysis revealed differences in "Old/New" effect, whereby the amplitude difference between the old and new items was larger after sleep than after wake. Conclusions: This effect of sleep was found in early frontal and later posterior ERP components, processes that represent strategic, contextual processing and facilitation of episodic memory. Memory representation was not different across sessions. These findings suggest that sleep and wake facilitate 2 components of memory unequally, ie, episodic recognition and memory representation functioning.

A common factor detected in premature infants is their postnatal exposure to high oxygen tension relative to that in utero. Hyperoxia is known to elicit injury to premature lung and retina. Because data on the exposure of the brain to hyperoxia are limited, we studied the effects of high oxygen on this tissue. Methods-Rat pups were exposed from birth until day 6 to 21% or 80% O-2. Cerebral vascular density was quantified by lectin immunohistochemistry. Immunoblots for several proteins were performed on brain extracts. We assessed cerebral functional deficits by visual evoked potentials. Results-Exposure of pups to hyperoxia leads to cerebral microvascular degeneration, diminished brain mass, and cerebral functional deficits. These effects are preceded by an upregulation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) in cerebral capillaries and a downregulation of Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD). The imbalance in nitric oxide (NO) production and antioxidant defenses favors the formation of nitrating agents in the microvessels revealed by increased nitrotyrosine (3-nt) immunoreactivity and decreased expression of NF-kappa B and the dependent vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2. NOS inhibitors and eNOS deletion as well as an SOD mimetic (CuDIPS) restore vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 levels and nearly abolish the vasoobliteration. NOS inhibitors and SOD mimetic also prevent O-2-induced diminished brain mass and functional deficit. Conclusions-Data identify NO and nitrating agents as major mediators of cerebral microvascular damage, ensuing impaired brain development and function in immature subjects exposed to hyperoxia.

J	Ryu, JJ; Chaudhuri, A				Ryu, Jae-Jin; Chaudhuri, Avi			Representations of familiar and unfamiliar faces as revealed by viewpoint-aftereffects	VISION RESEARCH			English	Article						face processing; aftereffect; familiarity	RECOGNITION; PERCEPTION	A viewpoint-dependent aftereffect occurs after prolonged viewing of a stimulus of a particular orientation, with the result that the test image is perceived to be facing away from the adapting orientation. Prior psychophysical work has led to the suggestion that the visual brain encodes a limited range of viewpoint information with regard to complex images. In this study, we investigated whether familiar faces were susceptible to a viewpoint aftereffect. Familiar faces are believed to be represented in a view-invariant manner, whereas unfamiliar faces are represented in a viewpoint-dependent manner. Adaptation to both familiar and unfamiliar faces influenced the perception of viewpoint of subsequent face images. However, category-specific transfer of a repulsive viewpoint-dependent aftereffect was observed with unfamiliar faces. Our results suggest that neural networks that mediate viewpoint information are also involved in view-invariant representation of familiar faces. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

An electrophysiological study of mood, modal context, and anaphora	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						P600; N400; discourse structure; modal auxiliary; anaphora; event-related brain potential	SYNTACTIC AMBIGUITY RESOLUTION; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; BRAIN POTENTIALS; WORKING-MEMORY; SENTENCE COMPREHENSION; SEMANTIC ANOMALIES; POSITIVE SHIFT; DISCOURSE; ERP; INTEGRATION	We investigated whether modal information elicited empirical effects with regard to discourse processing. That is, like tense information, one of the linguistic factors shown to be relevant in organizing a discourse representation is modality, where the mood of an utterance indicates whether or not it is asserted. Event-related potentials (ERPs) were used in order to address the question of the qualitative nature of discourse processing, as well as the time course of this process. This experiment investigated pronoun resolution in two-sentence discourses, where context sentences either contained a hypothetical or actual Noun Phrase antecedent. The other factor in this 2 x 2 experiment was type of continuation sentence, which included or excluded a modal auxiliary (e.g., must, should) and contained a pronoun. Intuitions suggest that hypothetical antecedents followed by pronouns asserted to exist present ungrammaticality, unlike actual antecedents followed by such pronouns. Results confirmed the grammatical intuition that the former discourse displays anomaly, unlike the latter (control) discourse. That is, at the Verb position in continuation sentences, we found frontal positivity, consistent with the family of P600 components, and not an N400 effect, which suggests that the anomalous target sentences caused a revision in discourse structure. Furthermore, sentences exhibiting modal information resulted in negative-going waveforms at other points in the continuation sentence, indicating that modality affects the overall structural complexity of discourse representation.

This study aimed to determine whether such expectations can occur preattentively, as indexed by event-related potentials (ERPs), and whether these are modulated by attentional processes. To this end, we recorded ERPs in nonmusicians while they were presented with unfamiliar melodies, containing either a pitch deviating from the equal-tempered chromatic scale (out-of-tune) or a pitch deviating from the diatonic scale (out-of-key). ERPs were recorded in a passive experiment in which subjects were distracted from the sounds and in an active experiment in which they were judging how incongruous each melody was. In both the experiments, pitch incongruities elicited an early frontal negativity that was not modulated by attentional focus. This early negativity, closely corresponding to the mismatch negativity (MMN) of the ERPs, was mainly originated in the auditory cortex and occurred in response to both pitch violations but with larger amplitude for the more salient out-of-tune pitch than the less salient out-of-key pitch. Attentional processes leading to the conscious access of musical scale information were indexed by the late parietal positivity (resembling the P600 of the ERPs) elicited in response to both incongruous pitches in the active experiment only. our results indicate that the relational properties of the musical scale are quickly and automatically extracted by the auditory cortex even before the intervention of focused attention.

Virtually nothing is known about the role of thyroid hormones in the regulation of clock genes responsible for the generation of circadian rhythmicity. To study this issue, we assessed in rats the effect of thyroidectomy/parathyrodectomy (TPX) on the expression of the clock protein, PER2, in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), the master circadian clock, and in a number of key limbic forebrain structures, the oval nucleus of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNSTov), the central nucleus of the amygdala (CEA), the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and the dentate gyrus (DG). TPX significantly altered the normal daily pattern of PER2 expression, in the BNSTov and CEA, but had no effect on PER2 expression in the SCN, BLA and DG. Thus, although thyroid hormones modulate PER2 expression in the brain, the effect is tissue specific and therefore likely not to be mediated by a direct effect of the hormone on gene expression.

How this coding neuronal assembly is configured is debated. We have previously shown that the magnitude of synchronization between excited neurons is stimulus-dependent. In the present investigation we compare the levels of synchronization between synchronizing individual neurons and the synchronizing pool of cells to which they belong. Results: Even though neurons belonged to their respective pools, some cells synchronized for all presented stimuli while others were rather selective and only a few stimulating conditions produced a significant synchronization. In addition the experiments show that one synchronizing pair rarely replicates the level of synchrony between corresponding groups of units. But when synchronizing clusters of neurons increase in number, the correlation ( measured as a coefficient of determination) between unit synchronization and the synchronization between the entire pools of cells to which individual neurons belong improves. Conclusion: These results prompt the hypothesis that random or spontaneous synchronization becomes progressively less important, whereas coincident spikes related to encoding properties of targets gain significance because a particular configuration of an image biases the excitatory inputs in favor of connections driven by the applied features of the stimulus.

Fourteen women (27 +/- 4 yrs; maximal oxygen uptake = 3.12 +/- 0.42 L/min) with minimal arterial PO2 (PaO2) ranging from 76 to 104 mmHg with a maximal alveolar-arterial PO2 difference (AaDO(2)) ranging from 7 to 35 mmHg performed three bouts of near-maximal exercise on a cycle ergometer (236 +/- 27 W) for 5 min each with 10 min of rest between sets. Cardiorespiratory parameters and oxygenation were measured at rest, throughout exercise and recovery. Chest radiographs were obtained before and 30 min after the interval training session (see Respir Physiol Neurobiol, 153 (2006) 181-190). Repeat exercise did not affect pulmonary gas exchange between sets 1 and 3 (change in PaO2 = 3 +/- 2 mmHg; change in AaDO(2) = 1 +/- 2 mmHg P > 0.05). Arterial PCO2 decreased by 4 +/- 2 mmHg (P < 0.05) between sets 1 and 2, which did not reduce further in set 3. The level of PaO2 or AaDO(2) was not related to the change in edema score or the post-exercise edema score (P > 0.05). In conclusion, pulmonary gas exchange is not worsened in women during interval training despite the mild edema triggered by exercise. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The present study investigated the nociceptive effect of AVP in the caudate nucleus (CdN) of the rat. Microinjection of AVP into ;the CdN increased pain threshold in a dose-dependent manner, while local administration of AVP-receptor antagonist-d(CH2)(5)Tyr(Et)DAVP decreased pain threshold. Pain stimulation elevated AVP concentration in CdN perfuse liquid. CdN pretreatment with AVP-receptor antagonist completely reversed AVP's effect on pain threshold in the CdN. The data suggest that AVP in the CdN is involved in antinociception. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Compared with other sequenced insect genomes, the A. mellifera genome has high A+T and CpG contents, lacks major transposon families, evolves more slowly, and is more similar to vertebrates for circadian rhythm, RNA interference and DNA methylation genes, among others. Furthermore, A. mellifera has fewer genes for innate immunity, detoxification enzymes, cuticle-forming proteins and gustatory receptors, more genes for odorant receptors, and novel genes for nectar and pollen utilization, consistent with its ecology and social organization. Compared to Drosophila, genes in early developmental pathways differ in Apis, whereas similarities exist for functions that differ markedly, such as sex determination, brain function and behaviour. Population genetics suggests a novel African origin for the species A. mellifera and insights into whether Africanized bees spread throughout the New World via hybridization or displacement.

In that regard, Hairy/Enhancer of split (Hes) 1 and 5 are basic helix-loop-helix ( bHLH) factors that inhibit the differentiation of pluripotent cortical progenitors into neurons. In contrast, a related Hes family member termed Hes6 promotes neurogenesis. It is shown here that knockdown of endogenous Hes6 causes supernumerary cortical progenitors to differentiate into cells that exhibit an astrocytic morphology and express the astrocyte marker protein GFAP. Conversely, exogenous Hes6 expression in cortical progenitors inhibits astrocyte differentiation. The negative effect of Hes6 on astrocyte differentiation is independent of its ability to promote neuronal differentiation. We also show that neither its proneuronal nor its anti-gliogenic functions appear to depend on Hes6 ability to bind to DNA via the basic arm of its bHLH domain. Both of these activities require Hes6 to be localized to nuclei, but only its anti-gliogenic function depends on two short peptides, LNHLL and WRPW, that are conserved in all Hes6 proteins. These findings suggest that Hes6 is an important regulator of the neurogenic phase of cortical development by promoting the neuronal fate while suppressing astrocyte differentiation. They suggest further that separate molecular mechanisms underlie the proneuronal and anti-gliogenic activities of Hes6 in cortical progenitor cells.

For instance, translation of the uniformly distributed maternal hunchback(hb) mRNA is inhibited at the posterior to form an anterior-to-posterlor protein concentration gradient along the longitudinal axis [5, 6]. Inhibition of hb mRNA translation requires an mRNP complex (the NRE complex), which consists of Nanos (Nos), Pumilio (Pum), and Brain tumor (Brat) proteins, and the Nos responsive element (NRE) present in the 3' UTR of hb mRNA [7-9]. The identity of the mRNA 5' effector protein that is responsible for this translational inhibition remained elusive. Here we show that d4EHP, a cap binding protein that represses caudal (cad) mRNA translation [110], also inhibits hb mRNA translation by interacting simultaneously with the mRNA 5' cap structure (m(7) GpppN, where N is any nucleotide) [11] and Brat. Thus, by regulating Cad and Hb expression, d4EHP plays a key role in establishing anterior-posterior axis polarity in the Drosophila embryo.

Suppression of reactive oxygen species and neurodegeneration by the PGC-1 transcriptional coactivators	CELL			English	Article							CONTROLLING MITOCHONDRIAL BIOGENESIS; HEPATIC GLUCONEOGENESIS; ENDOTHELIAL-CELLS; REDOX REGULATION; PGC-1-ALPHA; MUSCLE; MPTP; DISRUPTION; EXPRESSION; INDUCTION	PPAR gamma coactivator 1 alpha (PGC-1 alpha) is a potent stimulator of mitochondrial biogenesis and respiration. Since the mitochondrial electron transport chain is the main producer of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in most cells, we examined the effect of PGC-1 alpha on the metabolism of ROS. PGC-1 alpha is coinduced with several key ROS-detoxifying enzymes upon treatment of cells with an oxidative stressor; studies with RNAi or null cells indicate that PGC-1 alpha is required for the induction of many ROS-detoxifying enzymes, including GPx1 and SOD2. PGC-1 alpha null mice are much more sensitive to the neurodegenerative effects of MPTP and kainic acid, oxidative stressors affecting the substantia. nigra and hippocampus, respectively. Increasing PGC-1 alpha levels dramatically protects neural cells in culture from oxidative-stressor-mediated death. These studies reveal that PGC-1 alpha is a broad and powerful regulator of ROS metabolism, providing a potential target for the therapeutic manipulation of these important endogenous toxins.

In part, the homeostasis is maintained by monoamine oxidase (MAO) deamination achieved primarily intracellularly. The present study's aim was to examine the effect of the acute administration of the MAO inhibitors, moclobemide (a MAO-A inhibitor) and deprenyl (a MAO-B inhibitor), on 5-HT synthesis rates, measured in discrete regions of the rat brain by an autoradiographic method, using alpha-[C-14]methyl-L-tryptophan as a tracer. MAO inhibitors have different effects on 5-HT synthesis rates in the cell bodies and areas of the nerve terminals. Moclobemide (10 mg/kg, i.p. 30 min before the tracer injection) and deprenyl (3 mg/kg, i.p. 2 h before the tracer injection) decreased the 5-HT synthesis rates in the dorsal (-18% and -22%) and median (-22% and -33%) raphe, respectively. Moclobemide also significantly decreased 5-HT synthesis in the entire nerve terminal areas investigated. The reductions were between 23% (cingulate cortex) and 50% (locus coeruleus). Deprenyl did not significantly affect 5-HT synthesis in the nerve terminals. The present results suggest that MAO-A, and to a lesser extent, MAO-B, are involved in the regulation of 5-HT synthesis in the rat brain. The mechanism(s) of MAO inhibitors' action on 5-HT synthesis in the raphe nuclei are probably related to an increase in the extraneuronal 5-HT concentration and also to the interaction between the serotonergic and catecholaminergic neurons. The reduction of 5-HT synthesis in the raphe nuclei likely occurs by an action of extracellular 5-HT via the dendritic autoreceptors with a possible contribution from the action of extracellular DA and NE. In the terminal regions, the most likely mechanism is via the presynaptic autoreceptors through which elevated extraneuronal 5-HT acts on synthesis control. However, there is also a possibility that the elevation in intraneuronal 5-HT directly inhibits its synthesis, especially following deprenyl treatment. A great influence of moclobemide on 5-HT synthesis could be related to its antidepressant action. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Idiopathic RBD frequently herald an alpha-synucleinopathy, including such as Parkinson's disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy Body (DLB). Pathological changes in the anterior olfactory nucleus and olfactory loss occur very early in the course of PD and DLB. The aim of the study was to assess olfactory function in a large group of idiopathic RBD patients. Methods: Fifty-four consecutive polysomnographically-confirmed iRBD patients (44 men, 10 women; mean age: 69.2 8.3 years; mean Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale Part III (UPDRS-III) score: 4.9 +/- 4.3) and 54 age and gender-matched control subjects underwent the Brief University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (B-SIT). Results: A marked olfactory impairment was observed in the RBD group (mean B-SIT score: 7.1 +/- 2.5 versus 9.4 +/- 1.8; p < 0.0001), with 33 (61.1%) RBD patients versus 9 (16.6%) controls showing abnormal olfactory function (p < 0.0001). No correlation was found between the degree of olfactory loss and either duration of RBD symptoms or UPDRS-III score. Deficit in recognize paint thinner odorant showed the highest positive predictive value (0.95) for identifying idiopathic RBD. Conclusions: The olfactory deficit found in most idiopathic RBD patients shares similarities with that described in PD and may be a sign of a widespread neurodegenerative process. Its detection may help in identifying subjects at higher risk of developing an alpha-synucleinopathy-mediated neurodegeneration. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Although cognitive-behavioral therapy is effective in patients with panic disorder, its therapeutic mechanism of action in the brain remains unclear. The present study was performed to investigate regional brain glucose metabolic changes associated with successful completion of cognitive-behavioral therapy in panic disorder patients. The regional glucose utilization in patients with panic disorder was compared before and after cognitive-behavioral therapy using positron emission tomography with F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose. In 11 of 12 patients who showed improvement after cognitive-behavioral therapy, decreased glucose utilization was detected in the right hippocampus, left anterior cingulate, left cerebellum, and pons, whereas increased glucose utilization was seen in the bilateral medial prefrontal cortices. Significant correlations were found between the percent change relative to the pretreatment value of glucose utilization in the left medial prefrontal cortex and those of anxiety and agoraphobia-related subscale of the Panic Disorder Severity Scale, and between that of the midbrain and that of the number of panic attacks during the 4 weeks before each scan in all 12 patients. The completion of successful cognitive-behavioral therapy involved not only reduction of the baseline hyperactivity in several brain areas but also adaptive metabolic changes of the bilateral medial prefrontal cortices in panic disorder patients.

To investigate the regional brain metabolic consequences of this combined pathology, cytochrome oxidase (CO) activity was measured by histochemistry from brain regions of wild-type and homozygous Girk2(Wv) mutant mice and correlated with motor performances. CO activity of Girk2(Wv) mutants was abnormal in cerebellar cortex, dentate nucleus, and brainstem regions (medial and lateral vestibular nuclei, prepositus, superior colliculus, lateral cuneiform nucleus, and reticular nuclei) implicated in the gaze system. CO activity increased in midbrain dopaminergic regions after correcting for tissue density, regions with severe depletion of tyrosine hydroxylase activity. Forebrain regions were relatively spared in term of CO activity, except for subthalamic nucleus, lateral geniculate nucleus, and cortical eye field. Similarly to the Rora(sg) cerebellar mutant, metabolic alterations in cerebellar and vestibular regions were linearly correlated with poor motor coordination, underlining the sensitivity of these tests to cerebellar dysfunction.

However, the behavioral relevance of sensory bursts has not been established in any system. Here, we show that bursts in an identified auditory interneuron of crickets reliably signal salient stimulus features and reliably predict behavioral responses.

Somatosensory precision in speech production	CURRENT BIOLOGY			English	Article							UNSTABLE DYNAMICS; JAW STIFFNESS; ADAPTATION; IMPEDANCE	Speech production is dependent on both auditory and somatosensory feedback [1-3]. Although audition may appear to be the dominant sensory modality in speech production, somatosensory information plays a role that extends from brainstem responses to cortical control [4-6]. Accordingly, the motor commands that underlie speech movements may have somatosensory as well as auditory goals [7]. Here we provide evidence that, independent of the acoustics, somatosensory information is central to achieving the precision requirements of speech movements. We were able to dissociate auditory and somatosensory feedback by using a robotic device that altered the jaw's motion path, and hence proprioception, without affecting speech acoustics. The loads were designed to target either the consonant- or vowel-related portion of an utterance because these are the major sound categories in speech. We found that, even in the absence of any effect on the acoustics, with learning subjects corrected to an equal extent for both kinds of loads. This finding suggests that there are comparable somatosensory precision requirements for both kinds of speech sounds. We provide experimental evidence that the neural control of stiffness or impedance-the resistance to displacement-provides for somatosensory precision in speech production [8-10].

Genetic contributions to human brain morphology and intelligence	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						genetics; twins; neuroanatomy; voxel-based morphometry; intelligence; cognition	MATTER DENSITY CHANGES; ADULT HUMAN BRAINS; GENERAL INTELLIGENCE; NEURAL MECHANISMS; WHITE-MATTER; TWIN; VARIABILITY; ASYMMETRY; CORTEX; GRAY	Variation in gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) volume of the adult human brain is primarily genetically determined. Moreover, total brain volume is positively correlated with general intelligence, and both share a common genetic origin. However, although genetic effects on morphology of specific GM areas in the brain have been studied, the heritability of focal WM is unknown. Similarly, it is unresolved whether there is a common genetic origin of focal GM and WM structures with intelligence. We explored the genetic influence on focal GM and WM densities in magnetic resonance brain images of 54 monozygotic and 58 dizygotic twin pairs and 34 of their siblings. For genetic analyses, we used structural equation modeling and voxel-based morphometry. To explore the common genetic origin of focal GM and WM areas with intelligence, we obtained cross-trait/cross-twin correlations in which the focal GM and WM densities of each twin are correlated with the psychometric intelligence quotient of his/her cotwin. Genes influenced individual differences in left and right superior occipitofrontal fascicle (heritability up to 0.79 and 0.77), corpus callosum (0.82, 0.80), optic radiation (0.69, 0.79), corticospinal tract (0.78, 0.79), medial frontal cortex ( 0.78, 0.83), superior frontal cortex (0.76, 0.80), superior temporal cortex (0.80, 0.77), left occipital cortex (0.85), left postcentral cortex (0.83), left posterior cingulate cortex (0.83), right parahippocampal cortex (0.69), and amygdala (0.80, 0.55). Intelligence shared a common genetic origin with superior occipitofrontal, callosal, and left optical radiation WM and frontal, occipital, and parahippocampal GM (phenotypic correlations up to 0.35). These findings point to a neural network that shares a common genetic origin with human intelligence.

To investigate the role of PC2 in nociception and analgesia, we tested wild-type and PC2-null mice for their responses to mechanical and thermal nociceptive stimuli, before and after a short swim in cold or warm water. Basal responses and responses after a cold swim were similar between the two groups. However, after a short forced swim in warm water, PC2-null mice were significantly less responsive to the stimuli than wild-type mice, an indication of increased opioid-mediated stress-induced analgesia. The enhanced analgesia in PC2-null mice may be caused by an accumulation of opioid precursor processing intermediates with potent analgesic effects, or by loss of anti-opioid peptides.

J	Boyarsky, A; Gora, P				Boyarsky, Abraham; Gora, Pawel			Invariant measures in brain dynamics	PHYSICS LETTERS A			English	Article						neural ensemble; mathematical framework; deterministic chaotic dynamics; invariant measures; consciousness		This note concerns brain activity at the level of neural ensembles and uses ideas from ergodic dynamical systems to model and characterize chaotic patterns among these ensembles during conscious mental activity. Central to our model is the definition of a space of neural ensembles and the assumption of discrete time ensemble dynamics. We argue that continuous invariant measures draw the attention of deeper brain processes, engendering emergent properties such as consciousness. Invariant measures supported on a finite set of ensembles reflect periodic behavior, whereas the existence of continuous invariant measures reflect the dynamics of nonrepeating ensemble patterns that elicit the interest of deeper mental processes. We shall consider two different ways to achieve continuous invariant measures on the space of neural ensembles: (1) via quantum jitters, and (2) via sensory input accompanied by inner thought processes which engender a "folding" property on the space of ensembles.

Because dysfunction of EL system is associated with a variety of neurodegenerative disorders, it is possible that the CI-MPR may have a role in regulating neuronal viability after toxicity/injury. In the present study, we report that 192-IgG-saporin-induced loss of basal fore-brain cholinergic neurons causes a transient upregulation of CI-MPR protein levels in surviving neurons of the basal forebrain and frontal cortex but not in the brainstem region, which was relatively spared by the immunotoxin. This was accompanied by a parallel time-dependent increase in other EL markers, ie, cathepsin D, Rab5, and LAMP2 in the basal forebrain region, whereas in the frontal cortex the levels of cathepsin D, and to some extent Rab5, were increased. Given the critical role of the EL system in the clearance of abnormal proteins in response to changing conditions, it is likely that the observed increase in the CI-MPR and components of the EL system in surviving neurons after 192-IgG-saporin treatment represents an adaptive mechanism to restore the metabolic/structural abnormalities induced by the loss of cholinergic neurons.

Nephron number varies widely among normal humans and those who are born at the low end of the nephron number spectrum may be at risk for essential hypertension in adulthood. Little is known about how nephron number is set. However, we previously showed that the transcription factor, Pax2, suppresses apoptosis in UB cells during kidney development and optimizes branching morphogenesis. Here, we report that PAX2 directly binds to a specific recognition motif in the human neuronal apoptosis inhibitory protein (NAIP) gene promoter. NAIP is an endogenous inhibitor of apoptosis, inactivating caspase-3 and caspase-7 in neuronal tissues. PAX2 activates NAIP gene transcription (7-fold) in vitro and NAIP transcript level is increased fourfold in HEK293 cells stably transfected with PAX2. We show that Naip is expressed in embryonic day 15 (E15) fetal kidney tissue (RT-PCR) and NAIP protein is demonstrated by immunohistochemistry in E15 mouse kidney collecting ducts and P1 proximal tubules. Naip mRNA is significantly reduced (50%) in heterozygous Pax2 mutant mice. Finally, we show that an antisense Naip1 cDNA transfected into murine collecting duct cells doubles caspase-3/7 activity induced by Bax alpha. These observations suggest that the powerful effects of PAX2 on renal branching morphogenesis and final nephron number may be mediated by activation of Naip which then suppresses apoptosis in UB cells.

Altered CD4(+)/CD8(+) T-cell ratios in cerebrospinal fluid of natalizumab-treated patients with multiple sclerosis	ARCHIVES OF NEUROLOGY			English	Article							PROGRESSIVE MULTIFOCAL LEUKOENCEPHALOPATHY; JC VIRUS-DNA; PERIPHERAL-BLOOD; CONTROLLED TRIAL; INFECTION; SUBSETS; LYMPHOCYTES; INTEGRIN; DISEASE; BRAIN	Background: Treatment with natalizumab, a monoclonal antibody against the adhesion molecule very late activation antigen 4, an alpha 4 beta(1) integrin, was recently associated with the development of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, a demyelinating disorder of the central nervous system caused by JC virus infection. Objective: To test the effect of natalizumab treatment on the CD4(+)/CD8(+) T-cell ratios in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and peripheral blood. Design: Prospective longitudinal study. Setting: Academic and private multiple sclerosis centers. Patients: Patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) treated with natalizumab, untreated patients with MS, patients with other neurologic diseases, and human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients. Main Outcome Measures: CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells were enumerated in CSF and peripheral blood. The mean fluorescence intensity of unbound alpha 4 integrin on peripheral blood CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells was analyzed before and after natalizumab therapy. Results: Natalizumab therapy decreased the CSF CD4(+)/CD8(+) ratio of patients with MS to levels similar to those of human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients. CD4(+)/CD8(+) ratios in peripheral blood in patients with MS progressively decreased with the number of natalizumab doses, but they remained within normal limits. Six months after the cessation of natalizumab therapy, CSF CD4(+)/CD8(+) ratios normalized. The expression of unbound alpha 4 integrin on peripheral blood T cells decreases with natalizumab therapy and was significantly lower on CD4(+) vs CD8(+) T cells. Conclusions: Natalizumab treatment alters the CSF CD4(+)/CD8(+) ratio. Lower expression of unbound alpha 4 integrin on CD4(+) T cells is one possible mechanism. These results may have implications for the observation that some natalizumab-treated patients with MS developed progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy.

DNA methylation is an epigenetic modification of DNA that is implicated in the regulation of imprinted genes. Genes subject to genomic imprinting are expressed monoallelically in a parent of origin-dependent manner and are important for embryo growth, placental function, and neurobehavioral processes. The vast majority of imprinted genes have been studied in mice and humans. Herein, our objectives were to characterize the bovine SNRPN gene in gametes and to compare its methylation profile in in vivo-produced, in vitro-produced, and SCNT-derived Day 17 elongating embryos. A CpG island within the 5' region of SNRPN was identified and examined using bisulfite sequencing. SNRPN alleles were unmethylated in sperm, methylated in oocytes, and approximately 50% methylated in somatic samples. The examined SNRPN region appeared for the most part to be normally methylated in three in vivo-produced Day 17 embryos and in eight in vitro-produced Day 17 embryos examined, while alleles from Day 17 SCNT embryos were severely hypomethylated in seven of eight embryos. In this study, we showed that the SNRPN methylation profiles previously observed in mouse and human studies are also conserved in cattle. Moreover, SCNT-derived Day 17 elongating embryos were abnormally hypomethylated compared with in vivo-produced and in vitro-produced embryos, which in turn suggests that SCNT may lead to faulty reprogramming or maintenance of methylation imprints at this locus.

To this aim, voxel-based morphometry was used to detect brain anatomical differences in amusic individuals relative to musically intact controls, by analysing T-1-weighted magnetic resonance images from two independent samples of subjects. The results were consistent across samples in highlighting a reduction in white matter concentration in the right inferior frontal gyrus of amusic individuals. This anatomical anomaly was correlated with performance on pitch-based musical tasks. The results are consistent with neuroimaging findings implicating right inferior frontal regions in musical pitch encoding and melodic pitch memory. We conceive the present results as a consequence of an impoverished communication in a right-hemisphere-based network involving the inferior frontal cortex and the right auditory cortex. Moreover, the data point to the integrity of white matter tracts in right frontal brain areas as being key in acquiring normal musical competence.

BRAIN			English	Article						aphasia; singing; speech; melodic intonation therapy; music	MELODIC INTONATION THERAPY; DYSARTHRIC SPEAKERS; AUTOMATIC SPEECH; LEFT-HEMISPHERE; MUSIC; MEMORY; INTELLIGIBILITY; BRAIN; SONGS; TEXT	A classic observation in neurology is that aphasics can sing words they cannot pronounce otherwise. To further assess this claim, we investigated the production of sung and spoken utterances in eight brain-damaged patients suffering from a variety of speech disorders as a consequence of a left-hemisphere lesion. In Experiment 1, the patients were tested in the repetition and recall of words and notes of familiar material. Lyrics of familiar songs, as well as words of proverbs and prayers, were not better pronounced in singing than in speaking. Notes were better produced than words. In Experiment 2, the aphasic patients repeated and recalled lyrics from novel songs. Again, they did not produce more words in singing than in speaking. In Experiment 3, when allowed to sing or speak along with an auditory model while learning novel songs, aphasics repeated and recalled more words when singing than when speaking. Reduced speed or shadowing cannot account for this advantage of singing along over speaking in unison. The results suggest that singing in synchrony with an auditory model-choral singing-is more effective than choral speech, at least in French, in improving word intelligibility because choral singing may entrain more than one auditory-vocal interface. Thus, choral singing appears to be an effective means of speech therapy.

But under certain circumstances, music can also be unpleasant, for example, when a young child randomly hits piano keys. Such unpleasant musical experiences have been shown to activate a network of brain structures involved in emotion, mostly located in the medial temporal lobe: the parahippocampal gyrus, amygdala, hippocampus and temporal pole. However, the differential roles of these regions remain largely unknown. In this study, pleasant and unpleasant music was presented to 17 patients with variable excisions of the medial temporal lobe, as well as to 19 matched controls. The pleasant music corresponded to happy and sad selections taken from the classical instrumental repertoire; the unpleasant music was the dissonant arrangement of the same selections. Only patients with substantial resections of the left or right parahippocampal cortex (PHC) gave highly abnormal judgements to dissonant music; they rated dissonant music as slightly pleasant while controls found it unpleasant. This indifference to dissonance was correlated with the remaining volume in the PHC, but was unrelated to the volume of the surrounding structures. The impairment was specific: the same patients judged consonant music to be pleasant, and were able to judge music as happy or sad. Furthermore, this lack of responsiveness to unpleasantness was not due to a perceptual disorder, because all patients were able to detect intentional errors in the musical excerpts. Moreover, the impairment differed from that induced by amygdala damage alone. These findings are consistent with a two-dimensional model of defensive responses to aversive stimuli, in which the PHC and the amygdala subserve different roles.

Recommended practice is based mainly on levels II and III evidence. MAIN MESSAGE Feeding problems are classified under structural abnormalities, neurodevelopmental disabilities, and behavioural disorders, with overlap between categories. A medical approach also needs an evaluation of diet and an assessment of the interaction between parent and child. Treating medical or surgical conditions, increasing caloric intake, and counseling about general nutrition can alleviate mild to moderate problems. More complicated cases should be referred to multidisciplinary teams. Behavioural therapy aims to foster appropriate behaviour and discourage maladaptive behaviour. CONCLUSION Feeding problems in early childhood often have multifactorial causes and a substantial behavioural component. Family physicians have a key role in detecting problems, offering advice, managing mildly to moderately severe cases, and referring more complicated cases to multidisciplinary teams.

Different, but not mutually exclusive, models of corticostriatal connectivity have been proposed, including connectivity based on proximity, parallel loops, and a model of a tripartite division of the striatum into motor, associative, and limbic areas. All these models were largely based on studies of anatomic connectivity in nonhuman mammals and lesion studies in animals and humans. Functional neuroimaging has the potential to discern patterns of functional connectivity in humans in vivo. We analyzed the functional connectivity between the cortex and the striatum in a meta-analysis of 126 published functional neuroimaging studies. We mapped the peak activations listed in each publication into stereotaxic space and used standard functional imaging statistical methods to determine which cortical areas were most likely to coactivate with different parts of the striatum. The patterns of functional connectivity between the cortex and the different striatal nuclei are broadly consistent with the predictions of the parallel loop model. The rostrocaudal and dorsoventral patterns of corticostriatal functional connectivity are consistent with the tripartite division of the striatum into motor, associative, and limbic zones.

By utilizing individual differences in perceived quality of the odor of androstenone, we obtained a continuum of individual differences in rated valence of the same stimulus allowing investigations of its manifestation in the olfactory event-related potentials (ERPs). In an initial group consisting of 43 individuals that were screened for their verbal descriptors and sensitivity for the odor of androstenone, 22 normosmic volunteers were chosen forming 2 distinct groups with regard to verbal labels ("body odor" and "nonbody odor") for androstenone while maintaining chemical structure, concentration, and intensity constant. In the main experiment, these participants rated both intensity and pleasantness of androstenone during the recording of olfactory ERPs. There was a significant difference in rated valence between the groups but not in intensity. Participants in the body odor label group had larger amplitudes of the late positive ERP component than those in the nonbody odor label group. A negative correlation between valence and amplitudes of the late positive component for androstenone indicated that these differences were mediated by the difference in odor valence between the 2 groups. This was further supported by a comparison of ERP peaks in response to stimulation with androstenone and the invariably unpleasant hydrogen sulfide that had been used as a control. Altogether, the results suggest that the late positive component reflects the processing of odor valence. Future olfactory studies with the aim of assessing the dimension of pleasantness would benefit from the use of these interindividual differences in the perception of a specific odor.

The aim of this study was to use event-related potentials (ERP) to further document the attentional impairments in these patients. Methods: Twelve OSAS patients and 12 age-matched controls underwent the ERP task which consisted in the presentation of short (50 ms, 50%) and long tones (400 ms, 50%). For these two categories, 90% were standard (1000 Hz) and 10% were deviant tones (750 or 1250 Hz). Subjects had to discriminate short and long tones by a motor response. Results: OSAS patients had a sustained and delayed P300 in comparison with control subjects following standard tones (p < 0.05). A reduction in amplitude was found in OSAS patients for the P3a obtained by the subtraction of standard from deviant tones (p < 0.05). No group difference was observed for NI, mismatch negativity and reorienting negativity components. Conclusions: Apneas and hypopneas produce deficits related to involuntary attentional switch and stimulus classification processing. Significance: The changes observed in P3a and P300 components further support the hypothesis that attentional deficits play a pivotal role in cognitive deficits noted in OSAS.

J	Levine, MD; Yu, YF				Levine, Martin David; Yu, Yingfeng			Face recognition subject to variations in facial expression, illumination and pose using correlation filters	COMPUTER VISION AND IMAGE UNDERSTANDING			English	Article						correlation filter; recognition; verification; energy peak; face recognition; phase-only	DISCRIMINANT-ANALYSIS	In this paper, we have selected some recent advanced correlation filters: minimum average correlation filter (MACE), unconstrained MACE filter (UMACE), phase-only unconstrained MACE filter (POUMACE), distance-classifier correlation filter (DCCF) [B.V.K. Vijaya Kumar, D. Casasent, A. Mahalanobis, Distance-classifier correlation filters for multiclass target recognition. Appl. Opt. 35 (1996) 3127-3133] and minimax distance transform correlation filter (MDTC) and used them to test recognition performance in different situations involving variations in facial expression, illumination conditions and head pose. The paper introduces the first application of correlation filter classifiers to facial images subject to head pose variations. It also demonstrates that it is possible to obtain illumination invariance without using any training images for this purpose. A comparison of MDTC with traditional discriminant learning methods (e.g., KPCA [Scholikopf, B., Smola, A., Muller, K.R., Nonlinear component analysis as a kernel eigenvalue problem. Neural Comput., 10 (1999) 1299-1319], IPCA [16], GDA [Baudat, G., Anouar, F., Generalized discriminant analysis using a kernel approach. Neural Comput., 12 (2000) 2385 2404], R-KDA [Lu, J., Plataniotis, K., Venetsanopoulos, A. Regularization studies of linear discriminant analysis in small sample size scenarios with application to face recognition. Pattern Recogn. Lett., 26(2) (2005) 181-191]) is also presented. The paper shows that correlation filter classifiers, a relatively unheralded model-based approach, have a greater robustness and accuracy than traditional appearance-based methods (such as PCA). Overall, the POUMACE filter provided the best choice for facial matching. It achieved 100% accuracy on the publicly available CMU facial expression database and the Yale frontal face illumination database, and slightly less in the head pose experiments.

When a diffusible axon guidance cue stops diffusing: roles for netrins in adhesion and morphogenesis	CURRENT OPINION IN NEUROBIOLOGY			English	Review							GROWTH CONE GUIDANCE; SPINAL-CORD; FILOPODIA FORMATION; COMMISSURAL AXONS; GENETIC-ANALYSIS; CELL-ADHESION; RECEPTOR DCC; KINASE; FAMILY; DROSOPHILA	Netrins are a small family of secreted proteins that are best known for their role as secreted long-range chemotropic guidance cues. Extracellular gradients of netrin protein, established by diffusion, are thought to direct cell and axon migration during neural development. In addition to this long-range role, recent findings provide increasing support for short-range functions, in which secreted netrin protein remains closely associated with its cellular source. Emerging evidence for short-range actions of netrins suggests that they contribute to tissue morphogenesis by regulating cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion.

Laminar organization of the early developing anterior hypothalamus	DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY			English	Article						Sim1; hypothalamus; development; mice; microarray; transcription factor	PROGENITOR CELLS; NEURONS ARISE; FACTOR BRN-2; MOUSE; SIM1; GENE; EXPRESSION; LINEAGES; PATTERNS; MICE	The bHLH-PAS transcription factor SIM1 is required for the development of neurons of the anterior hypothalamus (AH). In order to dissect this developmental program, we compared gene expression in the AH of E12.5 Sim1(+/+) and Sim1(-/-) littermates using an oligonucleotide-based microarray. Our analysis identified 48 genes that were downregulated and 8 genes that were upregulated. We examined the expression pattern of 10 of the identified genes - Cart, Cbln1, Alcam, Urzc-13c, Rgs4, Lnx4, Irx3, Sax1, Ldb2 and Neurod6 - by in situ hybridization in E12.5 embryos. All of these genes are expressed in domains that are contained within that of Sim1 and their expression is changed in Sim1(-/-) embryos as predicted by the microarray analysis. Classical dating studies have established that the hypothalamus follows an "outside-in" pattern of neurogenesis, with neurons of the lateral hypothalamus being born before the medial ones. Analysis of the genes identified in this microarray study showed that the developing AH is characterized by different layers of gene expression that most likely correspond to distinct waves of neurogenesis. In addition, our analysis suggests that Sim1 function is required for the production or the survival of postmitotic neurons as well as for correct positioning of AH neurons. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Objective: To assess the role of DA in nicotine craving and self-administration using acute phenylalanine/tyrosine depletion (APTD). Methods: Fifteen nicotine-dependent men ingested, a minimum of 3 days apart, a nutritionally balanced amino acid (AA) mixture (BAL), a mixture deficient in the catecholamine precursors, phenylalanine and tyrosine, and APTD followed by the immediate DA precursor, L-DOPA. Beginning 3h after ingestion of the AA mixture, subjects smoked 4 cigarettes. Craving, mood, and other aspects of subjective state were assessed with self-report scales. Smoking puff topography was measured with a computerized flowmeter. Results: APTD did not change smoking puff topography, cigarette craving, or subjective effects of smoking. Conclusions: The findings suggest that in nicotine-dependent smokers craving for cigarettes, subjective effects of nicotine, and the self-administration of freely available cigarettes are largely unrelated to acute changes in DA neurotransmission.

Using quantitative immunolabeling with the PGP9.5 antibody, we have investigated whether these painful neuropathies might be associated with degeneration that is confined to the region of the sensory fiber's receptor terminals in the skin. Because complete and partial nerve transections are known to cause an increase in PGP9.5 in epidermal Langerhans cells (LCs), we also examined whether this effect occurs in chemotherapy-treated animals. At the time of peak pain severity, rats with paclitaxel- and vincristine-evoked painful peripheral neuropathies had a significant decrease (24% and 44%, respectively) in the number of intraepidermal nerve fibers (IENF) in the hind paw glabrous skin and an increase (217% and 121%, respectively) in the number of PGP9.5-positive LCs, relative to control. However, neither loss of IENF nor an increase in PGP9.5-positive LCs was found in rats with a painful peripheral neuropathy evoked by the anti-HIV agent, 2',3'-dideoxycytidine. We also confirmed that there is a decrease in IENF and an increase in PGP9.5-positive LCs in rats with neuropathic pain following a partial nerve injury (CCI model) and in rats with a complete sciatic nerve transection. Partial degeneration of the intraepidermal innervation suggests mechanisms that might produce chemotherapy-evoked neuropathic pain, and activation of cutaneous LCs suggests possible neuroimmune interactions that might also have a role.

Status epilepticus (SE) induces temporal lobe epileptogenesis following a latent period in which glial cells are activated. Here, we found that P450scc, the rate-limiting enzyme in steroid synthesis.. is upregulated in hippocampal glia during the latent period after pilocarpine-induced SE in rats. More prolonged SE was associated with greater P450scc expression and longer latencies to the development of seizures, suggesting that enhanced steroid synthesis retards epileptogenesis. The 5 alpha-reductase inhibitor finasteride, which blocks neurosteroid synthesis, reduced the latent period, indicating that glia-derived neurosteroids may be antiepileptogenic.

This review will summarize the major in vivo defects that result from the disruption of the expression of their genes. This includes abnormal embryonic development, hormonal disorder, infertility, and/or modified lipid/sterol metabolism. Members of the PC family play a central role in the processing of various protein precursors ranging from hormones and growth factors to bacterial toxins and viral glycoproteins. Proteolysis occurring at basic residues is mediated by the basic amino acid-specific proprotein convertases, namely: PC1/3, PC2, furin, PACE4, PC4, PC5/6, and PC7. In contrast, proteolysis at nonbasic residues is performed by the subtilisin/kexin-like isozyme-1 (SKI-1/S1P) and the newly identified neural apoptosis-regulated convertase-1 (PCSK9/NARC-1). In addition to their requirement for many physiological processes, these enzymes are also involved in various pathologies such as cancer, obesity, diabetes, lipid disorders, infectious diseases, atherosclerosis and neurodegenerative diseases.

J	Montoya, A; Price, BH; Lepage, M				Montoya, Alonso; Price, Bruce H.; Lepage, Martin			Neural correlates of 'functional' symptoms in neurology	FUNCTIONAL NEUROLOGY			English	Review						functional neuroimaging; functional symptoms; hysteria; neural correlates; neuroimaging	PSYCHOGENIC PARKINSONISM; DISEASE; CONVERSION; DISORDERS; MOVEMENT; HYSTERIA	Functional symptoms are neurological deficits that are not explained by organic lesions in the nervous system, but usually associated with emotional "psychogenic" disturbances. These symptoms are common and can affect any aspect of elementary neurological function, presenting clinicians with difficulties in definition, diagnosis, and treatment. Although current concepts explain functional symptoms in the context of "psychogenic" stress, the exact nature of these symptoms remains largely unknown. Recent functional neuroimaging studies have shifted understanding of these deficits from a psychological and psychodynamic model to a neurobiological model. This review highlights the advances made using functional neuroimaging techniques in patients suffering from two conditions: unilateral loss of motor function and psychogenic parkinsonism. The evidence suggests that areas including the prefrontal and parietal cortices, anterior cingulate cortex, thalamus, and basal ganglia may be implicated. Future studies, assessing patients at different phases of their illness and using newer techniques such as functional MRI, are needed to extend current findings on functional symptoms.

In a screen for potential regulators of kidney development, we have identified Pcdh19, a poorly characterized member of the 8-protocadherin subfamily. Here, we report the spatio-temporal expression pattern of Pcdh19 during mouse embryonic development. In midgestation embryos, Pcdh19 mRNA was detected in the mesonephros and in the neuroepithelium of the forebrain and midbrain. At later stages, Pcdh19 was expressed in other neural tissues such as the neural retina, nasal epithelium and spinal cord, as well as in the collecting duct and differentiating nephrons of the metanephros, in the glandular stomach, the exocrine pancreas and the hair follicles. Hence, the Pcdh19 gene is developmentally regulated during mouse organogenesis and shows a unique expression profile among protocadherins. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In vitro, these cells were reported to clonally proliferate and generate pigmented sphere colonies (PSC) containing multipotent retinal progenitor-like cells. Because these cells may have important clinical applications and because their embryonic origin is unclear, we have analyzed their local environment and gene expression profile. We found that transcription factors Pax6, Six3, and Rx, all involved in early eye morphogenesis, were expressed in the CB of adult mice. By sequencing a PSC cDNA library, we found that PSC expressed at high levels transcripts involved in the control of redox metabolism and cellular proliferation. PSC also expressed the retinal transcription factor Six6, which expression was not detected in the CB epithelium. By in situ hybridization screen, we found that Palmdelphin (Palm), Hmga2, and a novel transcript were expressed in the central nervous system of early embryos. Palm expression delineated the pigmented epithelium of the future CB and the developing myotome. Hmga2 was expressed in the ventricular zone of the telencephalon, the developing retinal ciliary margin and lens. Several genes expressed in PSC were also expressed in the nasal anlagen. Taken together, our study reveals that PSC isolated from the ocular CB express genes involved in the control of embryonic development, retinal identity, redox metabolism, and cellular proliferation.

This paper outlines a family of models, derived from the Kinematic Theory of Human Movements. It explains how the nested models in this family can be used coherently, in the context of a multi-level representation paradigm, to analyze both the trajectory and the velocity of strokes with a progressive amount of detail. In the context of a comprehensive survey of previously published work, this paper highlights many new features of stroke production, when the vectorial version of the theory is fully exploited. In this perspective, the Kinematic Theory is depicted as a potential tool to facilitate communications among researchers working in the multi-disciplinary field of Graphonomics.

J	Kandil, N; Wamkeue, R; Saad, M; Georges, S				Kandil, Nahi; Wamkeue, Rene; Saad, Maarouf; Georges, Semaan			An efficient approach for short term load forecasting using artificial neural networks	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL POWER & ENERGY SYSTEMS			English	Article						power systems; load forecasting; artificial neural networks		In previous work, we applied artificial neural networks (ANN) for short term load forecasting using real load and weather data from the Hydro-Quebec databases where three types of variables were used as inputs to the neural network: (a) hour and day indicators, (b) weather related inputs and (c) historical loads. In general, for forecasting with a lead time of up to a few days ahead, load history (for the last few days) is not available, and therefore, estimated values of this load are used instead. However, a small error in these estimated values may grow up dramatically and lead to a serious problem in load forecasting since this error is fed back as an input to the forecasting procedure. In this paper, we demonstrate ANN capabilities in load forecasting without the use of load history as an input.

Method A one-year prospective study of resource utilization recorded monthly by 500 caregivers of community dwelling patients with dementia. The effect of behavior on total, direct and indirect costs of care was examined. Results The total cost of care was $1,298 per month and there was a significant independent relationship between costs and BPSD. The incremental cost of a one point increase in Neuropsychiatric Inventory score was $30 per month (95% CI: $19-$41). Conclusion BPSD contribute significantly to the overall costs of dementia care. Interventions targeted at BPSD may help to reduce the staggering societal costs of this illness. Copyright (c) 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Inasmuch as topiramate and valproate, which are currently used for aggressive behavior, share several pharmacological mechanisms (positive modulatory effect on the GABA activity and negative modulatory effect on glutamatergic neurotransmission), the objective of the present study was to compare the pharmacological effects of topiramate with those of valproate and their combination in patients with psychiatric disorders showing marked aggression and agitation. A retrospective, case-controlled, mirror-image study was carried out in a sample of 45 inpatients affected by schizophrenia, schizoaffective and bipolar disorder, and hospitalized in a maximum-security Canadian psychiatry hospital. Overt Aggression Scale, Agitation-Calmness Evaluation Scale, number and intensity of psychotic episodes, number of episodes of withdrawal from group activities per week, and number of therapeutic isolation per week and of strict surveillance intervention per week were evaluated before and after the treatments. Results indicate that patients treated with topiramate show a decrease in the average score of the Overt Aggression Scale, a decrease of episodes of agitation and of strict surveillance interventions. This effect was similar to the group treated with valproate or with the combination of valproate-topiramate. However, valproate therapy, but not topiramate therapy, decreased the intensity of agitation episodes measured by the Agitation-Calmness Evaluation Scale; valproate and the combination topiramate-valproate decreased the number of psychotic disorganization episodes as well. These results suggest that topiramate could be a valid medicine in the control of aggression in psychosis. Double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled studies need to further assess this pharmacological indication.

Differentiation of group I and group II strains of Clostridium botulinum by focal plane array Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy	JOURNAL OF FOOD PROTECTION			English	Article							FIELD GEL-ELECTROPHORESIS; GENUS CLOSTRIDIUM; FTIR SPECTROSCOPY; IDENTIFICATION; DISCRIMINATION; MICROORGANISMS; CLASSIFICATION; PHYLOGENY; DIVERSITY; BACTERIA	A method was developed for whole-organism fingerprinting of Clostridium botulinum isolates by focal plane array Fourier transform infrared (FPA-FTIR) spectroscopy. A database of 150,000 infrared spectra of 44 strains of C. botulinum was acquired using a FPA-FTIR imaging spectrometer equipped with a 16 X 16 array detector to evaluate the ability of FTIR spectroscopy to differentiate the 44 strains. The database contained strains from C. botulinum groups I and 11 producing botulinum neurotoxin of serotypes A, B, E, and F All strains were grown on each of three agar media (brain heart infusion, McClung Toabe agar base, and universal) prior to spectral acquisition. Given the dependence of the infrared spectra of microorganisms on the composition of the growth medium, the spectra were initially separated into three subsets corresponding to the three growth media employed. However, the replicate spectra of all strains, regardless of growth medium, were properly clustered by hierarchical cluster analysis based on differences in their infrared spectral profiles in three narrow spectral regions (1,428 to 1,412, 1,296 to 1,284, and 1,112 to 1, 100 cm(-1)). The dendrogram generated from the FTIR data revealed complete separation between group I and group II strains. The spectral differences between group I and group II strains allowed accurate classification of C. botulinum strains at the group level in two blind validation studies (n = 40). These results demonstrate that FPA-FTIR spectroscopy has the potential for rapid discrimination of group I and group 11 C botulinum strains in less than 3 min per sample.

Previous studies have documented gene and protein expression of P-gp in brain microvessel endothelial cells. However, the exact localization of P-gp, particularly at the abluminal side of the BBB, remains controversial. In the present study we examined the cellular/sub-cellular distribution of P-gp in situ in rat and human brain tissues using immunogold cytochemistry at the electron microscope level. P-gp localizes to both the luminal and abluminal membranes of capillary endothelial cells as well as to adjacent pericytes and astrocytes. Sub-cellularly, P-gp is distributed along the nuclear envelope, in caveolae, cytoplasmic vesicles, Golgi complex, and rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER). These results provide evidence for the expression of P-gp in human and rodent brain capillary along their plasma membranes as well as at sites of protein synthesis, glycosylation, and membrane trafficking. In addition, its presence at the luminal and abluminal poles of the BBB, including pericytes and astrocyte plasma membranes, suggests that this glycoprotein may regulate drug transport processes in the entire CNS BBB at both the cellular and subcellular level.

A neural network based methodology for machining operations selection in Computer-Aided Process Planning for rotationally symmetrical parts	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT MANUFACTURING			English	Article						computer-aided process planning; machining process selection; alternative operation sequences; rotational parts; artificial neural networks	SYSTEM; CAPP	The relevant literature on machining operations selection in Computer-Aided Process Planning (CAPP) by decision trees, expert systems and neural networks has been reviewed, highlighting their contributions and shortcomings. This paper aims at contributing to the applicability of back-propagation neural network method for the selection of all possible operations for machining rotationally symmetrical components, by prestructuring the neural network with prior domain knowledge in the form of heuristic or thumb rules. It has been achieved by developing two forms of representation for the input data to the neural network. The external representation is used to enter the crisp values of the input decision variables (namely the feature type and its attributes such as diameter or width, tolerance and surface finish). The purpose of internal representation is to categorize the above crisp values into sets, which correspond to all the possible different ranges of the above input variables encountered in the antecedent 'IF' part of the thumb rules mentioned above. The input layer of the neural network has been designed in such a way that one neuronal node is allocated for each of the feature types and the sets of various feature attributes. In the output layer of the neural network, one neuronal node is allocated to each of the various feasible machining operation sequences found in the consequent 'THEN' part of the thumb rules. A systematic method for training of the neural network has been presented with the above thumb rules used to serve as guidelines for choosing the input patterns of the training examples. This method simplifies the process of training, reduces the time for preparation of training examples and hence the time to develop the overall process planning system. It can further help ensure that the entire problem domain is represented in a better manner and improve the quality of response of the neural network. The example of an industrially-relevant rotationally symmetrical workpiece has been analyzed using the proposed approach to demonstrate its potential for use in the real manufacturing environment. By this novel methodology, workpieces of complex shapes can be handled by investing a very limited amount of time, hence making it attractive and cost effective for industrial applications.

J Neurophysiol 96: 1991-2010, 2006. First published July 5, 2006, 2006;doi:10.1152/jn.00241.2006. During goal-directed locomotion, descending signals from supraspinal structures act through spinal interneuron pathways to effect modifications of muscle activity that are appropriate to the task requirements. Recent studies using decomposition methods suggest that this control might be facilitated by activating synergies organized at the level of the spinal cord. However, it is difficult to directly relate these mathematically defined synergies to the patterns of electromyographic activity observed in the original recordings. To address this issue, we have used a novel cluster analysis to make a detailed study of the organization of the synergistic patterns of muscle activity observed in the fore- and hindlimb during treadmill locomotion. The results show that the activity of a large number of forelimb muscles (26 bursts of activity from 18 muscles) can be grouped into 11 clusters on the basis of synchronous co-activation. Nine (9/11) of these clusters defined muscle activity during the swing phase of locomotion; these clusters were distributed in a sequential manner and were related to discrete behavioral events. A comparison with the synergies identified by linear decomposition methods showed some striking similarities between the synergies identified by the different methods. In the hindlimb, a simpler organization was observed, and a sequential activation of muscles similar to that observed in the forelimb during swing was less clear. We suggest that this organization of synergistic muscles provides a means by which descending signals could provide the detailed control of different muscle groups that is necessary for the flexible control of multi-articular movements.

In the present study, we compared the effects of rolipram and 4-[2-(3,4-bis-difluoromethoxyphenyl)-2-[4-(1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-hydroxypropan-2-yl)-phenyl]-ethyl]-3- methylpyridine-1-oxide (L-826,141), a novel nonbrain penetrant PDE4 inhibitor, on the onset and severity of clinical signs in a chronic, nonrelapsing/remitting model of EAE. Both rolipram (10mg/ kg p.o.) and L-826,141 (3 mg/kg p.o.) reduced the severity of EAE relative to controls, whereas L-826,141 (3 mg/kg p.o.) also delayed disease onset. To assess whether L-826,141 prevented EAE progression after the first signs of clinical onset, rolipram (10 mg/kg p.o.) or L-826,141 (3 or 30 mg/kg p.o.) were administered 24 h after the first signs of EAE were observed. Only L-826,141 at a dose of 30 mg/kg p.o. significantly decreased the clinical severity of EAE compared with vehicle controls. Immunohistochemical detection of the neuronal activity marker Fos confirmed that L-826,141 did not reach concentrations in the central nervous system sufficient to activate central neurons. Lipopolysaccharide-induced tumor necrosis factor-alpha in whole blood and plasma concentrations of L-826,141 revealed that only the 30-mg/kg dose resulted in levels sufficient to produce a near complete inhibition of PDE4 activity in immune cells. Taken together, these results demonstrate that peripheral PDE4 inhibition, produced by L-826,141, prevents the progression of EAE after the first onset of clinical signs, and suggest that similar compounds may have clinical efficacy in the treatment of MS.

The key idea is to model white matter fibres as 3D space curves and to then extend Parent and Zucker's 2D curve inference approach [Parent, P., Zucker, S., 1989. Trace inference, curvature consistency, and curve detection. IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence 11, 823-839] by using a notion of co-helicity to indicate compatibility between fibre orientations at each voxel with those in a local neighborhood. We argue that this provides several advantages over earlier regularization methods. We validate the approach quantitatively on a biological phantom and on synthetic data, and qualitatively on data acquired in vivo from a human brain. We also demonstrate the use of the technique to improve the performance of a fibre tracking algorithm. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Recent advances in rhythm biology have identified molecular clocks and their key regulating genes. Circadian clock genes (Clock, Per) were first isolated in Drosophila, and their homologous counterparts have been found in mammals. Some of the circadian master genes have been shown to influence sleeping behavior. For instance, a point mutation in a human clock gene (Per2) was shown to produce the rare advanced sleep phase syndrome, whereas a functional polymorphism in Per3 is associated with the more frequent delayed sleep phase syndrome. Furthermore, a study examining the association between Clock gene polymorphisms and insomnia revealed a higher recurrence of initial, middle, and terminal insomnia in patients homozygous for the Clock genotype. Other genes have been shown to contribute to sleep pathologies. A point mutation in the prion protein gene appears to be the cause of fatal familial insomnia. A missense mutation has been found in the gene encoding the GABA-A beta 3 subunit in a patient with chronic insomnia. In both animal models and humans, a deficiency in the hypocretin/orexin system was proposed to be responsible for narcolepsy. Selective destruction of hypocretin neurons is the most probable culprit in humans. These findings suggest that the genetic contribution to sleep disorders and wake determinants is more important than originally thought.

Herein, the presence of a heme oxygenase-1 suppressor (HOS) factor was ascertained by astroglial bioassay, biochemical techniques and immunofluorescence confocal microscopy. We report significantly augmented plasma HOS activity in AD patients relative to healthy elderly and neurological controls. The HOS factor was determined to be a 50-100 kDa beat-labile, heparin-binding glycoprotein that is unrelated to antioxidant ingestion, plasma total antioxidant capacity, circulating cortisol levels or apolipoprotein E epsilon 4 carrier status. HOS bioactivity was recapitulated by exogenous alpha(1)-antitrypsin. alpha(1)-antitrypsin levels were significantly increased in AD plasma and correlated with HOS activity and MMSE scores. alpha(1)-antitrypsin immunodepletion attenuated HOS activity of AD plasma. In AD brain, alpha(1)-antitrypsin immunoreactivity was augmented and co-distributed with HO-1. HOS activity of alpha(1)-antitrypsin may curtail HO-1-dependent derangement of cerebral iron homeostasis and account for diminished HO-1 expression in AD peripheral tissues. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Interactions between auditory and dorsal premotor cortex during synchronization to musical rhythms	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						finger tapping; motor timing; temporal; sensorimotor; premotor cortex; auditory cortex; fMRI	FINGER-TAPPING SEQUENCES; OLD-WORLD MONKEY; RHESUS-MONKEY; SENSORIMOTOR SYNCHRONIZATION; HEMIPARETIC STROKE; TEMPORAL PATTERNS; PLANUM TEMPORALE; FRONTAL-CORTEX; HUMAN BRAIN; FMRI	When listening to music, we often spontaneously synchronize our body movements to a rhythm's beat (e.g. tapping our feet). The goals of this study were to determine how features of a rhythm such as metric structure, can facilitate motor responses, and to elucidate the neural correlates of these auditory-motor interactions using fMRI. Five variants of an isochronous rhythm were created by increasing the contrast in sound amplitude between accented and unaccented tones, progressively highlighting the rhythm's metric structure. Subjects tapped in synchrony to these rhythms, and as metric saliency increased across the five levels, louder tones evoked longer tap durations with concomitant increases in the BOLD response at auditory and dorsal premotor cortices. The functional connectivity between these regions was also modulated by the stimulus manipulation. These results show that metric organization, as manipulated via intensity accentuation, modulates motor behavior and neural responses in auditory and dorsal premotor cortex. Auditory-motor interactions may take place at these regions with the dorsal premotor cortex interfacing sensory cues with temporally organized movement. (c) 2006 Published by Elsevier Inc.

We have synthesized a series of 3-(3,4'-dichlorophenyl)-1-indanamine monoamine reuptake inhibitors as candidates for such maintenance pharmacotherapy. The initial lead compound, the N,N-dimethyl analogue 30,640 was then subjected to testing in addiction-relevant animal models. Compound 30,640 (2 mg/kg i.p.) produced a pronounced slow-onset, long-lasting increase (300-400%) in extracellular nucleus accumbens dopamine levels, as measured by in vivo brain microdialysis in awake laboratory rats. Slow-onset, long-lasting decreases (40-80%) in the dopamine metabolites 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid and homovanillic acid, and the serotonin metabolite 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid were also seen. Compound 30,640 (3 or 5 mg/kg i.p.) also produced a significant (similar to 30%) slow-onset, long-lasting enhancement of electrical brain-stimulation reward, which was additive with that of cocaine (5 mg/kg i.p.). When given to cocaine-administering rats, 30,640 (2.5, 3, 5, or 10 mg/kg i.p.) significantly inhibited (30-60%) intravenous cocaine self-administration, with a pronounced long-lasting profile. In sum, 30,640 showed cocaine-like effects, but with a marked slow-onset, long-lasting profile. We conclude that the prodrug strategy employed in the design of 30,640 achieved its goal. We suggest that such compounds may be useful as maintenance pharmacotherapies for psychostimulant addiction. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Aged (24-25 months old) Long-Evans rats were behaviorally screened using the Morris water maze task and were classified as either aged, cognitively impaired (AI) or cognitively unimpaired (AU) based on their relative performances in the task compared to young control (Y) animals. Decreases in specific [I-125]NT binding were observed in the hippocampal formation, namely the dentate gyrus (DG), as well as in the septum and hypothalamus. Both aged groups also showed significant reductions in specific [I-125]NT binding levels compared to the Y animals in the hippocampal CA3 sub-field, with the AI animals exhibiting the lowest levels. In the Substantia Nigra Zona Compacta (SNc) and the ventral tegmental area (VTA), specific [I-125]NT binding was decreased as a function of age while binding in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVNh) was decreased as a function of age and cognitive status. These alterations in the level of specific [I-125]NT binding in the aged animals suggest decreases in NT receptor signaling as a function of age and potential involvement of NT-ergic systems in the etiology of age-related cognitive deficits.

Because of experimental limitations, structural characterization of the soluble oligomers, which form early in the process of fibrillogenesis and are cytotoxic, remains to be determined. In this article, we study the aggregation paths of seven chains of the shortest amyloid-forming peptide, using an activitated method and a reduced atomic representation. Our simulations show that disordered KFFE monomers ultimately form three distinct topologies of similar energy: amorphous oligomers, incomplete rings with beta-barrel character, and cross-beta-sheet structures with the meridional but not the equatorial X-ray fiber reflections. The simulations also shed light on the pathways from misfolded aggregates to fibrillar-like structures. They also underline the multiplicity of building blocks that can lead to the formation of the critical nucleus from which rapid growth of the fibril occurs.

The aim of this study was to review the pattern of diagnosis, the treatment, and outcome of secondary pediatric HGG. Patients and methods: We performed a multi-center retrospective study among the 17 paediatric institutions participating in the Canadian Pediatric Brain Tumour Consortium (CPBTC). Results: We report on 18 patients (14 mates, 4 females) treated in childhood for a primary cancer, who subsequently developed a HGG as a second malignancy. All patients had previously received radiation therapy +/- chemotherapy for either acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (n = 9) or solid tumour (n = 9). All HGG occurred within the previous radiation fields. At the last follow-up, 17 patients have died and the median survival time is 9.75 months. Conclusion: Although aggressive treatment seems to provide sustained remissions in some patients, the optimal management is still to be defined. Further documentation of such cases is necessary in order to better understand the pathogenesis, the natural history and the prevention of these tumours. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Coexisting secondary intraneural and vascular adventitial ganglion cysts of joint origin: a causal rather than a coincidental relationship supporting an articular theory	SKELETAL RADIOLOGY			English	Article						MRI; intraneural ganglion; vascular adventitial cyst; unified theory; synovial theory	TIBIOFIBULAR JOINT; NERVE; BRANCH; COMPRESSION; ARGUMENTS	Objective: To introduce the clinical entity of an intraneural ganglion cyst coexisting with a vascular adventitial cyst arising from the same joint. Design: Retrospective review. Patients: Two patients presented with predominantly deep peroneal neuropathy due to complex superior tibiofibular joint-related cysts. In addition to having peroneal intraneural ganglion cysts, these patients had vascular adventitial cysts: one involving a capsular arterial branch, the other a capsular vein [as well as a large, recurrent, intramuscular (extraneural) ganglion]. We then reviewed MRIs of 12 other consecutive cases of intraneural ganglia (10 peroneal and 2 tibial) arising from the superior tibiofibular joint that we treated, as well as other reported cases in the literature to determine if there were other (unrecognized) examples supporting the combination of clinical findings and radiographic patterns. Results: Retrospective analysis of MRIs in the two surgically proven cases of peroneal intraneural ganglia with vascular adventitial cyst extension showed a common imaging pattern that we have termed "the wishbone sign," consisting of the connection of the ascending limb of the peroneal intraneural ganglion and the longitudinal limb of the vascular adventitial cyst in the axial plane. Our review suggests that vascular adventitial cyst extension occurs in a large proportion of cases of peroneal intraneural ganglia. A similar growth pattern was noted in a case of a tibial intraneural ganglion. Conclusions: The combination of intraneural and vascular adventitial cysts is understandable given our knowledge of normal and pathologic anatomy of para-articular cysts. The combination of intraneural ganglia and vascular adventitial cysts broadens the spectrum of clinical presentations of these cysts and suggests that cysts and their content can dissect from a joint along neurovascular bundles. These cases provide important evidence to support the articular theory for the pathogenesis of not only neural but vascular adventitial cysts as well.

A new dynamic hysteresis model for magnetorheological dampers	SMART MATERIALS & STRUCTURES			English	Article							ELECTRORHEOLOGICAL DAMPERS; NEURAL-NETWORKS; SYSTEMS; IDENTIFICATION; SHEAR	Semi-actively controlled magnetorheological (MR) fluid dampers offer rapid variation in damping properties in a reliable fail-safe manner using very low power requirements. Their characteristics make them ideal for semi-active control in structures and vehicle applications in order to efficiently suppress vibration. To take advantage of their exceptional characteristics, a high fidelity model is required for control design and analysis. Perfect understanding of the dynamic characteristics of such dampers is necessary when implementing MR struts in applications. Different models have been proposed to simulate the hysteresis phenomenon of MR dampers. The Bouc - Wen model has been extensively used to simulate the hysteresis behavior of MR dampers. However, considerable differences still exist between the simulation and experimental results. Moreover, the characteristic parameters in the traditional Bouc - Wen model are not functions of the frequency, amplitude and current excitations; therefore, the estimated parameters can characterize the behavior of the tested MR damper under specific excitation conditions and must be re-evaluated if a different combination of excitation parameters is desired. This can be extremely cumbersome and computationally expensive. In this work, a new hysteresis model based on the Bouc - Wen model has been developed to better characterize the hysteresis phenomenon of the MR damper. The proposed model incorporates the frequency, amplitude and current excitation as variables and thus enables us to predict efficiently and accurately the hysteresis force for changing excitation conditions. The proposed modified Bouc - Wen model has been validated against the experimental results through graphical and quantitative analysis in time, displacement and velocity domains and an excellent correlation has been found.

Defecation is one of the simpler behaviors, involving a small number of muscles, a couple of neurons and only one neurotransmitter. This simplicity enables the precise characterization of the cells and genes required for executing the behavior and has made the defecation behavior a powerful model for investigating the genetic basis of nervous system function, muscle differentiation, rhythmic behaviors and oscillatory calcium signaling, and the metabolic and environmental regulation of behavior. Our review highlights how the function of a system even this simple results from the integration of many aspects of an organism's biology and involves the action of diverse genes.

Deficiency in parvalbumin, but not in calbindin D-28K upregulates mitochondrial volume and decreases smooth endoplasmic reticulum surface selectively in a peripheral, subplasmalemmal region in the soma of Purkinje cells	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						calcium-binding; buffers; EF-hand; homeostasis; morphology	MEMBRANE CA2+ PUMP; RAT CEREBELLAR SLICES; FAST-TWITCH MUSCLES; GEL-ELECTROPHORESIS; SKELETAL-MUSCLE; CALCIUM STORES; NEURONS; PROTEINS; BINDING; MICE	The Ca(2+)-binding proteins parvalbumin (PV) and calbindin D-28k (CB) are key players in the intracellular Ca(2+)-buffering in specific cells including neurons and have profound effects on spatiotemporal aspects of Ca(2+) transients. The previously observed increase in mitochondrial volume density in fast-twitch muscle of PV-/- mice is viewed as a specific compensation mechanism to maintain Ca(2+) homeostasis. Since cerebellar Purkinje cells (PC) are characterized by high expression levels of the Ca(2+) buffers PV and CB, the question was raised, whether homeostatic mechanisms are induced in PC lacking these buffers. Mitochondrial volume density, i.e. relative mitochondrial mass was increased by 40% in the soma of PV-/- PC. Upregulation of mitochondrial volume density was not homogenous throughout the soma, but was selectively restricted to a peripheral region of 1.5 mu m width underneath the plasma membrane. Accompanied was a decreased surface of subplasmalemmal smooth endoplasmic reticulum (sPL-sER) in a shell of 0.5 mu m thickness underneath the plasma membrane. These alterations were specific for the absence of the "slow-onset" buffer PV, since in CB-/- mice neither changes in peripheral mitochondria nor in sPL-sER were observed. This implicates that the morphological alterations are aimed to specifically substitute the function of the slow buffer PV. We propose a novel concept that homeostatic mechanisms of components involved in Ca(2+) homeostasis do not always occur at the level of similar or closely related molecules. Rather the cell attempts to restore spatiotemporal aspects of Ca(2+) signals prevailing in the undisturbed (wildtype) situation by subtly fine tuning existing components involved in the regulation of Ca(2+) fluxes.

After reviewing some pitfalls that must be avoided when claiming functional recovery and the importance of a conceptual framework for the control of locomotion, locomotor recovery after spinal lesions, mainly in cats, is summarized. It is concluded that recovery is partly due to plastic changes within the existing spinal locomotor networks. Locomotor training appears to change the excitability of simple reflex pathways as well as more complex circuitry. The spinal cord possesses an intrinsic capacity to adapt to lesions of central tracts or peripheral nerves but, as a rule, adaptation to lesions entails changes at both spinal and supraspinal levels. A brief summary of the spinal capacity of the rat, mouse and human to express spinal locomotor patterns is given, indicating that the concepts derived mainly from work in the cat extend to other adult mammals. It is hoped that some of the issues presented will help to evaluate how plasticity of existing connections may combine with and potentiate treatments designed to promote regeneration to optimize remaining motor functions.

The molecular basis for this GABAergic response appears to be the Na(+)K(+)2Cl(-) cotransporter NKCC1 that contributes to the maintenance of a high intracellular chloride concentration. Recently, a role for NKCC1 has been proposed in nociceptive processing which makes it timely to gain a better understanding of the distribution of NKCC1 in sensory ganglia. Here, we describe that, in the rat, NKCC1 mRNA is predominately expressed by small and medium diameter dorsal root (DRG) and trigeminal (TG) ganglion neurons. The colocalization of NKCC1 mRNA with sensory neuron population markers was assessed. In the DRG, many NKCC1 mRNA-expressing neurons colocalized peripherin (57.0 +/- 2.5%), calcitonin-gene-related peptide (CGRP, 39.2 +/- 4.4%) or TRPV1 immunoreactivity (50.0 +/- 1.9%) whereas only 8.7 +/- 1.2% were co-labeled with a marker for large diameter afferents (N52). Similarly, in the TG, NKCC1 mRNA-expressing neurons frequently colocalized peripherin (50.0 +/- 3.0%), CGRP (35.4 +/- 2.6%) or TRPV1 immunoreactivity (44.7 +/- 1.2%) while 14.8 +/- 1.3% were co-labeled with the N52 antibody. NKCC1 mRNA was also detected in satellite glial (SGCs) in both the DRG and TG. Colocalization of NKCC1 protein with the SGC marker NG2 confirmed the phenotype of these NKCC1-expressing glial cells. In contrast to in situ hybridization experiments, we did not observe NKCC1 immunoreactivity in primary afferent somata. These findings suggest that NKCC1 is expressed in anatomically appropriate cells in order to modulate GABAergic responses in nociceptive neurons. Moreover, these results suggest the possibility of a functional role of NKCC1 in the glial cells closely apposed to primary sensory afferents. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The earlier peak expression of alpha-internexin than the triplet during brain development and its ability to form homopolymers, unlike the triplet, which are obligate heteropolymers, have supported a widely held view that alpha-internexin and neurofilament triplet form separate filament systems. Here, we demonstrate, however, that despite a postnatal decline in expression, alpha-internexin is as abundant as the triplet in the adult CNS and exists in a relatively fixed stoichiometry with these subunits. alpha-Internexin exhibits transport and turnover rates identical to those of triplet proteins in optic axons and colocalizes with NF-M on single neurofilaments by immunogold electron microscopy. alpha-Internexin also coassembles with all three neurofilament proteins into a single network of filaments in quadruple-transfected SW13vim(-) cells. Genetically deleting NF-M alone or together with NF-H in mice dramatically reduces alpha-internexin transport and content in axons throughout the CNS. Moreover, deleting alpha-internexin potentiates the effects of NF-M deletion on NF-Hand NF-L transport. Finally, overexpressing a NF-H-LacZ fusion protein in mice induces alpha-internexin and neurofilament triplet to aggregate in neuronal perikarya and greatly reduces their transport and content selectively in axons. Our data show that alpha-internexin and the neurofilament proteins are functionally interdependent. The results strongly support the view that alpha-internexin is a fourth subunit of neurofilaments in the adult CNS, providing a basis for its close relationship with neurofilaments in CNS diseases associated with neurofilament accumulation.

The brain activity of Carmelite nuns was measured while they were subjectively in a state of union with God. This state was associated with significant loci of activation in the right medial orbitofirontal cortex, right middle temporal cortex, right inferior and superior parietal lobules, right caudate, left medial prefrontal cortex, left anterior cingulate cortex, left inferior parietal lobule, left insula, left caudate, and left brainstem. Other loci of activation were seen in the extra-striate visual cortex. These results suggest that mystical experiences are mediated by several brain regions and systems.

To assess the contribution of maternal influences in determining adult brain monoamine responses to a stressor, strains of mice that were either stressor-reactive or -resilient (BALB/cByJ and C57BL/6ByJ, respectively) were assessed as a function of whether they were raising their biological offspring or those of the other strain. As adults, offspring were assessed with respect to stressor-provoked plasma corticosterone elevations and monoamine variations within discrete stressor-sensitive brain regions. BALB/cByJ mice demonstrated poorer maternal behaviors than C57BL/6ByJ dams, irrespective of the pups being raised. In response to a noise stressor, BALB/cByJ mice exhibited higher plasma corticosterone levels and elevated monoamine turnover in several limbic and hypothalamic sites. The stressor-provoked corticosterone increase in BALB/cByJ mice was diminished among males (but not females) raised by a C57BL/6ByJ dam. Moreover, increased prefrontal cortical dopamine utilization was attenuated among BALB/cByJ mice raised by a C57BL/6ByJ dam. These effects were asymmetrical as a C57BL/6ByJ mice raised by a BALB/cByJ dam did not exhibit increased stressor reactivity. It appears that stressors influence multiple neurochemical systems that have been implicated in anxiety and affective disorders. Although monoamine variations were largely determined by genetic factors, maternal influences contributed to stressor-elicited neurochemical changes in some regions, particularly dopamine activation within the prefrontal cortex.

Traditionally, these two problems have been viewed as separate, and theories of decision making and motor planning have been developed primarily independently. However, neural data suggests that these processes involve the same brain regions and are performed in an integrated manner. Here, a computational model is described that addresses both the question of how different potential actions are specified and how the brain decides between them. In the model, multiple potential actions are simultaneously represented as continuous regions of activity within populations of cells in frontoparietal cortex. These representations engage in a competition for overt execution that is biased by modulatory influences from prefrontal cortex. The model neural populations exhibit activity patterns that correlate with both the spatial metrics of potential actions and their associated decision variables, in a manner similar to activities in parietal, prefrontal, and premotor cortex. The model therefore suggests an explanation for neural data that have been hard to account for in terms of serial theories that propose that decision making occurs before action planning. In addition to simulating the activity of individual neurons during decision tasks, the model also reproduces key aspects of the spatial and temporal statistics of human choices and makes a number of testable predictions.

A number of transporters, binding proteins, reductases, and ferroxidases help maintain iron homeostasis to prevent cell damage. The multi-copper ferroxidase ceruloplasmin (Cp) converts toxic ferrous iron to its nontoxic ferric form and is required for iron efflux from cells. Absence of this enzyme in humans leads to iron accumulation and neurodegeneration in the CNS. Here we report on the changes that occur in the cerebellum of Cp null (Cp-/-) mice with aging. We show that iron accumulation, which is reflected in increased ferritin expression, occurs mainly in astrocytes by 24 months in Cp-/- mice and is accompanied by a significant loss of these cells. In contrast, Purkinje neurons and the large neurons in the deep nuclei of Cp-/- mice do not accumulate iron but express high levels of the iron importer divalent metal transporter 1, suggesting that these cells may be iron deprived. This is also accompanied by a significant reduction in the number of Purkinje neurons. These data suggest that astrocytes play a central role in the acquisition of iron from the circulation and that two different mechanisms underlie the loss of astrocytes and neurons in Cp-/- mice. These findings provide a better understanding of the degenerative changes seen in humans with aceruloplasminemia and have implications for normal aging and neurodegenerative diseases in which iron accumulation occurs.

Results: We report here that Nur77-deficient mice display enhanced spontaneous locomotor activity, greater sensitivity to a small dose of the dopamine D-2 receptor agonist quinpirole acting mainly at autoreceptor sites, and higher levels of the dopamine metabolite DOPAC relative to wild-type mice. Dopamine turnover disturbances are also found after acute challenge with haloperidol, a dopamine D2 receptor antagonist. These alterations are associated with increased tyrosine hydroxylase expression and activity, and reduced catechol-O-methyltransferase expression. Conclusion: Taken together, these results are consistent with the involvement of Nur77 in dopamine neuron biochemical activity and dopamine turnover.

Analysis and design of split and merge unpaced assembly systems by metamodelling and stochastic search	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH			English	Article						split-and-merge unpaced assembly systems; genetic algorithms; metamodelling; artificial neural networks	OPTIMAL BUFFER ALLOCATION; MANUFACTURING SYSTEMS; PRODUCTION LINES; UNRELIABLE MACHINES; GENETIC ALGORITHMS; NEURAL-NETWORK	The study presents a new approach in optimal interstage buffer allocation problem of split-and-merge unpaced open assembly systems, which are increasingly being used in modern manufacturing systems, particularly in automotive industries. Allocations of interstage buffers to accommodate the work-in-process inventories are optimized in an attempt to maximize the overall system production rate. A simulation model developed is used in conjunction with genetic algorithms (GA) to find optimal interstage buffer configurations yielding a maximum production rate. However, simulation is extremely time-consuming due to lengthy computational requirements, especially when used in a stochastic search algorithm. In an attempt to overcome this problem, an alternative approach in simulation metamodelling based on artificial neural networks ( ANN) is developed. The optimization problem previously conducted through simulation and GA is reconsidered by integrating the metamodelling approach into the GA, replacing the simulation model. The new ANN-GA approach not only gives solutions with no statistically significant difference in comparison with the original simulation GA approach, but also demands significantly less computational time. The proposed methodology intends to help practising system design engineers to take quicker decisions regarding the assembly system design parameters. The potential of metamodelling to solve manufacturing systems problems are also discussed.

Here we report profound effects of the Kv4.2 C terminus on the surface expression and activation gating properties of Kv4.2 that are modulated by the direct interaction between KChIP2, an auxiliary regulatory subunit, and the C terminus of Kv4.2. We show that increasingly large truncations of the C terminus of rat Kv4.2 (wild type) cause a progressive decrease of Kv4.2 current along with a shift in voltage-dependent activation that is closely correlated with negative charge deletion. Co-expression of more limited Kv4.2 C-terminal truncation mutants (T588 and T528) with KChIP2 results in a doubling of Kv4.2 protein expression and up to an 8-fold increase in Kv4.2 current amplitude. Pulse-chase experiments show that co-expression with KChIP2 slows Kv4.2 wild type degradation 8-fold. Co-expression of KChIP2 with an intermediate-length C-terminal truncation mutant (T474) shifts Kv4.2 activation voltage dependence and enhances expression of Kv4.2 current. The largest truncation mutants (T417 and Delta C) show an intracellular localization with no measurable currents and no response to KChIP2 co-expression. Co-immunoprecipitation and competitive glutathione S-transferase-binding assays indicate a direct interaction between KChIP2 and the Kv4.2 C terminus with a relative binding affinity comparable with that of the N terminus. Overall, these results suggest that the C-terminal domain of Kv4.2 plays a critical role in voltage-dependent activation and functional expression that is mediated by direct interaction between the Kv4.2 C terminus and KChIP2.

Monocyte differentiation up-regulates the expression of the lysosomal sialidase, Neu1, and triggers its targeting to the plasma membrane via major histocompatibility complex class II-positive compartments	JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							CULTURED HUMAN-FIBROBLASTS; TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR AP-1; LEUKEMIA-CELL LINE; GENE-EXPRESSION; T-CELLS; PROTECTIVE PROTEIN; DENDRITIC CELLS; C-FOS; NEURAMINIDASE; JUN	Human sialidase (neuraminidase) Neu1 catalyzes lysosomal catabolism of sialylated glycoconjugates. Here we show that during the differentiation of monocytes and the monocytic cell line, THP-1, into macrophages, the majority of Neu1 relocalizes from the lysosomes to the cell surface. In contrast to other cellular sialidases Neu2, Neu3, and Neu4, whose expression either remains unchanged or is down-regulated, Neu1 mRNA, protein and activity are specifically increased during the phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-induced differentiation, consistent with a significant induction of the transcriptional activity of the Neu1 gene promoter. The lysosomal carboxypeptidase, cathepsin A, which forms a complex with and activates Neu1 in the lysosome, is sorted to the plasma membrane of the differentiating cells similarly to Neu1. Both proteins are first targeted to the lysosome and then are sorted to the LAMP-2-negative, major histocompatibility complex II-positive vesicles, which later merge with the plasma membrane. Similar trafficking was observed for the internalized fluorescent dextran or horseradish peroxidase initially stored in the lysosomal/endosomal compartment. The suppression of Neu1 expression in the THP-1-derived macrophages by small interfering RNA or with anti-Neu1 antibodies significantly reduced the ability of the cells to engulf bacteria or to produce cytokines. Altogether our data suggest that the upregulation of the Neu1 expression is important for the primary function of macrophages and establish the link between Neu1 and the cellular immune response.

Related to this, a composite sequence motif has recently been identified that couples phosphorylation, sumoylation, and perhaps also deacetylation to control transcriptional repression in stress response, mitogen and nuclear hormone signaling, myogenesis, and neuronal differentiation. This motif is present in many proteins, integrates cellular signals from diverse pathways, and serves as a valuable signature for in silico identification of proteins regulated by adjacent phosphorylation and sumoylation.

Formation of Neu/ErbB2-induced mammary tumors is unaffected by loss of ErbB4	ONCOGENE			English	Article						ErbB; HER-4; breast cancer; MMTV-Neu; carcinoma	GROWTH-FACTOR RECEPTOR; BREAST-CANCER CELLS; CONSTITUTIVELY ACTIVE ERBB4; TRANSGENIC MICE; NEU PROTOONCOGENE; TYROSINE KINASES; PROGNOSTIC-SIGNIFICANCE; ACTIVATING MUTATIONS; NEUREGULIN RECEPTOR; MESSENGER-RNA	The four members of the ErbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases are involved in development and tumorigenesis of the mammary gland. Whereas the epidermal growth factor receptor, ErbB2 and ErbB3 are positively associated with various cancers, clinical studies of ErbB4 in breast cancer are contradictory. Results from tissue culture analyses and some clinical studies suggested that ErbB4 is either a tumor suppressor or is a negative regulator of ErbB2-driven tumors. Neu-Cre-ErbB4(flox/null) mice in which ErbB4 was inactivated by Cre-lox-mediated recombination in the mammary gland developed MMTV-Neu-driven mammary tumors with a similar latency period to mice with one or two wild-type ErbB4 alleles. Moreover, there was no difference in the histologies of tumors that developed, nor in the propensity to form lung metastases. Taken together these results suggest that ErbB4 is not a potent, highly penetrant tumor suppressor, nor is it a factor in Neu-mediated tumorigenesis in this model.

Expression of multiple P2X receptors by glossopharyngeal neurons projecting to rat carotid body O-2-chemoreceptors: Role in nitric oxide-mediated efferent inhibition	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						ATP; CB chemoreceptors; efferent inhibition; glossopharyngeal neurons; hypoxia; NO; P2X receptor	PETROSAL NEURONS; MOLECULAR PHYSIOLOGY; SENSORY NEURONS; TYPE-1 CELLS; ATP; HYPOXIA; COCULTURES; CHANNELS; SYNTHASE; SUBUNITS	In mammals, ventilation is peripherally controlled by the carotid body ( CB), which receives afferent innervation from the petrosal ganglion and efferent innervation from neurons located along the glossopharyngeal nerve (GPN). GPN neurons give rise to the "efferent inhibitory" pathway via a plexus of neuronal nitric oxide (NO) synthase-positive fibers, believed to be responsible for CB chemoreceptor inhibition via NO release. Although NO is elevated during natural CB stimulation by hypoxia, the underlying mechanisms are unclear. We hypothesized that ATP, released by rat CB chemoreceptors (type 1 cells) and/or red blood cells during hypoxia, may directly activate GPN neurons and contribute to NO-mediated inhibition. Using combined electrophysiological, molecular, and confocal immunofluorescence techniques, we detected the expression of multiple P2X receptors in GPN neurons. These receptors involve at least four different purinergic subunits: P2X(2) [and the splice variant P2X(2(b))], P2X(3), P2X(4), and P2X(7). Using a novel coculture preparation of CB type I cell clusters and GPN neurons, we tested the role of P2X signaling on CB function. In cocultures, fast application of ATP, or its synthetic analog 2', 3'-O-(4 benzoylbenzoyl)-ATP, caused type I cell hyperpolarization that was prevented in the presence of the NO scavenger 2-(4-carboxyphenyl)-4,4,5,5- tetramethyl-imidazoline-1-oxyl-3-oxide potassium. These data suggest that ATP released during hypoxic stress from CB chemoreceptors (and/or red blood cells) will cause GPN neuron depolarization mediated by multiple P2X receptors. Activation of this pathway will lead to calcium influx and efferent inhibition of CB chemoreceptors via NO synthesis and consequent release.

The purpose of our study was to explore factors that may affect the likelihood of driving cessation in a sample of elderly, community-dwelling patients with dementia. Methods: A 3-year prospective study, the Canadian Outcomes Study in Dementia (COSID) has enrolled 883 patients with mild-to-moderate dementia at 32 centres across Canada. Assessment tools included the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) for cognition, the Global Deterioration Scale (GDS) for staging ( severity), the Functional Autonomy Measurement System (SMAF) for function, and the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) for behaviour. Factors associated with the decision to quit driving after the baseline assessment were tested with Cox survival analysis. Results: Of 719 subjects who were or had been drivers, 203 (28.2%) were still driving at baseline. Over an observation period that averaged 23 months, 97 (48.5%) of 200 patients quit driving. Factors predictive of driving cessation included GDS ( hazard ratio [HR] 1.68, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.15-2.45), MMSE score ( HR 0.90, 95% CI 0.83 - 0.97) and NPI findings ( HR 1.63 for presence of = 3 behaviours, 95% CI 1.01-2.62). Among the NPI behaviours, when they were analyzed separately, agitation led to a decreased likelihood of driving cessation (p=0.019), whereas apathy (p=0.031) and hallucinations (p=0.050) led to an increased likelihood. Interpretation: Cognitive impairment and behaviours such as agitation, apathy and hallucinations were significant predictors of driving cessation in patients with a mild to moderate degree of dementia. These findings should be considered when one counsels patients and their families.

In this case, the patients need treatment to control their symptoms. Pharmacologic agents have been reported to have positive and negative impacts on REM sleep muscle atonia and the motor behaviors associated with RBD. Clonazepam is efficacious and well tolerated by the majority of patients afflicted by RBD and should be considered as initial treatment. In patients at risk of falls who have cognitive impairment or who have obstructive sleep apneas, melatonin may be a good alternative to clonazepam. Anticholinesterase inhibitors and dopaminergic agents are not of clear benefit. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, serotonergic synaptic reuptake inhibitors, and noradrenergic antagonists can induce or aggravate RBD symptoms and should be avoided in patients with RBD. When these agents are prescribed to patients with neurodegenerative disorders or narcolepsy who are at risk of developing RBD, systematic follow-up may be warranted to detect the emergence of RBD symptoms.

In this study, we identified components of the Hoxd4 P1 promoter directing expression in neurally differentiating retinoic acid-treated P19 cells. We mapped three nucleosomes that are subsequently remodeled into an open chromatin state upon retinoic acid-induced Hoxd4 transcription. These nucleosomes spanned the Hoxd4 transcriptional start site in addition to a GC-rich positive regulatory element located 3' to the initiation site. We further identified two major cis-acting regulatory elements. An autoregulatory element was shown to recruit HOXD4 and its cofactor PBX1 and to positively regulate Hoxd4 expression in differentiating P19 cells. Conversely, the Polycomb group (PcG) protein Ying-Yang 1 (YY1) binds to an internucleosomal linker and represses Hoxd4 transcription before and during transcriptional activation. Sequential chromatin immunoprecipitation studies revealed that the PcG protein MEL18 was co-recruited with YY1 only in undifferentiated P19 cells, suggesting a role for MEL18 in silencing Hoxd4 transcription in undifferentiated P19 cells. This study links for the first time local chromatin remodeling events that take place during transcriptional activation with the dynamics of transcription factor association and DNA accessibility at a Hox regulatory region.

Dissociating the dual roles of apoptosis-inducing factor in maintaining mitochondrial structure and apoptosis	EMBO JOURNAL			English	Article						apoptosis; apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF); DNA damage; mitochondria; neuron	NEURONAL CELL-DEATH; D-LACTATE DEHYDROGENASE; CYTOCHROME-C; NUCLEAR TRANSLOCATION; CEREBRAL-ISCHEMIA; DNA-DEGRADATION; INNER MEMBRANE; NITRIC-OXIDE; AIF; ACTIVATION	The mitochondrial protein apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) translocates to the nucleus and induces apoptosis. Recent studies, however, have indicated the importance of AIF for survival in mitochondria. In the absence of a means to dissociate these two functions, the precise roles of AIF remain unclear. Here, we dissociate these dual roles using mitochondrially anchored AIF that cannot be released during apoptosis. Forebrain-specific AIF null (tel. Aif(Delta)) mice have defective cortical development and reduced neuronal survival due to defects in mitochondrial respiration. Mitochondria in AIF deficient neurons are fragmented with aberrant cristae, indicating a novel role of AIF in controlling mitochondrial structure. While tel. Aif Delta Apaf1-/- neurons remain sensitive to DNA damage, mitochondrially anchored AIF expression in these cells significantly enhanced survival. AIF mutants that cannot translocate into nucleus failed to induce cell death. These results indicate that the proapoptotic role of AIF can be uncoupled from its physiological function. Cell death induced by AIF is through its proapoptotic activity once it is translocated to the nucleus, not due to the loss of AIF from the mitochondria.

Nonlinear interaction between shunting and adaptation controls a switch between integration and coincidence detection in pyramidal neuron	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						AHP current; coincidence detector; integrator; M current; membrane conductance; spike-time precision	NEOCORTICAL NEURONS; IN-VIVO; CORTICAL-NEURONS; HIPPOCAMPAL-NEURONS; POTASSIUM CURRENTS; SYMPATHETIC NEURONS; SYNAPTIC ACTIVITY; DYNAMIC CLAMP; CELLS; CA2+	The membrane conductance of a pyramidal neuron in vivo is substantially increased by background synaptic input. Increased membrane conductance, or shunting, does not simply reduce neuronal excitability. Recordings from hippocampal pyramidal neurons using dynamic clamp revealed that adaptation caused complete cessation of spiking in the high conductance state, whereas repetitive spiking could persist despite adaptation in the low conductance state. This behavior was reproduced in a phase plane model and was explained by a shunting-induced increase in voltage threshold. The increase in threshold allows greater activation of the M current (I-M) at subthreshold potentials and reduces the minimum adaptation required to stabilize the system; in contrast, activation of the after hyperpolarization current is unaffected by the increase in threshold and therefore remains unable to stop repetitive spiking. The nonlinear interaction between shunting and IM has other important consequences. First, timing of spikes elicited by brief stimuli is more precise when background spikes elicited by sustained input are prohibited, as occurs exclusively with I-M-mediated adaptation in the high conductance state. Second, activation of IM at subthreshold potentials, which is increased in the high conductance state, hyperpolarizes average membrane potential away from voltage threshold, allowing only large, rapid fluctuations to reach threshold and elicit spikes. These results suggest that the shift from a low to high conductance state in a pyramidal neuron is accompanied by a switch from encoding time-averaged input with firing rate to encoding transient inputs with precisely timed spikes, in effect, switching the operational mode from integration to coincidence detection.

Here, we present the high-resolution NMR structure of stem-loop V (SL5) in the presence of Mg2+ (SL5(Mg)) and demonstrate that Mg2+ induces a conformational change in which the SL5 loop adopts a compact structure with most characteristics of canonical U-turn structures. Divalent cation-binding sites were probed with Mn2+-induced paramagnetic line broadening and intermolecular NOEs to Co(NH3)(6)(3+). Structural modeling of Mn(H2O)(6)(2+) in SL5(Mg) revealed four divalent cation-binding sites in the loop. Sites 1, 3, and 4 are located in the major groove near multiple phosphate groups, whereas site 2 is adjacent to N7 of G697 and N7 of A698 in the minor groove. Cation-binding sites equivalent to sites 1-3 in SL5 are present in other U-turn motifs, and these metal-binding sites may represent a common feature of the U-turn fold. Although magnesium ions affect the loop conformation, they do not significantly change the conformation of residues 697-699 involved in the proposed Watson-Crick base pairs with stem-loop I. In both the presence and the absence of Mg2+, G697, A698, and C699 adopt an A-form structure that exposes their Watson-Crick faces, and this is compatible with their proposed interaction with stem-loop I. In SL5(Mg), however, U700 becomes exposed on the minor groove face of the loop in the proximity of the bases of G697, A698, and C699, suggesting that the Mg2+-bound conformation of stem-loop V allows additional contacts with stem-loop I. These studies improve our understanding of the role of Mg2+ in U-turn structures and in substrate recognition by the VS ribozyme.

Subdural hematomas in infants with benign enlargement of the subarachnoid spaces are not pathognomonic for child abuse	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY			English	Article							NONACCIDENTAL HEAD-INJURY; PERMANENT BRAIN-DAMAGE; EXTERNAL HYDROCEPHALUS; MENTAL-RETARDATION; FLUID COLLECTION; YOUNG-CHILDREN; SHAKING; TRAUMA; US	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Patients who have benign enlargement of the subarachnoid spaces (BESS) have long been suspected of having an increased propensity for subdural hematomas either spontaneously or as a result of accidental injury. Subdural hematomas in infants are often equated with nonaccidental trauma (NAT). A better understanding of the clinical and imaging characteristics of subdural hematomas that occur either spontaneously or as a result of accidental trauma may help distinguish this group of patients from those who suffer subdural hematomas as a result of NAT. The purpose of this study is to describe the clinical and imaging characteristics of subdural hematomas that occur either spontaneously or as a result of accidental injury in infants with BESS. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of all patients with BESS complicated by subdural hematomas evaluated at a single institution from 1998 to 2004. Data concerning the patient's clinical presentation, physical findings, imaging, and management are described. RESULTS: During the study period, 7 patients with BESS complicated by subdural hematoma were identified. Their mean age at identification of the subdural hematoma was 7.4 months of age. In 5 cases, there was no recognized trauma before identification of the subdural hematoma. In 3 cases, baseline CT or MR imaging was available, showing prominent subarachnoid spaces without any evidence of subdural hemorrhage. CONCLUSION: Although suspicious for NAT, subdural hematomas can occur in children either spontaneously or as a result of accidental trauma. Caution must be exercised when investigating for NAT based on the sole presence of subdural hematomas, especially in children who are otherwise well and who have BESS.

Phase I study of Aplidine in a dailyx5 one-hour infusion every 3 weeks in patients with solid tumors refractory to standard therapy. A National Cancer Institute of Canada Clinical Trials Group study: NCICCTG IND 115	ANNALS OF ONCOLOGY			English	Article						aplidine; phase I clinical trial	DIDEMNIN-B; DEHYDRODIDEMNIN-B; MARINE	Background: Aplidine is a cyclic depsipeptide isolated from the marine tunicate Aplidium albicans. Methods: This phase I study of Aplidine given as a 1-hour i.v. infusion daily for 5 days every 3 weeks was conducted in patients with refractory solid tumors. Objectives were to define the dose limiting toxicities, the maximal tolerated dose, and the recommended phase II dose. Results: Thirty-seven patients were accrued on study. Doses ranged from 80 mu g/m(2) to 1500 mu g/m(2)/day. Eleven patients received more than three cycles of Aplidine. Dose-limiting toxicities occurred at 1500 mu g/m(2) and 1350 mu g/m(2)/day and consisted of nausea, vomiting, myalgia, fatigue, skin rash and diarrhea. Mild to moderate muscular pain and weakness was noted in patients treated with multiple cycles with no significant drug related neurotoxicity. Bone marrow toxicity was not observed. The recommended dose for phase II studies was 1200 mu g/m(2) daily for 5 days, every 3 weeks. Pharmacokinetic studies performed during the first cycle demonstrated that therapeutic plasma levels of Aplidine are reachable well below the recommended dose. Nine patients with progressive disease at study entry had stable disease and two had minor responses, one in non-small cell lung cancer and one in colorectal cancer. Conclusions: Aplidine given at a dose of 1200 mu g/m(2) daily for 5 days, every 3 weeks is well tolerated with few severe adverse events. This schedule of Aplidine is under evaluation in phase II studies in hematological malignancies and solid tumors.

Clinical hallmarks of IGE syndromes include generalized spike and wave discharges and normal results on brain imaging. Objective: To describe 2 patients with clinical presentations compatible with IGE but whose imaging studies revealed unilateral thalamic lesions. Design: Case reports. Setting: University-affiliated hospitals. Patients: Two 21-year-old patients (1 man and 1 woman). Main Outcome Measures: Magnetic resonance imaging findings. Results: Magnetic resonance imaging unexpectedly revealed unilateral thalamic lesions. Conclusions: We recommend doing magnetic resonance imaging studies in patients with IGE, especially in refractory or atypical cases. In rare cases, clinical features compatible with IGE may be associated with structural thalamic or other lesions.

A new autosomal recessive spastic ataxia associated with frequent white matter changes maps to 2q33-34	BRAIN			English	Article						spastic ataxia; paraplegia; founder effect; linkage; genome-wide-scan	CHARLEVOIX-SAGUENAY; FRIEDREICH ATAXIA; GENE; MUTATIONS; PARAPLEGIA; PARALYSIS; FAMILIES; FEATURES; QUEBEC; ONSET	Recessive ataxias are a heterogeneous group of diseases. We identified a group of 23 French-Canadian cases belonging to 17 families affected by an autosomal recessive spastic ataxia associated with frequent white matter changes. The fact that 59% of these families have a genealogical relationship to the Portneuf County of Quebec suggests that this is a new form of ataxia with a regional founder effect. All cases present with cerebellar ataxia and spasticity. There is great intrafamilial and interfamilial variability, as illustrated by the spectrum of age of diagnosis (range: 2-59 years, mean: 15.0) and the presence of white matter changes on MRI in 52.4% of cases. The more severe cases have spasticity from birth, scoliosis, dystonia and cognitive impairment and were considered cases of cerebral palsy. Brain MRI constantly shows cerebellar atrophy, which in some cases may be associated with cortical atrophy, leucoencephalopathy and corpus callosum thinning. A genome wide scan uncovered linkage of three families to marker D2S2321 localized on chromosome 2q33-34. Linkage analysis confirmed that all families are linked to the same region [multipoint log of the odds (LOD) score of 5.95]. Haplotype analysis and allele sharing suggest that one common mutation may account for 97% of carrier chromosomes in Quebec. The uncovering of the mutated gene may point to a common pathway for pyramidal and cerebellar degeneration as both are often observed in recessive ataxias and complicated paraplegias.

The results showed the word length and the letter confusability effects characteristic of LBL dyslexia. However, the interaction of letter confusability and N size (i.e. a facilitatory effect only for low confusability targets) previously observed in LBL dyslexics [Arguin, M., Fiset, S., & Bub, D.

Our results suggest that the type of visual degradation employed here may only partially correspond to the visual deficit present in LBL dyslexia and that this degradation may have prevented the normal readers from accessing visual information available to LBL dyslexics when they use the compensatory strategy of serial letter processing.

This paper reviews published data on the economic impact of CBT to inform recommendations for current Canadian mental health care funding policy. Method: We searched the literature for economic analyses of CBT in the treatment of mental disorders. Results: We identified 22 health economic studies involving CBT for mood, anxiety, psychotic, and somatoform disorders. Across health care settings and patient populations, CBT alone or in combination with pharmacotherapy represented acceptable value for health dollars spent, with CBT costs offset by reduced health care use. Conclusions: International evidence suggests CBT is cost-effective. Greater access to CBT would likely improve outcomes and result in cost savings. Future research is warranted to evaluate the economic impact of CBT in Canada.

J	Balaban, E				Balaban, Evan			Cognitive developmental biology: History, process and fortune's wheel	COGNITION			English	Article						behavioral development; behavioral evolution; cognitive development; developmental processes	OCULAR DOMINANCE COLUMNS; PAIR-BOND FORMATION; AUDITORY SPACE MAP; FINCH SONG SYSTEM; ADULT BARN OWLS; LANGUAGE IMPAIRMENT; VISUAL-CORTEX; BRAIN-DEVELOPMENT; FOXP2 EXPRESSION; PRAIRIE VOLES	Biological contributions to cognitive development continue to be conceived predominantly along deterministic lines, with proponents of different positions arguing about the preponderance of gene-based versus experience-based influences that organize brain circuits irreversibly during prenatal or early postnatal life, and evolutionary influences acting through selection on small numbers of genes. This article discusses evolutionary, mechanistic and probabilistic aspects of developmental processes that cognitive scientists need to better integrate. Developmental processes inseparably fuse experience-dependent and experience-independent components, have important stochastic contributions, and exhibit a greater degree of mechanistic continuity between developing and adult nervous systems than previously thought. Their balanced integration leads to new models for "critical or sensitive" period phenomena and behavioral biases. A general understanding of behavioral development - cognitive developmental biology - will require better coordination between comparative animal and human developmental research programs.

Thalidomide has been shown to decrease this inflammation by the suppression of TNF-alpha secretion. However, side effects associated with thalidomide have precluded its widespread usage. In the present study we investigated the efficacy of a "targeted delivery approach" for thalidomide at the site of inflammation. We observed that alginate-poly-l-lysine-alginate (APA) polymer-based microcapsule formulations that encapsulate thalidomide could be designed. These capsules could be delivered at target sites where they almost entirely suppress TNF-alpha secretion in lipopolysaccharide activated RAW 264.7 macrophage cells in vitro. These findings indicate that targeted delivery of thalidomide using APA capsules could facilitate its usage in reducing the inflammation associated with chronic conditions such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.

Our goal was to analyze high-frequency activity recorded with electroencephalograph (EEG) macroelectrodes during the slow wave immediately following interictal spikes, given the potential importance of this presumed hyperpolarization in transforming spikes into seizures. Methods: Depth electrode EEG recordings from 10 patients with intractable focal epilepsy were low-pass filtered at 500 Hz and sampled at 2,000 Hz. Spikes were categorized according to localization and morphology. Segments of 256 ms were selected immediately following (postspike), and 2 s before each spike (baseline). Power was estimated in subgamma (0-40 Hz), gamma (40-100 Hz), high frequency (100-200 Hz), and very high frequency (250-500 Hz) bands. Results: Changes in power above 100 Hz were seen in 22 of 29 spike categories, consisting primarily of a widespread decrease in frequencies above 100 Hz. This decrease became spatially more restricted as frequencies increased, and coincided with the localization of largest spikes for the highest frequencies. High-frequency power decreases were prominent in the hippocampus but less common in amygdala and neocortex. High-frequency power increases were observed in the amygdala. Conclusions: Thus high-frequency EEG activity can be recorded with macroelectrodes in humans and may provide insights on neuronal mechanisms related to human epilepsy. This activity undergoes consistent modifications after EEG spikes. We propose that the reduction in high frequencies reflects a postspike depression in neuronal activity that is more pronounced in the region of spike generation. This depression is almost always seen in hippocampus but less in amygdala.

Safety and pharmacokinetics of temozolomide using a dose-escalation, metronomic schedule in recurrent paediatric brain tumours	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CANCER			English	Article						temozolomide; metronomic; brain tumour; child; dose escalation	PHASE-II TRIAL; MALIGNANT GLIOMA; POPULATION PHARMACOKINETICS; ANTITUMOR IMIDAZOTETRAZINES; GLIOBLASTOMA-MULTIFORME; ADJUVANT TEMOZOLOMIDE; 1ST RELAPSE; CANCER; ANGIOGENESIS; CHEMOTHERAPY	The aims of this study were to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), toxicity and pharmacokinetics of oral temozolomide administered over 42 d in children with recurrent/ refractory brain tumours. Cohorts of 3-6 patients were treated for 42 d, followed by a 7-d rest period for a maximum of 6 cycles. Patients were stratified as heavily pre-treated (HPT) and non-heavily pre-treated (NHPT). Starting doses were 50 mg/m(2) (HPT) or 75 mg/m(2) (NHPT). Out of 28 patients enrolled, 20 were evaluable for toxicity and 19 for pharmacokinetics. Three patients in the NHPT group developed grade 3/4 haematological toxicity, 2 experienced dose-limiting toxicity (thrombocytopenia) at 100 mg/m(2), and 9/20 developed grade 3 lymphopenia. MTD in both strata was 85 mg/m(2). Responses were observed in 4 patients: 2 complete responses (CR) in medulloblastoma and supratentorial primitive neuroectodermal tumours (PNET), and 2 partial responses (PR) in high-grade glioma, respectively. Overall cumulative exposure was at least 1.5 times higher than in the 5-d administration schedule. In conclusion, the recommended dose of temozolomide is 85 mg/m(2) x 42 d. Dose-limiting toxicities are thrombocytopenia and lymphopenia. The observed response rate warrants phase II studies. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Genetic variations in the LPL gene were previously associated to lipid imbalance and coronary artery disease (CAD) risk and severity, a condition that shares pathological features with common Alzheimer's disease (AD). To evaluate whether these genetic variations associate with the risk and pathophysiology of common AD, autopsy-confirmed patients (242 controls, 153 AD) were genotyped for a PvuII single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP; rs285; referred to as the P+ allele) of LPL. Brain LPL mRNA levels, cholesterol levels, amyloid concentration, senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles density counts were measured and contrasted with specific LPL genotypes. When adjusted for age and sex, homozygosity for the P+ allele resulted in an odds ratio of 2.3 for the risk of developing AD. More importantly, we report that the presence of the P+ allele of LPL significantly affects its mRNA expression level (n = 51; P = 0.026), brain tissue cholesterol levels (n = 55; P = 0.0013), neurofibrillary tangles (n = 52; P = 0.025) and senile plaque (n = 52; P = 0.022) densities. These results indicate that a common polymorphism in the lipoprotein lipase gene modulates the risk level for sporadic AD in the eastern Canadian population but more importantly, indirectly modulates the pathophysiology of the brain in autopsy-confirmed cases.

Since synaptic density correlates more closely with cognitive impairment than any other pathological lesion observable in the disease pathology, an increased understanding of the mechanisms behind synaptic disconnection is of vital importance. Our lab investigated the neurotransmitter-specific status of distinct cortical presynaptic bouton populations in various transgenic mouse models of the Alzheimer's-like amyloid pathology in order to assess their involvement throughout the progression of the pathology. These studies have revealed that the amyloid pathology appears to progress in a neurotransmitter-specific manner where the cholinergic terminals appear most vulnerable, followed by the glutamatergic terminals and finally by the somewhat more resilient GABAergic terminals. This review will discuss additional studies which also provide evidence of a neurotransmitter-specific pathology as well as comment on the potential explanations for the observed vulnerabilities, touching upon metabolic demand, trophic support and receptor mediated activation.

Recently, a few functional brain imaging studies have tackled the issue of gender differences as pertaining to reactions to erotica. The question of whether or not gender differences in reactions to erotica are maintained with women in different phases has not yet been answered from a functional brain imaging perspective. In order to examine this issue, functional MRI was performed in 22 male and 22 female volunteers. Subjects viewed erotic film excerpts alternating with emotionally neutral excerpts in a standard block-design paradigm. Arousal to erotic stimuli was evaluated using standard rating scales after scanning. Two-sample t-test with uncorrected P < 0.001 values for a priori determined region of interests involved in processing of erotic stimuli and with corrected P < 0.05 revealed gender differences: Comparing women in mid-luteal phase and during their menses, superior activation was revealed for women in mid-luteal phase in the anterior cingulate, left insula, and orbitofrontal cortex. A superior activation for men was found in the left thalamus, the bilateral amygdala, the anterior cingulate, the bilateral orbitofrontal, bilateral parahippocampal, and insular regions, which were maintained at a corrected P in the amygdala, the insula, and thalamus. There were no areas of significant superior activation for women neither in mid-luteal phase nor during their menses. Our results indicate that there are differences between women in the two cycle times in cerebral activity during viewing of erotic stimuli. Furthermore, gender differences with women in mid-luteal phases are similar to those in females outside the mid-luteal phase.

Threshold control of motor actions prevents destabilizing effects of proprioceptive delays	EXPERIMENTAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						sensorimotor integration; threshold control; stability; equilibrium-point hypothesis; feed-forward processes	EQUILIBRIUM-POINT HYPOTHESIS; ELECTRO-MECHANICAL DELAY; STRETCH REFLEX; ARM MOVEMENTS; SKELETAL-MUSCLES; DECEREBRATE CAT; VOLUNTARY; ACTIVATION; PARAMETERS; VELOCITY	It is usually assumed that proprioceptive feedback comes to motoneurons too late to contribute to the initial activity of agonist muscles during fast arm movements, leading to the suggestion that this feedback is only efficient in slow movements and postural control. The argument does not take into account that the changes in the motoneuronal membrane potentials and the associated changes in the state of spinal neurons preceding the initial activity of muscles deeply affect, in a forward way, the state of reflex systems by shifting their thresholds, as suggested in the lambda model for motor control. As a result, the initial muscle activity emerges with full contribution of these systems so that the effects of reflex delays become negligible. We tested the hypothesis that threshold control of muscle activation may be instrumental in preventing destabilizing effects of proprioceptive delays in spinal and trans-cortical pathways to motoneurons. The analysis was made by recording fast elbow movements (peak velocity similar to 300-500 degrees/s) and simulating them in a dynamic model that incorporates the notion of threshold control of intrinsic and reflex muscle properties. The model was robust in reproducing experimental movement patterns (R-2 > 0.95). It generated stable output despite substantial proprioceptive (up to 100 ms) and electromechanical (40 ms) delays. Stability was thus ensured for delays not only in segmental (about 25-50 ms) but also in trans-cortical loops (50-70 ms). Our study illustrates that a natural physiological process-threshold control-may manifest feed-forward properties hitherto attributed to hypothetical internal neural models.

However, their neurogenic potential, including their ability to produce electrophysiologically active neurons, is largely unexplored. We investigated this issue with regard to skin-derived precursors (SKPs), multipotent NC-related precursors isolated from the dermis of skin. SKP cultures follow an appropriate pattern and time-course of neuronal differentiation, with proliferating nestin-expressing SKPs generating post-mitotic neuronal cells that co-express pan-neuronal and peripheral autonomic lineage markers. These SKP-derived neuron-like cells survive and maintain their peripheral phenotype for at least 5 weeks when transplanted into the CNS environment of normal or kainate-in jured hippocampal slices. Undifferentiated SKPs retain key neural precursor proper-ties after multi-passage expansion, including growth factor dependence, nestin expression, neurogenic potential, and responsiveness to embryonic neural crest fate determinants. Despite undergoing an apparently appropriate neurogenic process, however, SKP-detived neuron-like cells possess an immature electrophysiological profile. These findings indicate that SKPs retain latent neurogenic properties after residing in a non-neural tissue, but that additional measures will be necessary to promote their differentiation into electrophysiologically active neurons.

Among neural cells, astrocytes are one of the main sources of MMPs in physiological and postlesional conditions. However, no data are available on the possible role of MMPs in astrocyte motility. Using an in vitro model of 2D migration and broad spectrum and selective MMP inhibitors, the authors demonstrated that MMP-2, but not MMP-9, is a key enzyme for astrocyte migration. In support of these data, the authors found constitutive expression of MMP-2 in astrocytes, while MMP-9 was nearly undetectable by gel zymography and immunocytochemical methods. The inhibition of migration by MMP inhibitors correlated with changes in cell morphology and in the organization of the actin cytoskeleton. In parallel, the characteristic focalized distribution of MMP-2 at the migration front observed in control cells became more diffuse and internalized by treatments that inhibited migration. The disruption of actin by cytochalasin D caused the partial recruitment of MMP-2 and gelatinolytic activity into actin aggregates, indicating a connection between the proteinase and the actin cytoskeleton. Finally, the authors found a co-localization of beta 1-integrin with MMP-2 at the leading edge of migrating astrocytes. Altogether, these data provide the first evidence for the implication of MMP-2 in astrocyte motility, probably through the interaction of the proteinase with beta 1-integrin that could act as a linker between pericellular proteolysis and the actin cytoskeleton.

Upregulation of astrocytic basic fibroblast growth factor in the cingulate cortex of lactating rats: Time course and role of suckling stimulation	HORMONES AND BEHAVIOR			English	Article						glia; neurotrophic factors; plasticity; reproduction; maternal behavior; cortex	MATERNAL-BEHAVIOR; MOTOR CORTEX; FEMALE RATS; EXPERIENCE; BLOCKADE; LESIONS; MEMORY; HYPOTHALAMUS; OVARIECTOMY; MOTHERHOOD	Previous work from our laboratory has shown that there is a much higher level of bFGF and GFAP immunoreactivity in area 2 of the cingulate cortex (Cg2) of rats on day 16 of lactation than in cycling or late pregnant females. To examine the time course of this change, in the first of the current studies, we compared bFGF and GFAP immunoreactivity in the brains of lactating females on postpartum day 4 (PP4), day 10 (PP10), day 16 (PP16), and day 24 (PP24) with that of cycling and ovariectomized (OVX) females. In the second study, we investigated whether the maintenance of these changes in bFGF and GFAP depended on suckling stimulation by removing litters on day 1 or day 16 postpartum and examining the brains of the dams on day 4 (Pr4) or day 24 (Pr24) postpartum, respectively. bFGF and GFAP immunoreactivity within Cg2 and the medial preoptic area (MPOA) were measured. In both experiments astrocytic bFGF and GFAP surface density in the Cg2 varied significantly across groups. All postpartum rats, regardless of stage of lactation or presence of the litter, had significantly higher levels of bFGF and GFAP immunoreactivity than cycling animals. Thus, the maintenance of this upregulation in bFGF and GFAP immunoreactivity does not depend on suckling stimulation. Consistent with our previous report, astrocytic bFGF was also elevated in the MPOA of PP 16 animals. These data suggest a robust, long-lasting, postpartum change in bFGF and GFAP immunoreactivity in Cg2 and a role for this area of the cortex in the physiological and behavioral adaptations that accompany reproductive experience.

We previously identified a novel angiotensin II type 1 receptor-associated protein and demonstrated that it promotes receptor recycling to the plasma membrane. To delineate the pathophysiological function of the ARAP1 in the kidneys, we generated transgenic mice that overexpress rat ARAP1 cDNA specifically in proximal tubules and tested the hypothesis that proximal tubule-specific overexpression of ARAP1 causes hypertension. Two lines of male transgenic mice, 650 and 670, displayed kidney-specific transgene expression. Systolic blood pressure was significantly elevated by approximate to 20 to 25 mm Hg in these lines of mice at 20 weeks of age compared with their nontransgenic litter mates. Urine volume, but not water intake, was significantly decreased in both lines compared with nontransgenic controls. The kidney/body weight ratio was significantly increased in both lines compared with their nontransgenic litter mates at 12 and 20 weeks of age. In contrast, no difference was observed in the ratio of brain, spleen, heart, and testis to body weight between male transgenic and nontransgenic animals. Inhibitions of the renin-angiotensin system completely normalized the systolic blood pressure of transgenic mice. Moreover, low salt intake prevented the development of hypertension, whereas high salt intake exacerbated the increase in blood pressure in transgenic mice. Therefore, our data show that proximal tubule-specific overexpression of ARAP1 leads to hypertension, suggesting that renal ARAP1 plays an important role in the regulation of blood pressure and renal function via activation of the intrarenal renin-angiotensin system.

Materials and methods: Twenty-one extensive mobile phone users (average use=5.5 +/- 2.2 years at 2.4 +/- 1.1 hours/day) and 15 control subjects were recruited and submitted to a 1 H MRS brain examination at 1.5 Tesla. Data were recorded in the most exposed right temporal and pontobulbar areas as well as in the contralateral left temporal area. The ratios of N-acetylaspartate (NAA), choline (Cho) and myo-inositol (mI) to creatine/phosphocreatine (Cr) were measured. Results: No statistically significant changes in the NAA/Cr, Cho/Cr and mI/Cr ratios were measured between mobile phone users and control subjects and between the exposed and contralateral temporal areas. Conclusion: These results indicate that extensive exposition to mobile phone radiation does not cause MRS-detectable brain metabolic changes.

J	Oliveira, LS; Morita, M; Sabourin, R				Oliveira, Luiz S.; Morita, Marisa; Sabourin, Robert			Feature selection for ensembles applied to handwriting recognition	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL ON DOCUMENT ANALYSIS AND RECOGNITION			English	Article						ensemble of classifiers; feature selection; handwriting recognition; multi-objective optimization; genetic algorithms	GENETIC ALGORITHMS; CLASSIFIER ENSEMBLES; DIVERSITY; SYSTEMS; FUSION	Feature selection for ensembles has shown to be an effective strategy for ensemble creation clue to its ability of producing good subsets of features, which make the classifiers of the ensemble disagree on difficult cases. In this paper we present an ensemble feature selection approach based on a hierarchical multi-objective genetic algorithm. The underpinning paradigm is the "overproduce and choose". The algorithm operates in two levels. Firstly, it performs feature selection in order to generate a set of classifiers and then it chooses the best team of classifiers. In order to show its robustness, the method is evaluated in two different contexts: supervised and unsupervised feature selection. In the former, we have considered the problem of handwritten digit recognition and used three different feature sets and multi-layer perceptron neural networks as classifiers. In the latter, we took into account the problem of handwritten month word recognition and used three different feature sets and hidden Markov models as classifiers. Experiments and comparisons with classical methods, such as Bagging and Boosting, demonstrated that the proposed methodology brings compelling improvements when classifiers have to work with very low error rates. Comparisons have been done by considering the recognition rates only.

The combustion of MMT leads to increased manganese (Mn) concentrations in the atmosphere, and represents one of the main sources of human exposure to Mn. The nervous system is the major target of the toxicity of Mn and Mn compounds. The purpose of this study was to investigate exposure-response relationships for neuropathology and tremor, and the associated electromyogram (EMG), following subchronic inhalation exposure of rats to a mixture of Mn phosphate/sulfate particles. Rats were exposed 6 h per day, 5 days per week for 13 consecutive weeks at 30, 300 or 3000 mu g m(-3) Mn phosphate/sulfate mixture and compared with controls. Half of the rats had EMG electrodes implanted in the gastrocnemius muscle of the hind limb to assess tremor at the end of Mn exposure. Two days after the end of Mn exposure, rats were killed by exsanguination and Mn concentrations in the brain (caudate putamen, globus pallidus and frontal cortex) were determined by neutron activation analysis while neuropathology was assessed by counting neuronal cells in 2.5 mm X 2.5 nun grid areas. Increased Mn concentrations were observed in all brain sections at the highest level of exposure. The neuronal cell loss was significantly different in the globus pallidus and the caudate putamen at the highest level of exposure (3000 mu g m(-3)). No sign of tremor was observed among the rats. In conclusion, exposure to a high level of Mn phosphate/sulfate mixture brought on neuropathological changes in a specific area of the brain; however, no sign of tremor was observed.

Bacteriophages have proven a useful alternative therapy in other domains, but remain to be tested with fish. The interaction between Aeromonas salmonicida HER 1107, bacteriophage HER 110, and brook trout Salvelinus fontinalis was studied in 70-L aquariums maintained at 9 degrees C. Populations of A. salmonicida (10(8) colony-forming units per milliliter) declined by six log units (base 10) in 3 d when bacteriophage HER 110 was introduced in a multiplicity of infection factor of 1. Concentrations of bacteriophages and bacteria in the open water of the aquariums were 2-3 log units lower than those in gravel interstitial water. However, the relative drop in bacterial populations with time was the same in both environments. Addition of the bacteriophage HER 110 delayed by 7 d the onset of furunculosis in brook trout. Further addition of A. salmonicida HER 1107 showed that bacteriophages remained in the aquariums. Mutants of the bacterium were isolated and used as targets for bacteriophage HER 110 and nine other phages. The tests revealed that more than one phage could infect A. samonicida HER 1107 and that mutants resistant to bacteriophage HER 110 were sensitive to one or more phages. Bacteria resistant to bacteriophage HER 110 had a slower generation time than the original strain, and the success rate of replating in tryptic soy agar (TSA) was very low. More than 25% of the mutants seemed to revert to the original-strain phenotype after a first replating in TSA. All mutants were sensitive to three or more phages. Finally, stock cultures of 109 plaque-forming units per milliliter of bacteriophage HER 110 decreased by only one log unit in 80 d when held at 4 degrees C in liquid brain-heart infusion broth culture medium. These results suggest that bacteriophage combinations could be successfully used in preventive programs on fish farms.

Membership functions and their weights are derived from the characteristics of radar echoes as a function of radar reflectivity. The dependence on echo intensity is shown to significantly improve the proper identification of GRE/AP. In addition, the proposed method has a better performance at lower elevation angles. The overall performance is comparable with that from a polarimetric approach and can thus be easily implemented in operational radars.

Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 deficiency results in dysregulated erythropoiesis signaling and iron homeostasis in mouse development	JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							TRANSFERRIN RECEPTOR GENE; TRANSCRIPTIONAL ACTIVATION; POLYCYTHEMIA MICE; EMBRYOS LACKING; YOLK-SAC; OXYGEN; VEGF; EXPRESSION; GROWTH; BLOOD	Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) regulates the transcription of genes whose products play critical roles in energy metabolism, erythropoiesis, angiogenesis, and cell survival. Limited information is available concerning its function in mammalian hematopoiesis. Previous studies have demonstrated that homozygosity for a targeted null mutation in the Hif1 alpha gene, which encodes the hypoxia-responsive alpha subunit of HIF-1, causes cardiac, vascular, and neural malformations resulting in lethality by embryonic day 10.5 (E10.5). This study revealed reduced myeloid multilineage and committed erythroid progenitors in HIF-1 alpha-deficient embryos, as well as decreased hemoglobin content in erythroid colonies from HIF-1 alpha-deficient yolk sacs at E9.5. Dysregulation of erythropoietin (Epo) signaling was evident from a significant decrease in mRNA levels of Epo receptor (EpoR) in Hif1 alpha(-/-) yolk sac as well as Epo and EpoR mRNA in Hif1 alpha(-/-) embryos. The erythropoietic defects in HIF-1 alpha-deficient erythroid colonies could not be corrected by cytokines, such as vascular endothelial growth factor and Epo, but were ameliorated by Fe-SIH, a compound delivering iron into cells independently of iron transport proteins. Consistent with profound defects in iron homeostasis, Hif1 alpha(-/-) yolk sac and/or embryos demonstrated aberrant mRNA levels of hepcidin, Fpn1, Irp1, and frascati. We conclude that dysregulated expression of genes encoding Epo, EpoR, and iron regulatory proteins contributes to defective erythropoiesis in Hif1 alpha(-/-) yolk sacs. These results identify a novel role for HIF-1 in the regulation of iron homeostasis and reveal unexpected regulatory differences in Epo/EpoR signaling in yolk sac and embryonic erythropoiesis.

This suggests the use of a sequential LBL strategy, in sharp contrast with the parallel letter processing used by normal subjects. Recently, we have proposed that the reading difficulty of LBL dyslexics is due to a deficit in discriminating visually similar letters based on parallel letter processing [Arguin, M., Fiset, S., & Bub, D. Sequential and parallel letter processing in letter-by-letter dyslexia. Cognitive Neuropsychology, 19, 535-555, 2002]. The visual mechanisms underlying this deficit and the LBL strategy, however, are still unknown. In this article, we propose that LBL dyslexic patients have lost the ability to use, for parallel letter processing, the optimal spatial frequency band for letter and word recognition. We claim that, instead, they rely on lower spatial frequencies for parallel processing, that these lower spatial frequencies produce confusions between visually similar letters, and that the LBL compensatory strategy allows them to extract higher spatial frequencies. The LBL strategy would thus increase the spatial resolution of the visual system, effectively resolving the issue pertaining to between-letter similarity. In Experiments I and 2, we succeeded in replicating the main features characterizing LBL dyslexia by having normal individuals read low-contrast, high-pass-filtered words. Experiment 3, conducted in LBL dyslexic L.H., shows that, indeed, the letter confusability effect is based on low spatial frequencies, whereas this effect was not supported by high spatial frequencies.

JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION DISORDERS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Annual Meeting of the American-Speech-Language-Hearing-Association	NOV, 2005	San Diego, CA	Amer Speech Language Hearing Assoc			TRIGEMINAL MOTOR NUCLEUS; FICTIVE MASTICATION; RETICULAR-FORMATION; DISCHARGE PATTERNS; RHYTHM GENERATION; JAW MOVEMENT; NEURONS; RABBIT; INTERNEURONS; RAT	Mastication results from the interaction of an intrinsic rhythmical neural pattern and sensory feedback from the mouth, muscles and joints. The pattern is matched to the physical characteristics of food, but also varies with age. There are large differences in masticatory movements among subjects. The intrinsic rhythmical pattern is generated by an assembly of neurons called a central pattern generator (CPG) located in the pons and medulla. The CPG receives inputs from higher centers of the brain, especially from the inferio-lateral region of the sensorimotor cortex and from sensory receptors. Mechanoreceptors in the lips and oral mucosa, in muscles, and in the periodontal ligaments around the roots of the teeth have particularly powerful effects on movement parameters. The central pattern generator includes a core group of neurons with intrinsic bursting properties, as well as a variety of other neurons that receive inputs from oral and muscle spindle afferents. Reorganization of subpopulations of neurons within the CPG underlies changes in movement pattern. In addition to controlling motoneurons supplying the jaw, tongue, and facial muscles, the CPG also modulates reflex circuits. It is proposed that these brainstem circuits also participate in the control of human speech. Learning outcomes: Readers will be able to: (1) describe the general location and function of the central pattern generator for mastication, (2) identify the primary nuclei involved in the central pattern generator for mastication, (3) describe the general interactions among the central pattern generators of speech, mastication, respiration, and locomotion, and (4) compare/relate the brainstem systems controlling mastication and speech.

JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SPEECH-LANGUAGE PATHOLOGY			English	Article							BRAIN-DAMAGED PATIENTS; CEREBRAL HEMISPHERES; LEXICAL AMBIGUITY; COMPREHENSION; ASYMMETRIES; ACTIVATION; LANGUAGE; CONTEXT	This study assessed the possibility that the processing of metaphoric alternative meanings of ambiguous words may be differentiated from the processing of their nonmetaphoric alternative meanings. Two factors were studied in order to find a possible difference: the neural bases and the behavioral aspects of such processing. Thirty-five participants performed a priming task in which pairs of words were related by their dominant, metaphoric alternative or nonmetaphoric alternative meanings. Stimuli were presented according to a divided visual field paradigm. Analysis did not reveal any differences in hemispheric contributions, probably because of an insufficient stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA). Analysis of the behavioral results showed a difference between ambiguous words with a metaphoric alternative meaning and those with a nonmetaphoric alternative meaning: for the former, the different interpretations were accessed hierarchically, while for the latter, the different interpretations were accessed in parallel. This behavioral difference in the processing of metaphoric and nonmetaphoric alternative meanings suggests that these two types of ambiguous words are processed differently.

Characterization of the localization and function of NECAP 1 in neurons	JOURNAL OF NEUROCHEMISTRY			English	Article						adaptin ear binding clathrin associated protein 1; adaptor protein-2; endocytosis; neurons	CLATHRIN-MEDIATED ENDOCYTOSIS; SYNAPTIC VESICLE ENDOCYTOSIS; GROWTH-FACTOR RECEPTOR; ELECTROPHORETIC TRANSFER; CULTURED HIPPOCAMPAL; POLYACRYLAMIDE GELS; COATED VESICLES; PROTEINS; ADAPTER; MEMBRANE	NECAPs (adaptin ear-binding clathrin-associated protein) are a new family of clathrin accessory proteins identified through a proteomic analysis of clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs) from the brain. One member of this family, NECAP 1, is found primarily in tissues from the central nervous system and has been shown to be complexed tightly with a substantial portion of adaptor protein-2 (AP-2) in brain extracts. However, the function and intracellular location of this protein is unknown. In this study, we find that endogenous and epitope-tagged NECAP 1 co-localizes well with clathrin and AP-2 in punctate structures, many of which also contain the presynaptic markers synaptophysin, synaptotagmin or synaptic vesicle protein 2 (SV2). NECAP 1 was also detected by western blot in synaptic vesicle preparations. Overexpression of a truncation mutant of NECAP 1 (BC-NECAP 1) in neurons inhibited transferrin endocytosis but not epidermal growth factor (EGF) endocytosis, and this inhibition was dependent on an AP-2-binding WVQF motif. Moreover, overexpression of BC-NECAP 1 results in inhibition of synaptotagmin endocytosis both in unstimulated neurons and in neurons stimulated with potassium chloride. This inhibition was abrogated by truncation of the WVQF domain. We conclude from these observations that NECAP 1 plays a role in clathrin-mediated neuronal endocytosis, including a role in presynaptic endocytosis.

Central resetting of neuromuscular steady states may underlie rhythmical arm movements	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article							CHRONIC SPINAL CATS; MOTOR CONTROL; INTERLIMB COORDINATION; BIMANUAL COORDINATION; CUTANEOUS REFLEXES; EXTENSOR MUSCLES; HUMAN LOCOMOTION; DECEREBRATE CAT; STRETCH REFLEX; SWING PHASE	Changing the steady-state configuration of the body or its segments may be an important function of central pattern generators for locomotion and other rhythmical movements. Thereby, muscle activation, forces, and movement may emerge following a natural tendency of the neuromuscular system to achieve the current steady-state configuration. To verify that transitions between different steady states occur during rhythmical movements, we asked standing subjects to swing one or both arms synchronously or reciprocally at similar to 0.8 Hz from the shoulder joints. In randomly selected cycles, one arm was transiently arrested by an electromagnetic device. Swinging resumed after some delay and phase resetting. During bilateral swinging, the nonperturbed arm often stopped before resuming swinging at a position that was close to either the extreme forward or the extreme backward arm position observed before the perturbation. Oscillations usually resumed when both arms arrived at similar extreme positions when a synchronous bilateral pattern was initially produced or at the opposite positions if the initial pattern was reciprocal. Results suggest that a central generator controls both arms as a coherent unit by producing transitions between its steady state (equilibrium) positions. By controlling these positions, the system may define the spatial boundaries of movement. At these positions, the system may halt the oscillations, resume them at a new phase (as observed in the present study), or initiate a new motor action. Our findings are relevant to locomotion and suggest that walking may also be generated by transitions between several equilibrium configurations of the body, possibly accomplished by modulation and gating of proprioceptive reflexes.

A reconsideration of the relevance of systemic low-dose ketamine to the pathophysiology of fibromyalgia	JOURNAL OF PAIN			English	Article						fibromyalgia; ketamine; n-methyl-d-aspartate receptor; doparnine; central sensitization	IDIOPATHIC PARKINSONS-DISEASE; CHRONIC WIDESPREAD PAIN; TEMPORAL SUMMATION; RESTLESS LEGS; DOPAMINE; CORTEX; RAT; SENSITIZATION; STIMULATION; DISORDERS	Fibromyalgia is a common disorder characterized by chronic widespread pain that affects an estimated 2% of the general population. Recent advances have shed insight on this mysterious disorder, leading to the growing conclusion that disturbances of pain-related processes within the central nervous system, termed central sensitization, represent its most likely source. The phenomenon of central sensitization depends on plasticity in function of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) subtype glutamate receptors. Earlier studies implicated increased sensitivity of central NMDA receptors as playing a primary role in fibromyalgia, as evidenced by a significant reduction in symptoms among a large subset of patients in response to low doses of ketamine, a noncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonist. However, recent insights into the pharmacology of this drug cast doubt on a direct contribution of NMDA receptors and add credence to a model of the disorder that suggests that the primary pathology of fibromyalgia is a suppression of the normal activity of dopamine-releasing neurons within the limbic system. The implications for future therapies for fibromyalgia, and indeed many other chronic pain conditions, are discussed in light of these insights. Perspective: The current lack of a demonstrable pathology underlying the pain of fibromyalgia has hampered progress toward adequate treatment of this mysterious disorder. Accumulating evidence suggests that fibromyalgia may represent a dysregulation of dopaminergic neurotransmission, which may provide insights to guide both rational clinical interventions as well as system-specific research models.

Study design Infants weighing < 1000 g birth weight were randomly assigned within 48 hours of birth to a transfusion algorithm of either low or high hemoglobin transfusion thresholds. The composite primary outcome was death before home discharge or survival with any of either severe retinopathv, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, or brain injury on cranial ultrasound. Morbidity outcomes were assessed, blinded to allocation. Results Four hundred fifty-one infants were randomly assigned to low (n = 223) or high (n = 228) hemoglobin thresholds. Groups were similar, with mean birth weight of 770 g and gestational age of 26 weeks. Fewer infants received one or more transfusions in the low threshold group (89% low versus 95% high, P =.037). Rates of the primary outcome were 74.0% in the low threshold-group and 69.7% in the high (P =.25; risk difference, 2.7%; 95% Cl -3.7% to 9.2%). There were no statistically significant differences between groups in any secondary outcome. Conclusions In extremely low birth weight infants, maintaining a higher hemoglobin level results in more infants receiving transfusions but confers little evidence of benefit.

The present study was undertaken to assess whether cryoablation of the endothelial lining could prevent recanalization after coil occlusion. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Recanalization rates of canine maxillary and vertebral arteries (n = 20) occluded with platinum coils with or without previous cryoablation (with temperatures of -40 degrees C to -45 degrees C for 90 seconds) were analyzed by angiography immediately and at 1 and 3 months in five animals. Pathologic recanalization and fibrosis was assessed at 3 months with use of a qualitative scoring system. Findings were compared with Mann-Whitney tests. RESULTS: Recartalization after coil occlusion occurred in 50% and 60% of cases with cryoablation at 1 and 3 months, respectively, compared with 100% without ablation (P = .012 and P = .029). There was no significant difference in pathologic scores (P = .348). The brachial plexus in the vicinity of vertebral arteries was injured by cryotherapy in three animals in which an ipsilateral neurologic deficit developed. CONCLUSIONS: Cryotherapy was moderately effective in the prevention of recanalization after coil occlusion. Deep nerve injury was excessive with the protocol used in the present study.

From a neurobiological perspective, this amnesia is usually attributed to the absence of memory consolidation, that is, memory storage. An alternative view holds that this impairment reflects that the memory is present but cannot be retrieved. This debate has been unresolved for decades. Here, we will consider some of the arguments that make it so difficult to resolve this issue. In addition, some recent work will be discussed that has gone beyond the shortcomings of previous experimental approaches to strongly suggest that amnesia can be due to a retrieval impairment that can be overcome with a reminder-an example of memories fading in. Finally, this review will Suggest some strategies for resolving this debate.

Interactions of Aspergillus fumigatus with vascular endothelial cells	MEDICAL MYCOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	2nd Advances against Aspergillosis Conference	FEB 22-25, 2006	Athens, GREECE			invasive; aspergillosis; endothelial cells	BRAIN	Invasive aspergillosis is characterized by two different types of angioinvasion. During pulmonary aspergillosis, hyphae are initially outside of the pulmonary vasculature and they invade the endothelial cell lining of the blood vessels by passing from the abluminal to the luminal surface. Some of these hyphal fragments can break off and circulate in the bloodstream. In severely immunocompromised hosts, these blood-borne hyphal fragments adhere to the luminal surface of the endothelial cells and they penetrate the endothelial cell lining of the vasculature by passing from the luminal to the abluminal surface. We have set up in vitro models of luminal and abluminal endothelial cell invasion by Aspergillus fumigatus. Luminal invasion by hyphae results in both endothelial cell damage and stimulation of tissue factor expression. Abluminal invasion causes less endothelial cell damage than luminal invasion, but greater induction of endothelial cells genes encoding cytokines, leukocyte adhesion molecules and tissue factor. These differences in the endothelial cell response to luminal versus abluminal infection may indicate significant differences in the pathogenesis of hematogenously disseminated versus locally invasive versus aspergillosis.

A realistic phantom for brain-shift simulations	MEDICAL PHYSICS			English	Article							ULTRASOUND; GUIDANCE	Validation of techniques that characterize and correct for brain shift for image guided surgery requires a realistic anthropomorphic phantom for use as a gold standard. The purpose of this study was to determine the characteristics of a deformable brain phantom made of polyvinyl alcohol cryogel (PVAc). The phantom was made of three layers of PVAc with inserted plastic tubes to simulate blood vessels. A catheter with an inflatable balloon was placed under the phantom in order to deform it in a nonlinear manner. The reproducibility of the elastic deformation was evaluated using MR imaging and surface measurements. Our experiments show that the phantom is well suited for MR and ultrasound imaging (B-mode and Doppler) with sub-millimeter reproducibility for the deformations.

The neurotransmitter serotonin or 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) is involved in the pathophysiology of depression and in the effects of antidepressant treatments. However, molecular alterations that underlie the pathology or treatment of depression are still poorly understood. The TREK-1 protein is a background K(+) channel regulated by various neurotransmitters including 5-HT. In mice, the deletion of its gene (Kcnk2, also called TREK-1) led to animals with an increased efficacy of 5-HT neurotransmission and a resistance to depression in five different models and a substantially reduced elevation of corticosterone levels under stress. TREK-1-deficient (Kcnk2(-/-)) mice showed behavior similar to that of naive animals treated with classical antidepressants such as fluoxetine. Our results indicate that alterations in the functioning, regulation or both of the TREK-1 channel may alter mood, and that this particular K(+) channel may be a potential target for new antidepressants.

Increased levels of pregnenolone and its neuroactive metabolite allopregnanolone in autopsied brain tissue from cirrhotic patients who died in hepatic coma	NEUROCHEMISTRY INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						hepatic encephalopathy; allopregnanolone; pregnenolone; GABAergic tone; [3(H)]-muscimol; benzodiazepines; liver failure; cirrhosis	GABA-A RECEPTOR; DIAZEPAM-BINDING INHIBITOR; GAMMA-AMINOBUTYRIC-ACID; ACUTE LIVER-FAILURE; BENZODIAZEPINE-RECEPTOR; OCTADECANEUROPEPTIDE ODN; DOUBLE-BLIND; ENCEPHALOPATHY; PROGESTERONE; RAT	It has been suggested that neurosteroids with agonist properties at the central GABA-A receptor are implicated in the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy (HE) in chronic liver disease. In order to address this issue, gas chromatography/mass spectrometry was used to measure the neurosteroids pregnenolone, allopregnanolone, and tetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone (THDOC) in postmortem brain tissue from controls, cirrhotic patients who died without HE, a patient who died in uremic coma, and cirrhotic patients who died in hepatic coma. Exposure of rat cerebral cortical membranes to brain extracts from hepatic coma patients resulted in a 53% (p < 0.001) increase in binding of [H-3]muscimol, a GABA-A receptor ligand. Subsequent GC/MS analysis showed that concentrations of the GABA-A receptor agonist neurosteroid allopregnanolone were significantly increased in brain tissue from hepatic coma patients compared to patients without HE or controls (p < 0.001). Brain allopregnanolone concentrations were significantly correlated with the magnitude of induction of [3 H]muscimol binding (r(2) = 0.82, p < 0.0001). Concentrations of allopregnanolone comparable to those observed in hepatic coma brains are pathophysiologically relevant. Concentrations of the neurosteroid precursor pregnenolone were also increased in brain tissue from hepatic coma patients, while those of a second neurosteroid THDOC were below the levels of detection in all groups. Brain concentrations of benzodiazepine receptor ligands estimated by radioreceptor assay were not significantly increased in cirrhotic patients with or without hepatic coma. These findings suggest that increased levels of allopregnanolone rather than "endogenous benzodiazepines" offer a cogent explanation for the phenomenon of "increased GABAergic tone" previously proposed in HE.

I-h modulates neuron excitability and rhythmicity. It is, however, unclear whether the net effect of changing Ih leads to facilitation or depression of cortical epileptiform activity. Here, we addressed this issue by using field and intracellular recordings to study the effects of ZD7288 (10-100 mu M), a bradycardic agent known to abolish I-h, on the epileptiform discharges (duration = 2.5 +/- 0.3 s, mean +/- SEM; interval of occurrence = 34.2 +/- 3.3 s, n = 30 slices) induced in rat neocortical slices by 4-aminopyridine and GABA receptor antagonists. ZD7288 abolished the depolarizing sags seen during injection of intracellular hyperpolarizing current pulses while increasing resting membrane potential and apparent input resistance. These effects, which were fully established with 10 mu M ZD7288, were associated with a dose-dependent decrease in the occurrence of spontaneous epileptiform events and a reduction in their duration (the latter change occurring at doses > 20 mu M). ZD7288 also caused a dose-dependent decrease of background postsynaptic potentials. Finally, ZD7288 could depress epileptiform activity during Cs+ pretreatment, a procedure known to block Ih. These data indicate that ZD7288 hampers neocortical epileptiform synchronization, but also suggest that most of this action reflects the ability of ZD7288 to decrease synaptic transmission.

The goal was to identify prognostic factors for an early severe course in a cohort of patients with childhood-onset multiple sclerosis, for the construction of a predictive tool. METHODS. The cohort consisted of 197 children from the French Kid Sclerose en Plaques neuropediatric cohort with relapsing/ remitting multiple sclerosis beginning before the age of 16 years. Patients were included from 1990 to 2003. We used multivariate survival analysis (Cox model) to evaluate the prognostic value of clinical, MRI, and biological covariates at onset for the occurrence of a third attack or severe disability ("severity" outcome). RESULTS. The cohort was monitored for a mean of 5.5 +/- 3.6 years. The "severity" outcome was recorded for 144 patients (73%). The risk of severity was higher for girls, for a time between the first and second attacks of < 1 year, for childhood-onset multiple sclerosis MRI criteria at onset, for an absence of severe mental state changes at onset, and for a progressive course. A derived childhood-onset multiple sclerosis potential index for early severity was found to have a positive predictive value for severity of > 35% for the upper 2 quartiles. CONCLUSIONS. The clinical and MRI prognostic factors for early severity that were identified were used as the basis of a predictive tool, which will be validated in another cohort. This tool should make it possible to identify subgroups at risk of early severe disease and should facilitate therapeutic studies.

Influenza is a common childhood infection that may result in hospitalization. Our objectives were to (1) determine characteristics of children hospitalized for influenza and disease manifestations and (2) obtain baseline data before implementation of new recommendations for routine immunization of young children and their caretakers against influenza. METHODS. All of the children hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed influenza at 9 Canadian tertiary care hospitals during the 2003-2004 influenza season were identified from virology laboratory reports, and their charts were reviewed. RESULTS. There were 505 children admitted because of influenza. Fifty-seven percent were < 2 years old. Previously healthy children accounted for 58% of all of the cases. Pulmonary and neurologic disorders were the most common underlying chronic conditions. Fever and cough were the most frequent manifestations. Seizures occurred in 9% of cases. Serious complications included myocarditis (2), encephalopathy (6), and meningitis (1). There were 3 influenza-related deaths. Mean duration of hospitalization was 5.3 days. Twelve percent of children required ICU admission, and 6% required mechanical ventilation. Antibiotic therapy was administered in 77% of cases, and 7% received anti-influenza drugs. Information on influenza vaccination was available for 84 of 154 children identified as vaccine candidates. Twenty two had received vaccine, but only 7 children had been fully immunized > 14 days before the onset of illness. CONCLUSIONS. Healthy young children and children with chronic conditions are at risk for serious illness with influenza. Ongoing surveillance is needed to evaluate the impact of changing immunization recommendations on the burden of influenza illness in children.

The present study investigated the nociceptive effect of AVP in the nucleus raphe magnus (NRM) of the rat. Microinjection of AVP into the NRM increased pain threshold in a dose-dependent manner, while local administration of AVP-receptor antagonist-d(CH2)STyr(Et)DAVP decreased the pain threshold. Pain stimulation elevated AVP concentration in the NRM perfuse liquid. NRM pretreatment with AVP-receptor antagonist completely reversed AVP's effect on pain threshold in the NRM. The data suggest that AVP in the NRM is involved in antinociception. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Mechanism of smart baroreception in the aortic arch	PHYSICAL REVIEW E			English	Article								A mechanism is proposed by which the patch of baroreceptors along the inner curvature of the arch of the aorta can sense hemodynamic events occurring downstream from the aortic arch, in the periphery of the arterial tree. Based on a solution of equations governing the elastic movements of the aortic wall, it is shown that the pressure distribution along the patch of baroreceptors has the same functional form as the distribution of strain along the patch. The significance of these findings are discussed, particularly as they relate to the possibility of a neuromechanical basis of essential hypertension.

J	Halevi-Wise, Y				Halevi-Wise, Yael			The "double triangle" paradigm: National redemption in bi-generational love triangles from Agnon to Oz	PROOFTEXTS-A JOURNAL OF JEWISH LITERARY HISTORY			English	Article								This paper examines a dominant plot structure in Israeli fiction, where two generations mired in dysfunctional love triangles are historicized in relation to each other through a shared lover. Suggesting that this plot pattern is so Prominent in Hebrew fiction that we can approach it as a distinctive national paradigm, this study argues that the paradigm's significance has less to do with oedipalized representations of neurotic youth seeking parent substitutes than with a negotiation Of national redemption staged between two generations who vie for the interpretation and control of historical processes. Through the figure of the shared lover, second-generation characters evaluate their options in light of past expectations, tracing a nutshell history of modern Zionism from its initial rejection of messianic yearnings to an ongoing reassessment of the demands of statehood. The paradigm's capacity to encapsulate such a vital history-in-the-making explains why this specific plot structure has been so attractive to Hebrew writers during an extended period of national formation and consolidation.

Twenty-five women were treated with leuprolide acetate depot (LAD), a gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) analog that chemically suppressed ovarian function as treatment of various benign gynecologic disorders. Performance on tests of PFC and WM of the LAD-treated women was assessed at pretreatment baseline and, again, following 4 weeks of treatment and their performance was compared to that of 25 healthy, control participants matched on age, education, and general intelligence. Following 4 weeks of LAD treatment, estrogen levels decreased to the postmenopausal range whereas progesterone levels fell to the lower limit of the menstrual cycle range of values. Furthermore, the LAD-treated women also experienced a significant deterioration in mood, in health-related symptoms and in performance on two tests of WM following 4 weeks of treatment. It was determined that only the post-treatment declines in estrogen, but not those in progesterone, in mood, or in health-related symptoms were associated with the worsening of performance on the WM tests. These findings provide new evidence that estrogen is influential in the maintenance of WM processes in premenopausal women. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Method: The sample was composed of 167 psychiatric patients and 36 controls that were evaluated using the Defense Style Questionnaire 40. All subjects were evaluated through a clinical interview, and each evaluation was confirmed through the application of the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview, a structured psychiatric interview. We used ANOVA and discriminant analysis to assess differences between groups. Results: Neurotic defense mechanisms discriminated controls from all patients except those with social anxiety. Immature defense mechanisms differentiated controls from all patients, as well as distinguished depressive patients from panic disorder and obsessive disorder patients. The discriminant analysis indicated that depressive patients are characterized by projection, panic disorder patients by sublimation and obsessive-compulsive patients by acting out. Conclusions: Depressive and anxious patients differ from other individuals in their use of defense mechanisms, and each diagnosis has a particular pattern. These findings could lead to the development of specific psychotherapeutic interventions.

Neural correlates of thought disorder during listening to speech in schizophrenia	SCHIZOPHRENIA RESEARCH			English	Article						schizophrenia; thought disorder; fMRI; language; speech comprehension	WORKING-MEMORY; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; SEMANTIC NETWORK; FUNCTIONAL MRI; TEMPORAL-LOBE; ACTIVATION; LANGUAGE; DYSFUNCTION; FMRI; LATERALIZATION	Thought disorder is a fundamental symptom of schizophrenia, observable as irregularities in speech. It has been associated with functional and structural abnormalities in brain regions involved in language processing, including left temporal regions, during language production tasks. We were interested in the neural correlates of thought disorder during receptive language processing, as this function is relatively preserved despite relying on the same brain regions as expressive language. Twelve patients with schizophrenia and 11 controls listened to 30-s speech samples while undergoing fMRI scanning. Thought disorder and global symptom ratings were obtained for each patient. Thought disorder but not global symptomatology correlated positively with the BOLD response in the left posterior superior temporal lobe while listening to comprehensible speech (cluster-level corrected p=.023). The pattern of brain activity associated with thought disorder during listening to comprehensible speech differs from that seen during language generation tasks, where a reduction of the leftward laterality of language has often been observed. As receptive language is spared in thought disorder, we propose that the increase in activation reflects compensatory processing allowing for normal performance. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

This study is an analysis of press coverage of an advanced technology for brain imaging, functional magnetic resonance imaging, that has gained significant public visibility over the past ten years. Discussion of issues of scientific validity and interpretation dominated over ethical content in both the popular and specialized press. Coverage of research on higher order cognitive phenomena specifically attributed broad personal and societal meaning to neuroimages. The authors conclude that neuroscience provides an ideal model for exploring science communication and ethics in a multicultural context.

Astrocytes form "tripartite" complexes with presynaptic and postsynaptic structures and regulate synaptic transmission and plasticity. Despite our understanding of the importance of neuron-glial relationships in physiological contexts, little is known about the structural interplay between astrocytes and synapses. In the past, this has been difficult to explore because studies have been hampered by the lack of a system that preserves complex neuron-glial relationships observed in the brain. Here we present a system that can be used to characterize the intricate relationship between astrocytic processes and synaptic structures in situ using organotypic hippocampal slices, a preparation that retains the three-dimensional architecture of astrocyte-synapse interactions. Using time-lapse confocal imaging, we demonstrate that astrocytes can rapidly extend and retract fine processes to engage and disengage from motile postsynaptic dendritic spines. Surprisingly, astrocytic motility is, on average, higher than its dendritic spine counterparts and likely relies on actin-based cytoskeletal reorganization. Changes in astrocytic processes are typically coordinated with changes in spines, and astrocyte-spine interactions are stabilized at larger spines. Our results suggest that dynamic structural changes in astrocytes help control the degree of neuron-glial communication at hippocampal synapses.

Transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 is required for intrinsic osmoreception in organum vasculosum lamina terminalis neurons and for normal thirst responses to systemic hyperosmolality	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						hypothalamus; electrophysiology; thirst; osmoreceptor; TRPV; OVLT	3RD VENTRICLE LESIONS; VASOPRESSIN SECRETION; ANGIOTENSIN-II; OSMOTIC REGULATION; HYPERTONIC SALINE; ION CHANNELS; IN-VITRO; RAT; SENSITIVITY; NUCLEUS	Recent studies have indicated that members of the transient receptor potential vanilloid (TRPV) family of cation channels are required for the generation of normal osmoregulatory responses, yet the mechanism of osmosensory transduction in primary osmoreceptor neurons of the CNS remains to be defined. Indeed, despite ample evidence suggesting that the organum vasculosum lamina terminalis (OVLT) serves as the primary locus of the brain for the detection of osmotic stimuli, evidence that neurons in the OVLT are intrinsically osmosensitive has remained elusive. Here we show that murine OVLT neurons are intrinsically sensitive to increases in the osmolality of the extracellular fluid. Hypertonic conditions provoked increases in membrane cation conductance that resulted in the generation of an inward current, depolarizing osmoreceptor potentials, and enhanced action potential discharge. Moreover, we found that this osmosensory signal transduction cascade was absent in OVLT neurons from TRPV1 knock-out (TRPV1(-/-)) mice and that responses of wild type (WT) OVLT neurons could be blocked by ruthenium red, an inhibitor of TRPV channels. Finally, TRPV1(-/-) mice showed significantly attenuated water intake in response to systemic hypertonicity compared with WT controls. These findings indicate that OVLT neurons act as primary osmoreceptors and that a product of the trpv1 gene is required for osmosensory transduction.

It is not known whether activation of the rewired cortex evokes subjective experiences characteristic of that cortex or consistent with the rerouted sensory information. In a previous study, blind subjects were trained to perform visual tasks with a tongue display unit, a sensory substitution device that translates visual displays into electrotactile tongue stimulation. This cross-modal sensory stimulation activated their visual cortices. We now extend this finding by using transcranial magnetic stimulation to examine the perceptual correlates of training-induced plastic responses. We find that blind subjects proficient with the use of the tongue display unit report somatopicaily organized tactile sensations that are referred to the tongue when transcranial magnetic stimulation is applied over the occipital cortex. No such sensations were evoked in trained, blindfolded, seeing control subjects who performed the sensory substitution task equally well. These data show that the perceptual correlate of activity in a given cortical area reflects the characteristics of its novel sensory input source.

Phys. Chem. 110, 2474 (2006)] with neural network (NN) fits to obtain an effective means of building multidimensional potentials. We verify that it is possible to determine an accurate many-dimensional potential by doing low dimensional fits. The final potential is a sum of terms each of which depends on a subset of the coordinates. This form facilitates quantum dynamics calculations. We use NNs to represent HDMR component functions that minimize error mode term by mode term. This NN procedure makes it possible to construct high-order component functions which in turn enable us to determine a good potential. It is shown that the number of available potential points determines the order of the HDMR which should be used. (c) 2006 American Institute of Physics.

Inhibition of medulloblastoma cell invasion by Slit	ONCOGENE			English	Article						Slit; medulloblastoma; glioma; invasion; inhibitor	ROUNDABOUT RECEPTOR; AXON GUIDANCE; CANCER-CELLS; TUMOR; MIGRATION; CDC42; GENE; PROTEINS; GLIOMAS; GROWTH	Invasion of brain tumor cells has made primary malignant brain neoplasms among the most recalcitrant to therapeutic strategies. We tested whether the secreted protein Slit2, which guides the projection of axons and developing neurons, could modulate brain tumor cell invasion. Slit2 inhibited the invasion of medulloblastoma cells in a variety of in vitro models. The effect of Slit2 was inhibited by the Robo ectodomain. Time-lapse videomicroscopy indicated that Slit2 reduced medulloblastoma invasion rate without affecting cell direction or proliferation. Both medulloblastoma and glioma tumors express Robo1 and Slit2, but only medulloblastoma invasion is inhibited by recombinant Slit2 protein. Downregulation of activated Cdc42 may contribute to this differential response. Our findings reinforce the concept that neurodevelopmental cues such as Slit2 may provide insights into brain tumor invasion.

In Aplysia, there are two major phorbol ester-activated PKCs, Ca2+-activated PKC Apl I and Ca2+-independent PKC Apl II. Functional Apl II, but not Apl I, in sensory neurons is required for a form of short-term facilitation induced at sensorimotor synapses by the facilitatory transmitter serotonin (5-HT). Because PKCs are activated by translocating from the cytoplasm to the membrane, we used fluorescently tagged PKCs to determine the isoform and cell-type specificity of translocation in living Aplysia neurons. In Sf9 cells, low levels of diacylglycerol translocate Apl II, but not Apl I, which requires calcium for translocation at low concentrations of diacylglycerol. Accordingly, application of 5-HT to Aplysia sensory neurons in the absence of neuronal firing translocates Apl II, but not Apl I, consistent with the role of Apl II in short-term facilitation. This translocation is observed in sensory neurons, but not in motor neurons. Apl I translocates only if 5-HT is coupled to firing in the sensory neuron; firing alone is ineffective. Because combined 5-HT and firing are required for the induction of one type of intermediate-term facilitation at these synapses, we asked whether this form of synaptic plasticity involves activation of Apl I. We report here that dominant-negative Apl I, but not Apl II, blocks intermediate-term facilitation. Thus, different isoforms of PKC translocate under different conditions to mediate distinct types of synaptic plasticity: Ca2+-independent Apl II is involved in short-term facilitation, and Ca2+-dependent Apl I contributes to intermediate-term facilitation.

In the embryonic spinal cord, commissural axons pioneer a circumferential trajectory to the floor plate at the ventral midline directed by secreted proteins of the netrin family. In the embryonic chick spinal cord netrin-1 mRNA is expressed by floor plate cells and netrin-2 mRNA by neural epithelial cells. Antibodies to the two netrins reveal a gradient of netrin protein directly in the path of commissural axons. The netrin-1 gradient itself extends many cell diameters dorsal to the floor plate, the site of netrin-1 expression. A similar distribution of netrin-1 protein has been detected in embryonic rat and mouse spinal cord. The detection of a gradient of netrin-1 protein supports the operation of long-range chemotropic mechanisms in the developing nervous system.

Two types of cortical terminals have been identified in higher order nuclei, large (type II) and smaller (type I), which have been proposed to drive and modulate, respectively, the response properties of thalamic cells (Sherman and Guillery [1998] Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 95:7121-7126). The aim of this study was to assess and compare the relative contribution of driver and modulator inputs to the LP nucleus that originate from the posteromedial part of the lateral suprasylvian cortex (PMLS) and area 17. To achieve this goal, the anterograde tracers biotinylated dextran amine (BDA) or Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin (PHAL) were injected into area 17 or PMLS. Results indicate that area 17 injections preferentially labelled large terminals, whereas PMLS injections preferentially labelled small terminals. A detailed analysis of PMLS terminal morphology revealed at least four categories of terminals: small type I terminals (57%), medium-sized to large singletons (30%), large terminals in arrangements of intermediate complexity (8%), and large terminals that form arrangements resembling rosettes (5%). Ultrastructural analysis and postembedding immunocytochemical staining for gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) distinguished two types of labelled PMLS terminals: small profiles with round vesicles (RS profiles) that contacted mostly non-GABAergic dendrites outside of glomeruli and large profiles with round vesicles (RL profiles) that contacted non-GABAergic dendrites (55%) and GABAergic dendritic terminals (45%) in glomeruli. RL profiles likely include singleton, intermediate, and rosette terminals, although future studies are needed to establish definitively the relationship between light microscopic morphology and ultrastructural features. All terminals types appeared to be involved in reciprocal corticothalamocortical connections as a result of an intermingling of terminals labelled by anterograde transport and cells labelled by retrograde transport. In conclusion, our results indicate that the origin of the driver inputs reaching the LP nucleus is not restricted to the primary visual cortex and that extrastriate visual areas might also contribute to the basic organization of visual receptive fields of neurons in this higher order nucleus.

Alterations in Ret gene are related to several neoplasias: point mutations are identified in medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) and multiple endocrine neoplasias 2A and B (MEN2A and 13), while translocations and chromosomal inversions cause papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). We expressed recombinant RET kinase domain (rRET) containing the active site, the ATP binding pocket, and the activation loop with regulatory activity, with the Baculovirus expression system. RET was purified by a two-step procedure consisting of an anion exchange chromatography followed by nickel affinity chromatography. Moreover a biochemical characterization of the recombinant product was performed in order to verify its activity (by ELISA) and physical state (dynamic light scattering). We used rRET to validate an ELISA-based kinase assay, by testing inhibitors reported in literature such as PP1 and PP2. This method represents an easy system to screen potential inhibitors found by computational methods. We also produced V804M mutants to identify inhibitors that can overcome resistance to PP1 and ZD6474. The catalytic domain of RET can be used also for X-ray diffraction to obtain information about the three-dimensional structure, necessary for a rational design of selective inhibitors: it represents an important tool to understand the molecular mechanisms causing thyroid cancer and to care it.

Characterization of the inflammatory infiltrates in the nervous tissue revealed a predominance of CD8(+) T cells, suggesting a prominent role of this T cell subset in the pathology. In this study, we show that the same neurological disease occurred in Tg mice deficient in the generation of CD4(+) T cells, with an earlier time of onset. Analysis of the CD8(+) T cell repertoire at early stage of disease revealed the presence of selected clonal expansions in the CNS but not in peripheral lympboid organs. We further show that Tg animals deficient in IFN-gamma receptor expression were completely resistant to disease development. Microglia activation that is an early event in disease development is IFN-gamma dependent and thus appears as a key element in disease pathogenesis. Collectively, our data indicate that the spontaneous demyelinating disease in this animal model occurs as a consequence of an inflammatory response initiated through the activation of CNS-specific CD8(+) T cells by Tg expression of B7.2 within the target organ. Thus, autoreactive CD8(+) T cells can contribute directly to the pathogenesis of neuroinflammatory diseases such as multiple sclerosis.

Mechanisms underlying long-term changes at interneurone excitatory synapses, despite their importance, remain largely unknown. We use two-photon calcium imaging and whole-cell recordings to determine the Ca2+ signalling mechanisms linked specifically to group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR1 alpha and mGluR5) and their role in hebbian long-term potentiation (LTP) in oriens/alveus (O/A) interneurones. We demonstrate that mGluR1 alpha activation elicits dendritic Ca2+ signals resulting from Ca2+ influx via transient receptor potential (TRP) channels and Ca2+ release from intracellular stores. By contrast, mGluR5 activation produces dendritic Ca2+ transients mediated exclusively by intracellular Ca2+ release. Using Western blot analysis and immunocytochemistry, we show mGluR1 alpha-specific extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2) activation via Src in CA1 hippocampus and, in particular, in O/A interneurones. Moreover, we find that mGluR1 alpha/TRP Ca2+ signals in interneurone dendrites are dependent on activation of the Src/ERK cascade. Finally, this mGluR1 alpha-specific Ca2+ signalling controls LTP at interneurone synapses since blocking either TRP channels or Src/ERK and intracellular Ca2+ release prevents LTP induction. Thus, our findings uncover a novel molecular mechanism of interneurone-specific Ca2+ signalling, critical in regulating synaptic excitability in hippocampal networks.

We previously reported that Cdc42 facilitates exocytosis in neuroendocrine cells by stimulating actin assembly at docking sites for secretory granules. These findings raise the question of the mechanism activating Cdc42 in exocytosis. The neuronal guanine nucleotide exchange factor, intersectin-1L, which specifically activates Cdc42 and is at an interface between membrane trafficking and actin dynamics, appears as an ideal candidate to fulfill this function. Using PC12 and chromaffin cells, we now show the presence of intersectin-1 at exocytotic sites. Moreover, through an RNA interference strategy coupled with expression of various constructs encoding the guanine nucleotide exchange domain, we demonstrate that intersectin-1L is an essential component of the exocytotic machinery. Silencing of intersectin-1 prevents secretagogue-induced activation of Cdc42 revealing intersectin-1L as the factor integrating Cdc42 activation to the exocytotic pathway. Our results extend the current role of intersectin-1L in endocytosis to a function in exocytosis and support the idea that intersectin-1L is an adaptor that coordinates exo-endocytotic membrane trafficking in secretory cells.

We show that daily administration (days 8 to 24) of murine ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), a neurotrophic factor that has been described as a survival and differentiation factor for neurons and oligodendrocytes, significantly ameliorates the clinical course of a mouse model of multiple sclerosis. in the acute phase of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis induced by myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein peptide 35-55, treatment with CNTF did not change the peripheral immune response but did reduce the number of perivascular infiltrates and T cells and the level of diffuse microglial activation in spinal cord. Blood brain barrier permeability was significantly reduced in CNTF-treated animals. Beneficial effects of CNTF did not persist after it was withdrawn. After cessation of CNTF treatment, inflammation and symptoms returned to control levels. However, slight but significantly higher numbers of oligodendrocytes, NG2-positive cells, axons, and neurons were observed in mice that had been treated with high concentrations of CNTF. Our results show that CNTF inhibits inflammation in the spinal cord, resulting in amelioration of the clinical course of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis during time of treatment.

Pexelizumab reduces death and myocardial infarction in higher risk cardiac surgical patients	ANNALS OF THORACIC SURGERY			English	Article							BYPASS GRAFT-SURGERY; CARDIOPULMONARY BYPASS; MORTALITY; ANTIBODY; OUTCOMES; REVASCULARIZATION; DETERMINANTS; ACTIVATION; COMMITTEE; BLOCKADE	Background. Morbidity and mortality after coronary artery bypass graft surgery are directly related to specific preoperative risk factors. We assessed the influence of preoperative risk factors on the effect of pexelizumab, a C5 complement inhibitor, to reduce postoperative morbidity and mortality in this post hoc analysis of the Pexelizumab for Reduction in Myocardial Infarction and MOrtality in Coronary Artery Bypass Graft surgery (PRIMO-CABG) trial, a phase III double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 3,099 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass. Methods. The composite endpoint of death or myocardial infarction or both through postoperative day 30 was examined in subpopulations of patients with pre-specified risk factors, which included diabetes mellitus, prior coronary artery bypass graft, urgent intervention, female sex, history of neurologic event, history of congestive heart failure, and two or more previous myocardial infarctions or a recent myocardial infarction. Stratified post hoc analyses were also performed on patients presenting with two or more and three or more of those risk factors. Results. Pexelizumab significantly reduced the incidence of the composite endpoint of death or myocardial infarction through postoperative day 30 by 28% in patients with two or more risk factors (p = 0.004) and 44% in patients with three or more risk factors (p < 0.001). Conclusions. The C5 complement inhibitor, pexelizumab, reduced morbidity and mortality among high-risk patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting with cardiopulmonary bypass.

Delivery of rewarding medial forebrain bundle stimulation at a low rate (5 trains/min) produced a sustained elevation of dopamine levels, regardless of whether train onset was predictable. When the rate of train delivery was increased to 40 trains/min, dopamine levels rose rapidly during the first 40 min but then declined toward the baseline range. The rewarding impact of the stimulation was reduced following prior delivery of stimulation at the high, but not the low, rate. These results support the idea that dopamine tone plays an enabling role in brain stimulation reward and is elevated similarly by predictable and unpredictable stimulation.

Neurotrophins and their receptors have been validated for pathologies including neurodegenerative disorders of the central nervous system and the peripheral nervous system, certain types of cancers, asthma, inflammation and others. Development of neurotrophin-based therapeutics is important due to the limitations of using whole neurotrophins as pharmacological agents. The use of mimicry has proven to be an alternative. Mimetics can be developed through a number of different approaches. To develop receptor-binding agents, we have used anti-receptor antibody mimicry and neurotrophin mimicry. To develop ligand-binding agents, we have used antiligand antibody mimicry and receptor mimicry. High-throughput screening can be incorporated to complement any of these approaches. The end result is small molecule peptidomimetics with properties favourable over proteins. The present review will offer a general overview of these strategies with a few proven examples from our laboratory.

Both coccinellid and chrysopid diet resulted in lower mortality and increased longevity of H. vitripennis, but daily fecundity was greater with the former. The phagostimulant b- sistosterol had the greatest impact on H. vitripennis mortality (lowest) and nymphal weight gain (highest) when added to the coccinellid diet. These results demonstrate that H. vitripennis could be reared on an artificial diet, and suggests that b- sistosterol has phagostimulant properties for this predator.

Exposure to 5-bromo-2 '-deoxyuridine induces oxidative stress and activator protein-1 DNA binding activity in the embryo	BIRTH DEFECTS RESEARCH PART A-CLINICAL AND MOLECULAR TERATOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	45th Annual Meeting of the Japanese-Teratology-Society	JUL 14-16, 2005	Tokyo, JAPAN	Japanese Teratol Soc		glutathione; redox homeostasis; organogenesis; c-Jun; c-Fos; teratogen	NEURAL-TUBE DEFECTS; LACKING C-FOS; N-ACETYLCYSTEINE; MOUSE EMBRYOS; CELL-DEATH; GENE-EXPRESSION; RAT CONCEPTUS; IN-VITRO; NEURONAL DIFFERENTIATION; DEVELOPMENTAL TOXICITY	BACKGROUND: During organogenesis the embryo is highly sensitive to oxidative stress. We hypothesize that oxidative stress and activation of a redox-sensitive transcription factor, activator protein-1 (AP-1), are early indicators of embryonic stress in response to a teratogenic insult. 5-Bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) was chosen as a model teratogen to test this hypothesis; BrdU is a thymidine analog that is incorporated into replicating DNA. METHODS: Timed pregnant CD1 mice were given vehicle or BrdU (400, 600, 800, or 1000 mg of BrdU/kg of body weight) on gestation day 9 (GD 9). Oxidative stress, assessed as the ratio of glutathione disulfide (GSSG) to reduced glutathione (GSH), and AP-1 DNA binding activity (c-Fos- and c-jun-dependent DNA binding) were measured in the maternal livers and embryos 0.5, 3, and 6 hr after treatment. External and skeletal malformations were assessed on GD 18. N-acetylcysteine, a glutathione precursor, was coadministered with BrdU to further explore the relationship between teratogenicity and redox homeostasis. RESULTS: BrdU exposure produced a dose-dependent increase in skeletal malformations, which included polydactyly, and delayed ossification of the sternebrae and vertebrae. Exposure to teratogenic doses of BrdU depleted GSH concentrations and increased oxidative stress, as assessed by the GSSG.:GSH ratio, in both maternal livers and embryos. While c-Jun DNA binding activity in embryos Was not affected, c-Fos DNA binding activity was elevated significantly 3 hr after BrdU exposure. Coadministration. of N-acetylcysteine decreased the skeletal malformations and AP-1 DNA binding activity induced by BrdU. CONCLUSIONS: BrdU exposure induced an embryonic stress response manifested as an increase in oxidative stress and AP-1 DNA binding activity; these data support the hypothesis that disturbances in redox homeostasis mediate the response of the conceptus to a teratogenic insult.

Sources: Bibliographic literature search and personal files. Findings: In Canada, 16-20% of critically ill adults die in the ICU. Many of these deaths follow acute brain injury in the setting of clinical deterioration, life support limitation and brain death. This brief review addresses some key elements of end of life care for critically ill brain injured patients, including family interactions, making survival predictions, and factors influencing decision-making about cardiopulmonary resuscitation and withdrawal of mechanical ventilation. Conclusions: Provision of compassionate high quality end of life care should be standard of practice for brain injured and all other critically ill patients who cannot survive. Inconsistencies in end of life care may affect where, when and how patients die, the quality of their death and whether or not they are considered for organ and tissue donation.

Parallel with this has been a change in the demographics of organ donors with an increase in older donors and donors with marginal organs as a proportion of the total organ donor pool. Consequently, efforts have been made to improve the medical care delivered to potential organ donors to improve the conversion rate and graft survival of available organs. The purpose of this literature review is to provide updated recommendations for the contemporary management of organ donors after the neurological determination of death in order to maximize the probability of recipient graft survival. Sources: A comprehensive review of the literature obtained through searches of MEDLINE/PubMed, and personal reference files. Principal findings: Contemporary management of the organ donor after neurological determination of death includes therapies to prevent the detrimental effects of the autonomic storm, the use of invasive hemodynamic monitoring and aggressive respiratory therapy including therapeutic bronchoscopy in marginal heart and lung donors, and the use of hormonal therapy including vasopressin, corticosteroids, triiodothyronine or thyroxine, and insulin for the pituitary failure and inflammation seen in brain dead organ donors. The importance of normalizing donor physiology to optimize all available organs is stressed. Conclusion: Aggressive hemodynamic and respiratory management of solid organ donors, coupled with the use of hormonal therapy improves the rate of conversion and graft survival in solid organ recipients.

Nevertheless, the morbidity and mortality rates remain high in this population. In addition to pharmacological therapies to attenuate neurohumoral overactivation, the present challenge is to find additional therapeutic avenues. Percutaneous coronary intervention, although widely used in patients with coronary artery disease, is more challenging with multivessel disease and associated left ventricular dysfunction, and its optimal use in heart failure remains in question. Cardiac surgical revascularization and surgical ventricular restoration have also been advocated. To date, there are no prospective, randomized clinical studies to prove a benefit from these invasive interventions and to identify which patients may derive the most benefit compared with optimal medical therapy alone. The current management of patients with ischemic heart failure needs to be challenged and requires an objective evaluation of these invasive interventions. The ongoing Surgical Treatment for Ischemic Heart Failure (STICH) trial is the first randomized trial designed to determine the long-term benefits of surgical revascularization and surgical ventricular restoration compared with optimal medical therapy alone. The results of this study will provide additional evidence-based information to guide physicians in the rational allocation of health care resources. The role of percutaneous angioplasty in patients with ischemic heart failure also needs to be addressed objectively.

This paper is the companion piece to the French-language one also published in this issue of the Canadian Journal of Neurological Sciences. It serves as a review of recent advances in neuroethics through the lens of three cases: (1) incidental finding of anomalies in neuroimaging research; (2) creation of neurotechnologies that can lead to cognitive enhancement, and (3) responsible communication of research results. We propose and discuss a multidimensional framework of neuroethical responsibilities to help tackle these issues. The framework reiterates the fundamental role of scientific integrity, puts in the foreground social responsibilities pertaining to the eventual use of neuroscience knowledge, and highlights self-reflection in research and training of researchers.

Some populations, such as aboriginal peoples, are particularly at risk for this disease. In the Cree Nation of Quebec, Canada, prevalence in adults is approaching 20%, and the consequences are compounded by low compliance with modern medicine. In 2003, we conducted an ethnobotanical study of Cree medicinal plants used for the treatment of symptoms of diabetes. This served as the basis for a project designed to identify efficacious complementary treatment options more readily accepted by this population. The present study assesses the in vitro anti-diabetic potential of extracts from the 8 most promising plants to emerge from the ethnobotanical study. Cell-based bioassays were employed to screen for (i) potentiation of glucose uptake by skeletal muscle cells (C2C12) and adipocytes (3T3-L1); (ii) potentiation of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) and insulin production by pancreatic beta cells (INS 832/13); (iii) potentiation of triglyceride accumulation in differentiating 3T3-L1 cells; (iv) protection against glucose toxicity and glucose deprivation in pre-sympathetic neurons (PC12-AC). Additionally, anti-oxidant activity was measured biochemically by the diphenylpicrylhydrazyl (DPPH) reduction assay. All plant extracts potentiated basal or insulin-stimulated glucose uptake to some degree in muscle cells or adipocytes. Adipocyte differentiation was accelerated by 4 extracts.

J	Lafortune, D; Collin, J				Lafortune, Denis; Collin, Johanne			Prescription of psychoactive drugs to adults and children: prevalence, policy, practice and track of the study.	CANADIAN PSYCHOLOGY-PSYCHOLOGIE CANADIENNE			French	Review							AGGRESSIVE YOUTH TRAAY; CONFLICTS-OF-INTEREST; PSYCHOTROPIC MEDICATION; PHARMACEUTICAL-INDUSTRY; TREATMENT RECOMMENDATIONS; PSYCHIATRIC PRACTICE; MENTAL-HEALTH; PHARMACOTHERAPY; DISORDER; CARE	This literature review focuses on the use of psychotropic medication among youths. In a global context where psychiatry, genetics and neurosciences are booming, it is imperative to re-examine the policies, guidelines and clinical settings that determine the prescription of psychotropic medication to children and adolescents. The relevant issues are first discussed from an epidemiological standpoint. Official documents exposing the major principles put forth by Quebec ministries are then reviewed. Subsequently, the cautions regarding medication and the calls for multimodal/multidisciplinary interventions that characterize these official documents are compared to the incessant growth in the rates of prescription and polyprescription. In order to shed some light on this discrepancy, we refer to the "medication optimal usage" paradigm. To define a larger problem relating to the use of psychotropic medication, three elements are considered: a) the ambiguity of diagnostic markers; b) the tendency to dissociate the pharmacoprescription from the diagnosis of a mental disorder; and c) the growing complexity associated with multimodal treatments. There is also a possible discrepancy between the government's current views, and the significant breakthroughs of the neurosciences in psychiatry and in other areas.

Yet in everyday life, hand actions are also modulated by our affective state, revealing it, in turn, to the observer. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to identify brain regions engaged during the observation of hand actions performed either in a neutral or an angry way. We also asked whether these are the same regions as those involved in perceiving expressive faces. During the passive observation of emotionally neutral hand movements, the fMRI signal increased significantly in dorsal and ventral premotor cortices, with the exact location of the 'peaks' distinct from those induced by face observation. Various areas in the extrastriate visual cortex were also engaged, overlapping with the face-related activity. When the observed hand action was performed with emotion, additional regions were recruited including the right dorsal premotor, the right medial prefrontal cortex, the left anterior insula and a region in the rostral part of the supramarginal gyrus bilaterally. These regions, except for the supramarginal gyrus, were also activated during the perception of angry faces. These results complement the wealth of studies on the perception of affect from faces and provide further insights into the processes involved in the perception of others underlying, perhaps, social constructs such as empathy.

To assess the impact of RHD on the processing of non-literal language, ten participants presenting with RHD and ten matched healthy control participants were administered tasks tapping humour appreciation and pragmatic interpretation of non-literal language. Although the RHD participants exhibited a relatively intact ability to interpret humour from jokes, their use of pragmatic knowledge about interpersonal relationships in discourse was significantly reduced, leading to abnormalities in their understanding of communicative intentions (CI). Results imply that explicitly detailing CI in discourse facilitates RHD participants' comprehension of nonliteral language.

Cross-modal interactions in the perception of musical performance	COGNITION			English	Article						cross-modal interactions; music cognition; emotion; gesture	EMOTION; TENSION; BRAIN; RECOGNITION; TIME; EXPRESSION; PHYSIOLOGY; JUDGMENTS; MOVEMENT; LANGUAGE	We investigate the dynamics of sensory integration for perceiving musical performance, a complex natural behavior. Thirty musically trained participants saw, heard, or both saw and heard, performances by two clarinetists. All participants used a sliding potentiometer to make continuous judgments of tension (a measure correlated with emotional response) and continuous judgments of phrasing (a measure correlated with perceived musical structure) as performances were presented. The data analysis sought to reveal relations between the sensory modalities (vision and audition) and to quantify the effect of seeing the performances on participants' overall subjective experience of the music. In addition to traditional statistics, functional data analysis techniques were employed to analyze time-varying aspects of the data. The auditory and visual channels were found to convey similar experiences of phrasing but different experiences of tension through much of the performances. We found that visual information served both to augment and to reduce the experience of tension at different points in the musical piece (as revealed by functional linear modeling and functional significance testing). In addition, the musicians' movements served to extend the sense of phrasing, to cue the beginning of new phrases, to indicate musical interpretation, and to anticipate changes in emotional content. Evidence for an interaction effect suggests that there may exist an emergent quality when musical performances are both seen and heard. The investigation augments knowledge of human communicative processes spanning language and music, and involving multiple modalities of emotion and information transfer. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

En1 is a homeobox transcription factor gene expressed in the central dermomyotome. We show by genetic fate nnapping in the mouse that En1-expressing cells of the central dermomyotome give rise to dorsal dermis and epaxial muscle and, unexpectedly, to interscapular brown fat. Thus, the En1-expressing central dermomyotome normally gives rise to three distinct fates in mice. Win signals are important in early stages of dermomyotome development, but the signal that acts to specify the dermal fate has not been identified. Using a reporter transgene for Win signal transduction, we show that the En1-expressing cells directly underneath the surface ectoderm transduce Wnt signals. When the essential Wnt transducer beta-catenin is mutated in En1 cells, it results in the loss of Dermo1-expressing dorsal dermal progenitors and dermis. Conversely, when beta-catenin was activated in En1 cells, it induces Dermo1-expression in all cells of the En1 domain and disrupts muscle gene expression. Our results indicate that the mouse central dermomyotome gives rise to dermis, muscle, and brown fat, and that Writ signalling normally instructs cells to select the dorsal dermal fate.

However, whether deficits in genes encoding G protein-coupled receptors may down-regulate the activity of 5-HT neurons is unknown currently. Based on recent evidence that stress-induced anorexia may involve 5-HT(4)receptors (5-HT4R), we measured various aspects of 5-HT function in 5-HT4R knock-out (KO) mice. When compared to dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) 5-HT neurons from wild-type mice, those from 5-HT4R KO mice exhibited reduced spontaneous electrical activity. This reduced activity was associated with diminished tissue levels of 5-HT and its main metabolite, 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid (5-HIAA). Cumulative, systemic doses of the 5-HT uptake blocker citalopram, that reduced 5-HT cell firing by 30% in wild-type animals, completely inhibited 5-HT neuron firing in the KO mice. This effect was reversed by administration of the 5-HT1A receptor (5-HT1AR) antagonist, WAY100635, in mice of both genotypes. Other changes in DRN of the KO mice included increases in the levels of 5-HT plasma membrane transporter sites and mRNA, as well as a decrease in the density of 5-HT1AR sites without any change in 5-HT1A mRNA content. With the exception of increased 5-HT turnover index in the hypothalamus and nucleus accumbens and a decreased density of 5-HT1AR sites in the dorsal hippocampus (CA1) and septum, no major changes were detected in 5-HT territories of projection, suggesting region-specific adaptive changes. The mechanisms whereby 5-HT4R mediate a tonic positive influence on the firing activity of DRN 5-HT neurons and 5-HT content remain to be determined.

Methods: We described different aspects of this field, after dividing it into conceptually distinct strata. Results: Outcomes research can be divided into macro, meso and micro levels. Each level is further subdivided. Macro-level research targets cost and health care utilization, as well as racial, ethnic and geopolitical population health determinants. Meso-level studies address effectiveness, variability, disease impact, clinical modeling and program evaluation studies. Finally, micro-level studies address all aspects of direct patient-clinician decision-making. Conclusions: An explosion of outcomes research has occurred in the past decades. Wide access to information technology, data sharing and collaborative efforts between researchers represent some of the ingredients that did and will continue to fuel that growth.

In this review, the authors demonstrate the upregulation of COX-2/prostaglandin E-2, IL-6 and calcitonin gene-related peptide in invading macrophages and discuss possible mechanisms involved in their upregulation and how they contribute to the maintenance of neuropathic pain. By acting on nociceptors in dorsal root ganglion and local inflammatory cells via autocrine or paracrine pathways, these inflammatory mediators facilitate spontaneous ectopic activity and sustain nociceptive responses, an important mechanism underlying both ongoing and evoked neuropathic pain state. Targeting these mediators in injured nerve may provide novel therapeutic avenues to more successfully treat nerve injury-associated neuropathic pain.

Much remains to be learned about the pathways involved in the severe hematopoietic phenotype observed in Bmi1 homozygous mutant mice except for the fact that loss of p53 or concomitant loss of p16(Ink4a) and p19(Arf) functions achieves only a partial rescue. Here we report the identification of E4F1, an inhibitor of cellular proliferation, as a novel BMI1-interacting partner in hematopoietic cells. We provide evidence that Bmi1 and B4f1 genetically interact in the hematopoietic compartment to regulate cellular proliferation. Most importantly, we demonstrate that reduction of E4f1 levels through RNA interference mediated knockdown is sufficient to rescue the clonogenic and repopulating ability of Bmi1(-/-) hematopoietic cells up to 3 mo post-transplantation. Using cell lines and MEF, we also demonstrate that INK4A/ARF and p53 are not essential for functional interaction between Bmi1 and E4f1. Together, these findings identify E4F1 as a key modulator of BMI1 activity in primitive hematopoietic cells.

The TgCRND8 mouse, transgenic for the human amyloid precursor protein, is an aggressive early onset model of brain amyloid deposition. Preliminary studies revealed that when the transgene is expressed on an AM genetic background, these mice not only survive longer but also deposit less parenchymal amyloid-beta (A beta) peptides as compared to those on a C57BL/6 background. We performed a genome-wide study of an F2 intercross between TgCRND8 on an AM background and C57BL/6 mice, to identify genetic modulators of amyloid accumulation and deposition. We identified four highly significant QTLs that together account for 55% of the phenotypic variance in the number of plaques (Thioflavin S). QTLs were found on the distal part of chromosome 4 with an LOD score of 8.1 at D4MR251, on chromosome 11 with an LOD score of 5.5 at D11MU242, on chromosome 9 with an LOD score of 5.0 at D9Mit336 and on the proximal part of chromosome 8 with an LOD score of 4.5 at DMK223. AM alleles at these loci are protective and all decreased the amount of AP deposition. Interestingly, the QTL on chromosome 11 is also significantly linked to the levels of brain A beta(42) and A beta(40). Although these QTLs do not control the levels of plasmatic A beta, other regions on chromosomes 1 and 6 show significant linkage. Further characterization of these QTL regions may lead to the identification of genes involved in the pathogenesis of AD.

Stable identification of nonlinear systems using neural networks: Theory and experiments	IEEE-ASME TRANSACTIONS ON MECHATRONICS			English	Article						macro-micro manipulators (M(3)); neural networks; nonlinear identification; nonlinear system		This paper presents an approach for stable identification of multivariable nonlinear system dynamics using a multilayer feedforward neural network. Unlike most of the previous neural network identifiers, the proposed identifier is based on a nonlinearin-parameters neural network (NLPNN). Therefore, it is applicable to systems with higher degrees of nonlinearities. Both parallel and series-parallel models are used with no a priori knowledge about the system dynamics. The method can be considered both as an online identifier that can be used as a basis for designing a neural network controller as well, as an offline learning scheme for monitoring the system states. A novel approach is proposed for the weight updating mechanism based on the modification of the backpropagation (BP) algorithm. The stability of the overall system is shown using Lyapunov's direct method. To demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithm, an experimental setup consisting of a three-link macro-micro manipulator (M(3)) is considered. The proposed approach is applied to identify the dynamics of the experimental robot. Experimental and simulation results are given to show the effectiveness of the proposed learning scheme.

Acute infection caused by intravenous injection of C. albicans blastospores is associated with rapid fungal replication in the heart, brain, and, in particular, kidneys of C5-deficient mice. Histological studies and analysis of markers for tissue damage indicated that the heart is the organ that is most affected and that it ultimately fails in C5-deficient mice. In A/J and BcA17 mice, tissue damage is associated with (i) cellular infiltration in the heart, which is not seen in the kidney despite the higher fungal load in the latter organ, and (ii) a very strong inflammatory response, including elevated levels of many cytokines and chemokines. This results in cardiomyopathy, which is associated with elevated levels of creatine kinase and cardiac troponin I in the circulation. Damage to the cardiac muscle is associated with metabolic changes, including hypoglycemia, decreased lipid utilization resulting in elevated levels of cardiac triglycerides, and unproductive glucose utilization linked to a dramatic increase in the level of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (Pdk4), a negative regulator of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex.

The objective of our study was to perform a cost-minimization analysis of a wide-area teleradiology network. Design. A prospective analysis of all transmissions over 1 year (data transmitted at the time of the remote consultation, and health outcomes of patients from medical record). Intervention. The inter-hospital teleradiology network of the Aquitaine area (RIHRA) is a telemedicine system enabling the management of remote emergencies and elective radiology consultations. Main outcome measure. A cost-minimization study enabled a comparison of care procedures following the use of the network with those which would have been implemented without the network. The outcome measures of effectiveness were the transfers, hospitalizations, and consultations avoided or added. Fixed and variable costs were estimated. Results. Among the 664 transmissions included in the study, 562 (85%) were performed in emergency and 102 (15%) for elective (non-emergency) cases. In emergency, 48% of transfers were avoided. For elective teleconsultations, a transfer was avoided for 37% of the patients and hospitalization for 12%. An extra consultation occurred after remote consultation for 2% of the patients. Annual saving can be estimated at 102 779 EUR for the Aquitaine area. Conclusions. This study underlines the efficiency of an inter-hospital teleradiology network. A qualitative evaluation of the impact of the use of the system should be carried out to improve technical and organizational operations.

The role of microglia, present in the retina early in development before vascularization, remains ill defined. The authors investigated whether microglia are implicated in retinal blood vessel formation. METHODS. The microglia and vasculature of developing human fetal and rodent retinas were examined by labeling the endothelial cells with lectin and the microglia with CD18 antibody or green fluorescent protein driven by the promoter of the chemokine receptor CX(3)CR1. Rodent ischemic proliferative retinopathy induced by hyperoxia or hypercapnia, which model retinopathy of prematurity, and ex vivo retinal explants were used to assess microglial involvement in vascular pathology. Microglial participation in developmental retinal vessel formation was further studied in neonatal rats after pharmacologic macrophage depletion with the use of clodronate liposomes and subsequent intravitreal injection of microglia. RESULTS. Microglia intimately appose developing vessels of human and murine retinas. Ischemic retinopathy models exhibit decreased microglia concomitant with the characteristic reductions in vasculature observed in these retinopathies. Retinal explants exposed to conditions resulting in ischemic retinopathies ( in vivo) reveal that antioxidants protect against microglial loss. Depletion of resident retinal microglia, but not systemic macrophages, reduced developmental vessel growth and density, which were restored by intravitreal microglial injection. CONCLUSIONS. These observations suggest that proper retinal blood vessel formation requires an adequate resident microglial population because diminished microglia are associated with decreased vascularity in models of ischemic retinopathy and retinal vascular development. In light of these findings, the traditional definition of microglia as merely immunocompetent cells should be reconsidered to encompass this new function related to blood vessel formation.

J Appl Physiol 101: 413-419, 2006. First published April 27, 2006; doi: 10.1152/japplphysiol.01346.2005. - To quantify the concurrent transduction capabilities of spatially distributed intrinsic cardiac neurons, the activities generated by atrial vs. ventricular intrinsic cardiac neurons were recorded simultaneously in 12 anesthetized dogs at baseline and during alterations in the cardiac milieu. Few (3%) identified atrial and ventricular neurons (2 of 72 characterized neurons) responded solely to regional mechanical deformation, doing so in a tightly coupled fashion (cross-correlation coefficient r = 0.63). The remaining (97%) atrial and ventricular neurons transduced multimodal stimuli to display stochastic behavior. Specifically, ventricular chemosensory inputs modified these populations such that they generated no short-term coherence among their activities (cross-correlation coefficient r = 0.21 +/- 0.07). Regional ventricular ischemia activated most atrial and ventricular neurons in a noncoupled fashion. Nicotinic activation of atrial neurons enhanced ventricular neuronal activity. Acute decentralization of the intrinsic cardiac nervous system obtunded its neuron responsiveness to cardiac sensory stimuli. Most atrial and ventricular intrinsic cardiac neurons generate concurrent stochastic activity that is predicated primarily upon their cardiac chemotransduction. As a consequence, they display relative independent short-term (beat-to-beat) control over regional cardiac indexes. Over longer time scales, their functional interdependence is manifest as the result of interganglionic interconnections and descending inputs.

Role of MSK1 in the signaling pathway leading to VEGF-Mediated PAF synthesis in endothelial cells	JOURNAL OF CELLULAR BIOCHEMISTRY			English	Article						MSK1; VEGF; PAF; sPLA(2)-V; inflammation; angiogenesis	PLATELET-ACTIVATING-FACTOR; GROWTH-FACTOR; PROTEIN-KINASE; VASCULAR-PERMEABILITY; HUMAN NEUTROPHILS; REGULATED KINASE; BINDING PROTEIN; MAP KINASE; PHOSPHORYLATION; CREB	Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inflammatory effects require acute platelet-activating factor (PAF) synthesis by endothelial cells (EC). We previously reported that VEGF-mediated PAF synthesis involves the activation of VEGF receptor-2/Neuropilin-1 complex, which is leading to the activation of p38 and p42/44 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and group V secretory phospholipase A(2) (sPLA(2)-V). As the mechanisms regulating sPLA(2)-V remain unknown, we addressed the role of the mitogen- and stress-activated protein kinase-1 (MSK1), which can be rapidly and transiently activated by p38 or p42/44 MAPKs. In native bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC), we observed a constitutive protein interaction of MSK1 with p38, p42/44 MAPKs, and sPLA2-V. These protein interactions were maintained in BAEC transfected either with the empty vector pCDNA3.1, wild-type MSK1 (MSK1-WT)or N-terminal dead kinase MSK1 mutant (MSK1-D195A). However, in BAEC expressing C-terminal dead kinase MSK1 mutant (MSK1 D565A), the interaction between MSK1 and sPLA2-V was reduced by 82% and 90% under basal and VEGF-treated conditions as compared to native BAEC. Treatment with VEGF for 15 min increased basal PAF synthesis in native BAEC, pCDNA3.1, MSK1-WT, and MSK1-D195A by 166%, 139%, 125%, and 82%, respectively. In contrast, PAF synthesis was prevented in cells expressing MSK1-D565A mutant. These results demonstrate the essential role of the C-terminal domain of MSK1 for its constitutive interaction with sPLA2-V, which appears essential to support VEGF-mediated PAF synthesis.

Differential diagnosis of local painful swelling of the retropharyngeal area includes retropharyngeal lymph node infection, neoplasm, cellulitis, hematoma, guttural pouch empyema, parotiditis, and jugular thrombosis. Apart from Streptococcus equi ssp. equi, other bacteria are rarely reported as a cause of retropharyngeal abscesses. The reason for this might be a lack of specific sampling to identify the causative agent. This work deals with a case of retropharyngeal infection in an 11-year-old Standardbred stallion with acute depression, fever, tachycardia, asymmetric painful swelling in the throat area, ptyalism, and respiratory distress. Endoscopy, radiography, ultrasonography, blood analysis, and cytological examination of a puncture sample taken from the throat mass were consistent with a pyogenic to pyogranulomatous retropharyngeal inflammation. The clinical evolution was initially satisfactory in response to treatment with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs and antibiotics, but clinical signs relapsed twice, each time a few weeks after cessation of antibiotic therapy. The bacteriologic finding in this case was unusual and consisted of the isolation of a Pasteurella multocida strain that was obtained after the second relapse (ie, 79 days after initial admission), using a brain heart infusion (BHI) medium, and after two successive negative bacteriological cultures performed on day one of clinical signs and at the first relapse of clinical signs, respectively.

Often, patients with a similar clinical presentation do not carry expansions of the CAG repeat in this gene [Huntington disease-like (HDL) patients]. We report the genetic analysis of 107 Portuguese patients with an HDL phenotype. The HDL genes PRNP and JPH3, encoding the prion protein and junctophilin-3, respectively, were screened for repeat expansions in these patients. Given the partial clinical overlap of SCA17, DRPLA and neuroferritinopathy with HD, their causative genes (TBP, ATN1, and FTL, respectively) were also analysed. Finally, repeat expansions in two candidate genes, CREBBP and POU3F2, which encode the nuclear transcriptional coactivator CREB-binding protein and the CNS-specific transcription factor N-Oct-3, respectively, were also studied. Expansions of the repetitive tracts of the PRNP, JPH3, TBP, ATN1, CREBBP and POU3F2 genes were excluded in all patients, as were sequence alterations in the FTL gene. Since none of the genes already included in the differential diagnosis of HD was responsible for the disease in our sample, the genetic heterogeneity of the HDL phenotype is still open for investigation.

Ammonia and the astrocyte play major roles in such alterations, which affect several components of the brain glutamate system, namely its synthesis, intercellular transport (uptake and release), and function. In addition to the neurological symptoms of hepatic encephalopathy, modified glutamatergic regulation may contribute to other cerebral complications of liver failure, such as brain edema, intracranial hypertension and changes in cerebral blood flow. A better understanding of the cause and precise nature of the alterations of the brain glutamate system in liver failure could lead to new therapeutic avenues for the cerebral complications of liver disease.

Implication of the proprotein convertase NARC-1/PCSK9 in the development of the nervous system	JOURNAL OF NEUROCHEMISTRY			English	Article						cholesterol; neural apoptosis-regulated convertase-1/proprotein convertase subtilisin-kexin like-9; neurogenesis; P19 cells; proprotein convertase; zebrafish	EMBRYONAL CARCINOMA-CELLS; AUTOSOMAL-DOMINANT HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA; NEURONAL DIFFERENTIATION; PROHORMONE CONVERTASES; SECRETORY PATHWAY; GENE-EXPRESSION; KNOCKOUT MICE; LDL RECEPTOR; TARGET GENES; ZEBRAFISH	Neural apoptosis-regulated convertase-1/proprotein convertase subtilisin-kexin like-9 (NARC-1/PCSK9) is a proprotein convertase recently described to play a major role in cholesterol homeostasis through enhanced degradation of the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) and possibly in neural development. Herein, we investigated the potential involvement of this proteinase in the development of the CNS using mouse embryonal pluripotent P19 cells and the zebrafish as models. Time course quantitative RT-PCR analyses were performed following retinoic acid (RA)-induced neuroectodermal differentiation of P19 cells. Accordingly, the mRNA levels of NARC-1/PCSK9 peaked at day 2 of differentiation and fell off thereafter. In contrast, the expression of the proprotein convertases subtilisin kexin isozyme 1/site 1 protease and Furin was unaffected by RA, whereas that of PC5/6 and PC2 increased within and/or after the first 4 days of the differentiation period respectively. This pattern was not affected by the cholesterogenic transcription factor sterol regulatory element-binding protein-2, which normally up-regulates NARC-1/PCSK9 mRNA levels in liver. Furthermore, in P19 cells, RA treatment did not affect the protein level of the endogenous LDLR. This agrees with the unique expression pattern of NARC-1/PCSK9 in the rodent CNS, including the cerebellum, where the LDLR is not significantly expressed. Whole-mount in situ hybridization revealed that the pattern of expression of zebrafish NARC-1/PCSK9 is similar to that of mouse both in the CNS and periphery. Specific knockdown of zebrafish NARC-1/PCSK9 mRNA resulted in a general disorganization of cerebellar neurons and loss of hindbrain-midbrain boundaries, leading to embryonic death at similar to 96 h after fertilization. These data support a novel role for NARC-1/PCSK9 in CNS development, distinct from that in cholesterogenic organs such as liver.

The temporal and spatial profile of its effect on the brain is unknown. We used proton magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging to evaluate the neuronal response to 1 day of riluzole treatment in motor and non-motor regions of the brain. In 10 patients the N-acetylaspartate/total creatine (NAA/Cr) ratio increased in the precentral gyrus and supplementary motor area, but not in the post-central gyrus or parietal lobe. Improvement in cortical neuronal metabolic function in the motor cortex occurs early with riluzole treatment.

Their responses to low-and high-intensity mechanical stimulation of their receptive fields (RFs) were recorded before and after the application of irritant agents [ capsaicin ( CAP) or mustard oil ( MO)] to the RF. Before the applications of the irritants the neurons responded only to high-intensity stimuli, but after this procedure 20 of 28 neurons tested were sensitized, i.e., gave increased responses to high-intensity stimuli and showed novel responses to low-intensity mechanical stimulation as well as an A beta-fiber afferent drive. CAP was more likely to induce sensitization than MO and the majority of sensitized neurons were located in the superficial dorsal horn. No relationship was found between the magnitude of the response to the sensitizing agent and the presence or absence of sensitization. Cumulative doses of two gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA(A))-receptor antagonists, picrotoxin and bicuculline, were administered systemically or applied directly over the spinal cord. The GABA(A) antagonists reversed the sensitization of the neurons by reducing the novel low-threshold responses. These results show that NS neurons in the spinal dorsal horn can be sensitized by a sustained afferent discharge in peripheral nociceptors and that this sensitization can be reduced or reversed by low doses of GABA(A)-receptor antagonists. This provides evidence for a mechanism in which an enhanced GABAergic transmission can lead to hyperexcitability and sensitization of NS neurons in the dorsal horn.

Vascular complications of the surgery for vestibular schwannomas (VSs) can have devastating consequences; however, there is scant literature on the systematic analysis of the different types of complications. In this context, the authors of this study analyzed these complications, with particular interest in the role of surgical approach in their occurrence. Methods. The charts of 391 patients who had undergone 413 procedures for VS during a 24-year period were reviewed retrospectively. A suboccipital retrosigmoid (RS) approach was used in 338 procedures, and the translabyrinthine (TL) route in 75. Postoperative hemorrhage or infarction was identified and stratified according to the complication type and surgical approach. Postoperative vascular complications were encountered in 11 procedures (2.7%), and their incidence was the same for both the RS and TL approaches. Of these complications, eight were hemorrhagic (two cerebellopontine angle one intracerebellar, and five epidural hematomas) and three were ischemic in nature. Five patients (45.4%) had a complete recovery, and four patients (36.4%) a partial recovery; two patients (18.2%) died. The overall procedure-related mortality rate was 0.5% (two of 413 procedures): 0.3% (one of 338 procedures) for the RS approach and 1.3% (one of 75 procedures) for the TL approach (p > 0.05). Conclusions. In this study, the overall incidences of vascular complications in VS surgery were similar for the RS and TL approaches. Regardless of the preferred surgical route, this group of complications carries a significant risk of morbidity and therefore warrants special consideration in the management of VSs.

The degree of reduction in proptosis following surgical intervention remains difficult to predict. Objectives: To elaborate a human model using cadaver orbits to study surgical management of Graves' ophthalmopathy. To evaluate quantitatively the contribution of each orbital wall decompression and their combinations in reduction in proptosis. To improve the ability to predict the degree of proptosis reduction according to the wall(s) chosen for decompression. Methods: Artificial exophthalmos was created in 12 cadavers' orbits by injecting a polysaccharide gel in the peribulbar and retrobulbar tissues. Proptosis reduction was measured following successive orbital decompression. Results: Decompression of one wall produced a nonstatistical significant reduction in proptosis. The combination of the medial and lateral walls significantly reduced the proptosis by a mean of 4.2 mm. Three-wall decompression gave a mean significant reduction of 6.6 mm, and when combined with the advancement of the lateral wall, it reduced proptosis by 12.5 mm. Conclusions: We created an experimental model for research and didactic purposes for surgical management of Graves' ophthalmopathy. With this model, to obtain 5 mm or more of proptosis reduction, three-wall decompression is required. Advancement of the lateral wall achieved a further reduction in proptosis. For a proptosis reduction of less than 5 mm, decompression of the medial and lateral walls is appropriate.

J	Dorr, AE; Debonnel, G				Dorr, Adrienne E.; Debonnel, Guy			Effect of vagus nerve stimulation on serotonergic and noradrenergic transmission	JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY AND EXPERIMENTAL THERAPEUTICS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	35th Annual Meeting of the Society-for-Neuroscience	2005	Washington, DC	Soc Neurosci			LOCUS-COERULEUS; FIRING ACTIVITY; ANTIDEPRESSANT ACTION; MIDBRAIN RAPHE; DORSAL RAPHE; DEPRESSION; NEURONS; RAT; NOREPINEPHRINE; ANTAGONISTS	Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is an antiepileptic treatment, which has recently shown promise as an antidepressant. Yet, its antidepressant mechanisms of action are unknown. Serotonergic [5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT, serotonin)] and noradrenergic [norepinephrine ( NE)] systems are involved in the pathophysiology of depression and in the mechanisms of action of antidepressants. The present study analyzes 5-HT and NE neuronal firing rates in their brainstem nuclei: the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) and locus coeruleus (LC), respectively. The basal firing rates in the DRN and LC were significantly increased after long-term treatments with VNS. After short-term VNS treatments, firing rates were significantly higher for LC (at 1 h and 3 days). As changes in their firing rate may have been due to altered autoreceptor sensitivities, the responses of autoreceptors to the acute administration of their respective agonists were assessed. However, no significant difference was seen in the DRN. No significant differences in dose response curves for 5-HT1A somatodendritic and alpha(2)-adrenergic autoreceptors were noticed between long-term VNS and controls. VNS appears to have a novel mechanism of antidepressant action, enabling its effectiveness in treatment-resistant depression. LC firing rates significantly increase earlier than the DRN basal firing. As the LC has an excitatory influence on DRN, it is possible that the increased DRN firing rate is secondary to an initial increased LC firing rate from VNS.

Methods: The study subject was a male infant with keratitis-ichthyosis-deafness (KID) syndrome. We performed a nucleotide sequence analysis of GJB2 and a histopathologic analysis of the temporal bones. Results: The subject was heterozygous for G45E, a previously reported KID syndrome mutation of GJB2. The primary inner ear abnormality was dysplasia of the cochlear and saccular neuroepithelium. Conclusions: GJB2 mutations can cause deafness in KID syndrome, and possibly in other GJB2 mutant phenotypes, by disrupting cochlear differentiation.

While the trafficking of the TrkA:NGF complex is well characterized, little is known about p75NTR:BDNF trafficking in these neurons. Here we show that BDNF binds to and appears inside sympathetic neurons relatively slowly, although the temperature-sensitive internalization step itself is rapid. P75NTR internalization is partially sensitive to disruption of clathrin- or raft-mediated internalization, while that of TrkA is entirely clathrin-mediated. P75NTR, but not Trk, associates with neurotrophins in lipid rafts and coimmunoprecipitates with the truncated beta-caveolin-1 isoform. Finally, we directly visualize the retrograde transport of p75NTR ligands to cell bodies, which is insensitive to inhibitors of Trk retrograde transport, suggesting mechanistic differences. We postulate that beta-caveolin-1-containing lipid rafts and possibly intracellular endosomes might be compartments to which p75NTR:BDNF complexes are trafficked separately from Trk.

CgA has been proposed to play multiple roles in the secretory process. Intracellularly, CgA may control secretory granule biogenesis and target neurotransmitters and peptide hormones to granules of the regulated pathway. Extracellularly, peptides formed as a result of proteolytic processing of CgA may regulate hormone secretion. To investigate the role of CgA in the whole animal, we created a mouse mutant null for the Chga gene. These mice are viable and fertile and have no obvious developmental abnormalities, and their neural and endocrine functions are not grossly impaired. Their adrenal glands were structurally unremarkable, and morphometric analyses of chromaffin cells showed vesicle size and number to be normal. However, the excretion of epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine was significantly elevated in the Chga null mutants. Adrenal medullary mRNA and protein levels of other dense-core secretory granule proteins including chromogranin B, and secretogranins II to VI were up-regulated 2- to 3-fold in the Chga null mutant mice.

Although considered a disease of infancy, some patients develop symptoms in childhood, adolescence, or adulthood. The gene responsible for cblC, MMACHC, was recently identified. We studied phenotype-genotype correlations in 37 patients from published case-reports, representing most of the landmark descriptions of this disease. 25/37 had early-onset disease, presenting in the first 6 months of life: 17/25 were found to be either homozygous for the c.271dupA mutation (n = 9) or for the c.331C > T mutation (n = 3), or compound heterozygotes for these 2 mutations (n = 5). 9/12 late-onset cases presented with acute neurological symptoms: 4/9 were homozygous for the c.394C > T mutation, 2/9 were compound heterozygotes for the c.271dupA and c.394C > T mutations, and 3/9, for the c.271dupA mutation and a missense mutation. Several observations on ethnic origins were noted: the c.331 C > T mutation is seen in Cajun and French-Canadian patients and the c.394C > T mutation is common in the Asiatic-Indian/Pakistani/Middle Eastern populations. The recognition of phenotype-genotype correlations and the association of mutations with specific ethnicities will be useful for identification of disease-causing mutations in cblC patients, for carrier detection and prenatal diagnosis in families where mutations are known, and in setting up initial screening programs in molecular diagnostic laboratories. Further study into disease mechanism of specific mutations will help to understand phenotypic presentations and the overall pathogenesis in cblC patients. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Because sensory neuron-specific receptors (SNSRs) and the opioid receptors (OR) share a common ligand, the bovine adrenal medulla peptide (BAM) 22, and have opposite effects on pain modulation, we investigated the possible consequences of delta OR/ SNSR-4 hetero-oligomerization on the signaling properties of both receptor subtypes. Bioluminescence resonance energy transfer revealed that the human delta OR has similar propensity to homo-oligomerize and to form hetero-oligomers with human SNSR-4 when coexpressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells. The hetero-oligomerization leads to a receptor form displaying unique functional properties. Individual activation of either delta OR or SNSR-4 in cells coexpressing the two receptors led to the modulation of their respective signaling pathways; inhibition of adenylyl cyclase and activation of phospholipase C, respectively. In contrast, the delta OR/SNSR-4 bivalent agonist BAM22, which could activate each receptor expressed individually, fully activated the SNSR-4-dependent phospholipase C but did not promote delta OR-mediated inhibition of adenylyl cyclase in delta OR/SNSR-4-coexpressing cells. Likewise, concomitant activation of the delta OR/SNSR-4-hetero-oligomer by selective delta OR and SNSR-4 agonists promoted SNSR-4 but not delta OR signaling, revealing an agonist-dependent dominant-negative effect of SNSR-4 on delta OR signaling. Furthermore, the delta OR selective antagonist naltrexone trans-inhibited the SNSR-4-promoted phospholipase C activation mediated by BAM22 but not by the SNSR-4-selective agonists, suggesting a bivalent binding mode of BAM22 to the delta OR/SNSR-4 hetero-oligomer. The observation that BAM22 inhibited the Leu-enkephalin-promoted cAMP inhibition in rat dorsal root ganglia neurons supports the potential physiological implication of such regulatory mechanism.

A regulated interaction with the UIM protein Eps15 implicates parkin in EGF receptor trafficking and PI(3) K-Akt signalling	NATURE CELL BIOLOGY			English	Article							GROWTH-FACTOR RECEPTOR; RECESSIVE JUVENILE PARKINSONISM; UBIQUITIN-BINDING PROTEINS; ENDOCYTIC PATHWAY; GENE; DISEASE; MOTIF; MONOUBIQUITINATION; ACTIVATION; MUTATIONS	Mutations in the parkin gene are responsible for a common familial form of Parkinson's disease(1,2). As parkin encodes an E3 ubiquitin ligase(3), defects in proteasome-mediated protein degradation are believed to have a central role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease(4). Here, we report a novel role for parkin in a proteasome-independent ubiquitination pathway. We have identified a regulated interaction between parkin and Eps15, an adaptor protein that is involved in epidermal growth factor ( EGF) receptor ( EGFR) endocytosis and trafficking(5). Treatment of cells with EGF stimulates parkin binding to both Eps15 and the EGFR and promotes parkin-mediated ubiquitination of Eps15. Binding of the parkin ubiquitin-like ( Ubl) domain to the Eps15 ubiquitin-interacting motifs ( UIMs) is required for parkin-mediated Eps15 ubiquitination. Furthermore, EGFR endocytosis and degradation are accelerated in parkin-deficient cells, and EGFR signalling via the phosphoinositide 3-kinase ( PI( 3) K)Akt pathway is reduced in parkin knockout mouse brain. We propose that by ubiquitinating Eps15, parkin interferes with the ability of the Eps15 UIMs to bind ubiquitinated EGFR(6-8), thereby delaying EGFR internalization and degradation, and promoting PI( 3)K-Akt signalling. Considering the role of Akt in neuronal survival(9), our results have broad new implications for understanding the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease.

Evidence exists for a perturbation of innate immunity as a primary pathogenic event in the disease phenotype(3). Here, we show that TREX1, encoding the major mammalian 3'-> 5' DNA exonuclease(4), is the AGS1 gene, and AGS-causing mutations result in abrogation of TREX1 enzyme activity. Similar loss of function in the Trex1(-/-) mouse leads to an inflammatory phenotype(5). Our findings suggest an unanticipated role for TREX1 in processing or clearing anomalous DNA structures, failure of which results in the triggering of an abnormal innate immune response.

To control for the effects of anatomic variation between subject groups, all participants' diffusion images were non-linearly registered to standard anatomical space. Significant statistical differences in mean diffusivity (MD) measures between the two groups were determined on a pixel-by-pixel basis, using Gaussian random field theory. We found significantly elevated MD measures within temporal, parietal and prefrontal cortical regions in the schizophrenia group (P > 0.001), especially within the medial frontal gyrus and anterior cingulate. The dorsal medial and anterior nucleus of the thalamus, including the caudate, also exhibited significantly increased MD in the schizophrenia group (P > 0.001). This study has shown for the first time that MD measures offer an alternative strategy for investigating altered prefrontal-thalamic circuitry in schizophrenia. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Simulations can be an extremely helpful tool for validation because ground truth is known. We created the digital brain phantom that is at the heart of our publicly available database of realistic simulated magnetic resonance image (MRI) volumes known as BrainWeb. Even though the digital phantom had 1 mm(3) isotropic voxel size and a small number of tissue classes, the BrainWeb database has been used in more than one hundred peer-reviewed publications validating different image processing methods. In this paper, we describe the next step in the natural evolution of BrainWeb: the creation of digital brain phantom 11 that includes three major improvements over the original phantom. First, the realism of the phantom, and the resulting simulations, was improved by modeling more tissue classes to include blood vessels, bone marrow and dura mater classes. In addition. a more realistic skull class was created. The latter is particularly useful for SPECT, PET and CT simulations for which bone attenuation has an important effect. Second, the phantom was improved by an eight-fold reduction in voxel volume to 0.125 mm(3). Third, the method used to create the new phantom was modified not only to take into account the segmentation of these new structures, but also to take advantage of many more automated procedures now available. The overall process has reduced subjectivity and manual intervention when compared to the original phantom, and the process may be easily applied to create phantoms from other subjects. MRI simulations are shown to illustrate the difference between the previous and the new improved digital brain phantom II. Example PET and SPECT simulations are also presented. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

While many methods exist to select regions (Step 1), very little is available to complete Step 2. The two main methods developed so far, structural equation modeling (SENI) and dynamical causal modeling (DCM), usually require precise prior information to be used, while such information is sometimes lacking. Assuming that Step I was successfully completed, we here propose a data-driven method to deal with Step 2 and extract functional interactions from fMRI datasets through partial correlations. Partial correlation is more closely related to effective connectivity than marginal correlation and provides a convenient graphical representation for functional interactions. As an instance of brain interactivity investigation, we consider how simple hand movements are processed by the bihemispheric cortical motor network. In the proposed framework, Bayesian analysis makes it possible to estimate and test the partial statistical dependencies between regions without any prior model on the underlying functional interactions. We demonstrate the interest of this approach on real data. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Iron contributes to dopamine-induced toxicity in oligodendrocyte progenitors	NEUROPATHOLOGY AND APPLIED NEUROBIOLOGY			English	Article						apoptosis; cell death; dopamine; iron; myelin; oligodendrocytes; oxidative stress; periventricular leucomalacia	EXPERIMENTAL ALLERGIC ENCEPHALOMYELITIS; AUTOIMMUNE-MEDIATED DEMYELINATION; FREE-RADICAL GENERATION; TRAUMATIC BRAIN-INJURY; OXIDATIVE STRESS; CELL-DEATH; HEME OXYGENASE-1; HYPOXIA-ISCHEMIA; WHITE-MATTER; PERIVENTRICULAR LEUKOMALACIA	Iron is potentially toxic to oligodendrocyte progenitors due to its high intracellular levels and its ability to catalyse oxidant-producing reactions. Oxidative stress resulting from a hypoxic-ischaemic insult has been implicated in death of oligodendrocyte progenitors that occurs in the hypomyelinating disorder periventricular leucomalacia. Ischaemic insults induce the release of various neurotransmitters, including dopamine (DA), and we previously showed that DA is toxic to cultured oligodendrocytes, by inducing oxidative stress and apoptosis. Therefore, we investigated the role of iron in DA-induced cell death in oligodendrocyte progenitors. Intracellular iron levels were altered using an iron chelator, deferoxamine (DFO), and supplementation with ferrous sulphate (FeSO4). Addition of FeSO4 to cultures increased DA-induced toxicity as assessed by mitochondrial dehydrogenase activity and cellular release of lactate dehydrogenase. Furthermore, FeSO4 increased expression of the stress protein heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), nuclear condensation and caspase-3 activation. In contrast, preincubation with DFO reduced these events as well as cleavage of alpha-spectrin, a caspase-3 substrate. In addition, FeSO4 reversed the protective effect of DFO on DA-induced cytotoxicity, HO-1 expression and caspase-3 activation. These results indicate that elevated levels of free iron contribute to DA-induced toxicity in oligodendrocyte progenitors.

We applied density (B-max) of platelet [H-3-]paroxetine binding as a proxy for central 5-HT reuptake activity in two groups of women (33 with BN-spectrum disorders and 19 with no apparent eating or psychiatric disorders), most of these individuals' mothers (31 and 18, respectively), and a small sampling of their sisters (seven and eight, respectively), Hierarchical linear modeling techniques were used to account for nesting of individuals within families and diagnostic groupings. Bulimic probands, their mothers, and their sisters all displayed significantly lower density (B-max) of platelet-paroxetine binding than did 'control' probands, mothers, or sisters-even when relatives showing apparent eating or psychiatric disturbances were excluded. In addition, in bulimic probands and mothers, significant within-family correlations were obtained on B-max. These findings imply a heritable trait (or endophenotype), linked to 5-HT activity, and carried by BN sufferers and their first-degree relatives (even when asymptomatic). We propose that, under conducive circumstances, such a trait may increase risk of binge-eating behavior, or associated symptoms of affective or behavioral dysregulation.

In both the central (CNS) and peripheral nervous systems (PNS), purines in the form of adenosine triphosphate and adenosine can play a number of roles in neuronal activation and inhibition. In addition, purines are known to be important for glial cell signaling in both the CNS and PNS. In the PNS, the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) is an excellent model for studying simple synaptic interactions. It is well suited to investigations of neuron-glia interactions because synaptic properties are well defined and perisynaptic Schwann cells (PSCs), glial cells at the NMJ, dynamically interact with the pre- and postsynaptic elements. At the NMJ, purines are critical for presynaptic modulation but also for neuron-glia interactions. Purines signal to PSCs through metabotropic and ionotropic receptors and activation of these receptors can have both modulatory and activating functions. This review will discuss recent developments in our understanding of purinergic modulation of the NMJ with an emphasis on the involvement of purines in neuron-glia interactions at this synapse.

Neuroactive steroids (NAS) refers to steroids that, independent of their origin, are capable of modifying neural activities. NAS bind and modulate different types of membrane receptors. The gamma amino butyric acid (GABA) and sigma receptor complexes have been the most extensively studied. Oxidized ring A reduced pregnanes, tetrahydroprogesterone (THP), and tetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone (THDOC) bind to the progesterone intracellular receptor (PR), and in this way can also regulate gene expression. Animal experimentation showed that salient symptoms of depression, viz., anxiety, sleep disturbances, and memory and sexual dysfunctions, are modulated by NAS. In turn, psychotropic drugs modulate NS and NAS levels. NS levels as well as NAS plasma concentrations change in patients with depression syndromes, the levels return to normal baseline with recovery, but normalization is not necessary for successful therapy. Results from current studies on the evolution of nervous systems, including evolutionary developmental biology as well as anatomical and physiological findings, almost preclude a categorical classification of the psychiatric ailments the human brain succumbs to. The persistence in maintaining such essentialist classifications may help to explain why up to now the search for biological markers in psychiatry has been an unrewarding effort. It is proposed that it would be more fruitful to focus on relationships between NAS and symptoms of psychiatric disorders, rather than with typologically defined disorders.

From Malthus to motive: How the HPA axis engineers the phenotype, yoking needs to wants	PROGRESS IN NEUROBIOLOGY			English	Review						hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis; stress; phenotypic plasticity; energy balance; motivation	CORTICOTROPIN-RELEASING-FACTOR; PITUITARY-ADRENAL AXIS; HYPOTHALAMIC PARAVENTRICULAR NUCLEUS; MEDIAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; LOCUS-COERULEUS NEURONS; SCHEDULE-INDUCED-POLYDIPSIA; VENTRAL TEGMENTAL AREA; PLASMA-CORTICOSTERONE LEVELS; MESOLIMBIC DOPAMINE SYSTEM; MESSENGER-RIBONUCLEIC-ACID	The hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is the critical mediator of the vertebrate stress response system, responding to environmental stressors by maintaining internal homeostasis and coupling the needs of the body to the wants of the mind. The HPA axis has numerous complex drivers and highly flexible operating characterisitics. Major drivers include two circadian drivers, two extra-hypothalamic networks controlling top-down (psychogenic) and bottom-up (systemic) threats, and two intra-hypothalamic networks coordinating behavioral, autonomic, and neuroendocrine outflows. These various networks jointly and flexibly control HPA axis output of periodic (oscillatory) functions and a range of adventitious systemic or psychological threats, including predictable daily cycles of energy flow, actual metabolic deficits over many time scales, predicted metabolic deficits, and the state-dependent management of post-prandial responses to feeding. Evidence is provided that reparation of metabolic derangement by either food or glucocorticoids results in a metabolic signal that inhibits HPA activity. In short, the HPA axis is intimately involved in managing and remodeling peripheral energy fluxes, which appear to provide an unidentified metabolic inhibitory feedback signal to the HPA axis via glucocorticoids. In a complementary and perhaps a less appreciated role, adrenocortical hormones also act on brain to provide not only feedback, but feedforward control over the HPA axis itself and its various drivers, as well as coordinating behavioral and autonomic outflows, and mounting central incentive and memorial networks that are adaptive in both appetitive and aversive motivational modes. By centrally remodeling the phenotype, the HPA axis provides ballistic and predictive control over motor outflows relevant to the type of stressor. Evidence is examined concerning the global hypothesis that the HPA axis comprehensively induces integrative phenotypic plasticity, thus remodeling the body and its governor, the brain, to yoke the needs of the body to the wants of the mind. Adverse side effects of this yoking under conditions of glucocorticoid excess are discussed. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Processes of inference, schizotypal thinking, and obsessive-compulsive behaviour in a normal sample	PSYCHOLOGICAL REPORTS			English	Article							DISORDER; PERSONALITY; DELUSIONS; CONFUSION	Previous research has shown inferential confusion as measured by the Inferential Confusion Questionnaire to be related to obsessive-compulsive symptoms. A total of 108 participants (41 men and 66 women) from a normal population in The Netherlands (M age = 46 yr., SD = 155) completed a package of questionnaires measuring inferential confusion, schizotypal symptoms, and obsessive-compulsive behaviour. As expected, scores for both inferential confusion and schizotypal symptoms were significantly related to those for obsessive-compulsive behaviour. In addition, analysis showed that inferential confusion and schizotypal symptoms shared common variance, but both predicted an independent portion of the variance in obsessive-compulsive behaviour while controlling for neuroticism. The present results call for further inquiry into the role of inferential confusion and schizotypal thinking in obsessive-compulsive behaviour.

However, leptin has no effect on footshock- or heroin-priming-induced reinstatement of drug seeking. These data may indicate that the neuronal systems underlying food-deprivation-induced reinstatement are dissociable from those involved in reinstatement induced by footshock stress. Objectives We used the reinstatement procedure to examine the roles of the adrenal stress hormone, corticosterone, and brain corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) in acute food-deprivation-induced reinstatement of extinguished heroin seeking in rats. Materials and methods The rats were trained to press a lever for heroin (0.05-0.1 mg/kg/infusion, i.v.) for 10 days. Experiment 1: After heroin self-administration training, the rats were divided into two groups, which received either bilateral adrenalectomy surgery or sham surgery. Next, the rats were given 7-10 days of extinction training (during which lever presses were not reinforced with heroin). The rats were subsequently tested for reinstatement after acute (21 h) food deprivation. Experiment 2: After heroin self-administration and extinction training, the rats were tested for reinstatement induced by acute food deprivation. Before the test session, the rats were given intracerebroventricular injections of the CRF receptor antagonist a-helical CRF (0, 3, or 10 mu g/rat). Results Adrenalectomy had no effect on the extinction behavior or acute food-deprivation-induced reinstatement of heroin seeking. The CRF receptor antagonist, a-helical CRF, dose-dependently blocked food-deprivation-induced reinstatement. Conclusions The present data suggest that, as demonstrated for footshock-induced reinstatement of drug seeking, brain CRF, but not corticosterone, plays a critical role in acute food-deprivation-induced reinstatement of heroin seeking.

This synergy is mediated via interactions between eIF4G (a component of the eIF4F cap binding complex) and poly(A) binding protein (PABP). Paip2 (PABP-interacting protein 2) binds PABP and inhibits translation both in vitro and in vivo by decreasing the affinity of PABP for polyadenylated RNA. Here, we describe the functional characteristics of Paip2B, a Paip2 homolog. A full-length brain cDNA of Paip2B encodes a protein that shares 59% identity and 80% similarity with Paip2 (Paip2A), with the highest conservation in the two PABP binding domains. Paip2B acts in a manner similar to Paip2A to inhibit translation of capped and polyadenylated mRNAs both in vitro and in vivo by displacing PABP from the poly(A) tail. Also, similar to Paip2A, Paip2B does not affect the translation mediated by the internal ribosome entry site (IRES) of hepatitis C virus (HCV). However, Paip2A and Paip2B differ with respect to both mRNA and protein distribution in different tissues and cell lines. Paip2A is more highly ubiquitinated than is Paip2B and is degraded more rapidly by the proteasome. Paip2 protein degradation may constitute a primary mechanism by which cells regulate PABP activity in translation.

As part of our efforts in the Brazilian Amazon to maximize nutritional input from fish consumption, a dietary mainstay, and minimize toxic risk, we have been studying the role of selenium (Se), an essential element, that may influence the distribution of Hg in the body and influence Hg neurotoxicity. Se, which is naturally present in the soil, is ingested through consumption of various foods, notably fish, mammals and certain plants. The objectives of the present study were: (i) evaluate whole blood Se (B-Se) and Hg (B-Hg); (ii) characterize B-Se variations with respect to socio-demographic and dietary variables; and (iii) examine the relation between B-Se and B-Hg. A total of 236 persons from six riparian communities of the Tapajos River Basin, a tributary of the Amazon, participated in this study. Whole blood Se and Hg were measured and interview administered questionnaires were used to obtain data on socio-demographic variable, smoking and drinking habits, and fish and fruit consumption. The results show that B-Se are in the upper normal range (median=284.3 mu g/ L, range= 142.1-2029.3 mu g/L). No individuals presented B-Se deficiency, but 9 participants from the same extended family had relatively high B-Se levels, potentially a threat to their health. B-Se varied between communities, was significantly higher among alcohol drinkers and farmers, but not associated with age, sex or tobacco consumption. A significant positive relation between B-Se and B-Hg was noted, independently of the overall fish consumption. B-Se increased with consumption of Peacock bass (Cichla sp.), a piscivorous fish species, and coconut pulp (Cocos nucifera L.). The B-Se intercommunity variations may reflect geographic differences in local soil Se levels as well as traditional land use practices in the different ecosystems of the Tapajos River Basin. In this population with relatively high exposure to Hg, Se may play an important role. Further studies should examine, in this region, the sources of Se, its transmission through the terrestrial and aquatic ecosystem and its role with respect to human health.

Unipolar electrograms were recorded from 191 sites on the entire epicardial atrial surface and, in some experiments, from 63 right atrial endocardial sites. The sites of origin of initial beats at the onset of atrial tachyarrhythmias so induced were investigated analysing atrial activation maps. Neural effects on repolarization were determined by computing the integral surface subtended by unipolar recordings under basal conditions and at maximum neurally induced bradycardia, and calculating differences at each recording site. The mean area affected by nerve stimulation in all animals was significantly greater in response to vagosympathetic than mediastinal nerve stimulation. Atrial cycle length prolongation prior to tachyarrhythmia onset was more pronounced in response to vagosympathetic than mediastinal nerve stimulation. The earliest epicardial activations in early tachyarrhythmia beats were localized in the right atrial free wall and Bachmann bundle region in both cases, but with a higher incidence of double breakthroughs from septal sites of origin in response to vagosympathetic versus mediastinal nerve stimulation. Sites of early activation were associated with the areas of neurally induced repolarization changes. Thus, differential contributions are made to the electrophysiologic substrate of neurally induced atrial tachyarrhythmias depending on the pattern of engagement of neural elements within the autonomic neuronal hierarchy.

The cannabinoid WIN 55,212-2 inhibits transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) and evokes peripheral antihyperalgesia via calcineurin	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						desensitization; pain; capsaicin; TRPA1; dephosphorylation	DEPENDENT PROTEIN-KINASE; ROOT GANGLION NEURONS; N-ARACHIDONOYL-DOPAMINE; IN-SITU HYBRIDIZATION; RAT SENSORY NEURONS; TRIGEMINAL GANGLION; CAPSAICIN RECEPTOR; MICE LACKING; DESENSITIZATION; PAIN	Cannabinoids can evoke antihyperalgesia and antinociception at a peripheral site of action. However, the signaling pathways mediating these effects are not clearly understood. We tested the hypothesis that certain cannabinoids directly inhibit peripheral capsaicin-sensitive nociceptive neurons by dephosphorylating and desensitizing transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) via a calcium calcineurin-dependent mechanism. Application of the cannabinoid WIN 55,212-2 (WIN)to cultured trigeminal (TG) neurons or isolated skin biopsies rapidly and significantly inhibited capsaicin-activated inward currents and neuropeptide exocytosis by a mechanism requiring the presence of extracellular calcium. The inhibitory effect did not involve activation of G protein-coupled cannabinoid receptors, because neither pertussis toxin nor GDP beta S treatments altered the WIN effect. However, application of WIN-activated calcineurin, as measured by nuclear translocation of the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT)c4 transcription factor, dephosphorylated TRPV1. The WIN-induced desensitization of TRPV1 was mediated by calcineurin, because the application of structurally distinct calcineurin antagonists (calcineurin autoinhibitory peptide and cyclosporine/cyclophilin complex) abolished WIN-induced inhibition of capsaicin-evoked inward currents and neuropeptide exocytosis. This mechanism also contributed to peripheral antinociceptive/antihyperalgesic effects of WIN because pretreatment with the calcineurin antagonist calcineurin autoinhibitory peptide (CAIP) significantly reduced peripherally mediated WIN effects in two behavioral models. Collectively, these data demonstrate that cannabinoids such as WIN directly inhibit TRPV1 functional activities via a calcineurin pathway that represents a mechanism of cannabinoid actions at peripheral sites.

However, the importance of nuclear phosphatidylcholine ( PC) metabolism is poorly understood. Therefore, we were interested in nuclear PCs as a source of second messengers and, particularly, nuclear phospholipase D (PLD) identification in membrane-free nuclei isolated from pig aorta vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). Using immunoblot experiment, in vitro PLD assay with fluorescent substrate and confocal microscopy analysis, we demonstrated that only PLD1 is expressed in VSMC nucleus, whereas PLD1 and PLD2 are present in VSMC. Inhibition of RhoA and protein kinase C zeta (PKC zeta) by C3-exoenzyme and PKC zeta pseudosubstrate inhibitor, respectively, conducted a decrease of phosphatidylethanol production. On the other hand, treatment of intact VSMCs, but not nuclei, with phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitors prevented partially nuclear PLD1 activity, indicating for the first time that PI3K may have a role in nuclear PLD regulation. In addition, lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) or angiotensin II treatment of VSMCs resulted in an increase of intranuclear PLD activity, whereas platelet-derived growth factor and epidermal growth factor have no significant effect. Moreover, pertussis toxin induced a decrease of LPA-stimulated nuclear PLD1 activity, suggesting that heterotrimeric G(i)/G(0) protein involvement in intranuclear PLD1 regulation. We also show that LPA-induced nuclear PLD1 activation implied PI3K/PKC zeta pathway activation and PKC zeta nuclear translocation as well as nuclear RhoA activation. Thus, the characterization of an endogenous PLD1 that could regulate PC metabolism inside VSMC nucleus provides a new role for this enzyme in control of vascular fibroproliferative disorders.

In this study, we have used the Xenopus embryonic system to de. ne the role of various Met proximal-binding partners and downstream signaling pathways in regulating an induced morphogenetic event. We show that expression of an oncogenic derivative of the Met receptor (Tpr-Met) induces ectopic morphogenetic structures during Xenopus embryogenesis. Using variant forms of Tpr-Met that are engineered to recruit a specific signaling molecule of choice, we demonstrate that the sole recruitment of either the Grb2 or the Shc adaptor protein is sufficient to induce ectopic structures and anterior reduction, while the recruitment of PI-3Kinase (PI-3K) is necessary but not sufficient for this effect. In contrast, the recruitment of PLC gamma can initiate the induction, but fails to maintain or elongate supernumerary structures. Finally, evidence indicates that the Ras/Raf/MAPK pathway is necessary, but not sufficient to induce these structures. This study also emphasizes the importance of examining signaling molecules in the regulatory context that is provided by receptor/effector interactions when assessing a role in cell growth and differentiation.

From post-natal day (PD) 1 to PD 21, male pups from each strain were assigned to a same-strain dam (in-fostered) or were cross-fostered, and at adulthood were implanted with a guide cannula over the lateral ventricle. They were then tested for locomotion and hypothermia following injection of vehicle, 0.18, 1.8 or 18 nmol of NT or D-Tyr([11]). In-fostered LEW, but not F344, displayed a strong dose-orderly hypothermic response to NT and to D-Tyr([11])INT while in-fostered F344, but not LEW, rats displayed strong locomotor responses to D-Tyr([11])NT. Cross-fostering had no effect on D-Tyr([11])NT-induced locomotor responses in either strain; it had no effect also on NT- and D-Tyr([11])NT-induced hypothermia in F344 rats while it slightly increased the sensitivity to NT in LEW rats. The results show that these NT-mediated actions are not influenced by cross-fostering or the pre-weaning environment. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This does not only open a window to address the basic mechanisms underlying human disease, such as epilepsy, but it allows to venture into investigating neurophysiological functions per se. In the present paper, we describe the most commonly used methods in the electrophysiological (and, at least to some extent, also histochemical and molecular) analysis of human tissue in vitro. In addition, we consider the pitfalls and limitations of such studies, in particular regarding the issue of tissue sampling procedures and control experiments. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Ever since its adoption as a research tool, there has been great interest regarding its potential clinical role. Presently, it is unclear whether rTMS will have some role as an alternative treatment for neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD). To date, studies addressing the contribution of placebo during rTMS are missing. The placebo effect has been shown to be associated either with release of dopamine in the striatum or with changes in brain glucose metabolism. The main objective of this study was to test whether, in patients with PD, the expectation of therapeutic benefit from rTMS, which actually was delivered only as sham rTMS (placebo-rTMS) induced changes in striatal [C-11] raclopride binding potentials (BP) as measured with positron emission tomography (PET). Placebo-rTMS induced a significant bilateral reduction in [C-11] raclopride BP in dorsal and ventral striatum as compared to the baseline condition. This reduction BP is indicative of an increase in dopamine neurotransmission. The changes in [C-11] raclopride binding were more evident in the hemisphere contralateral to the more affected side supporting the hypothesis that the more severe the symptoms, the greater the drive for symptom relief, and therefore the placebo response. This is the first study addressing the placebo contribution during rTMS. While our results seem to confirm earlier evidence that expectation induces dopaminergic placebo effects, they also suggest the importance of placebo-controlled studies for future clinical trials involving brain stimulation techniques.

The present study examined the behavioral and neural bases of attending to one sense while ignoring another sense (bimodal selective attention) contrasted with attending simultaneously to two senses (bimodal divided attention). In a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study, subjects simultaneously heard novel melodies and viewed geometric shapes. They were instructed to actively attend to only one or to both senses (selective or divided attention) or as a baseline condition, passively observe both (bimodal passive). Memory tests for both attended and unattended stimuli validated that subjects were following the attention instructions. Selective attention led to increased activity in relevant sensory cortices while simultaneously leading to decreased activity in irrelevant sensory cortices. The divided attention instruction did not lead to a global increase in sensory cortex activity compared to the bimodal passive baseline condition. However, divided attention did recruit heteromodal areas in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, while selective attention did not recruit any frontal areas. We propose that sustained selective and divided bimodal attention were achieved via distinct neural processes. Selective attention was achieved primarily via modulation of the sensory cortices. Divided attention was achieved for most individuals via recruitment of the middle-dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. However, there was also a trade-off between activity in posterior-dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and sensory regions, such that individuals who demonstrated the best performance during divided attention also showed the greatest recruitment of sensory cortices.

To test the hypothesis that common mtDNA variation influences human physiology and disease, we identified all 144 variants with frequency > 1% in Europeans from > 900 publicly available European mtDNA sequences and selected 64 tagging single-nucleotide polymorphisms that efficiently capture all common variation ( except the hypervariable D-loop). Next, we evaluated the complete set of common mtDNA variants for association with type 2 diabetes in a sample of 3,304 diabetics and 3,304 matched nondiabetic individuals. Association of mtDNA variants with other metabolic traits ( body mass index, measures of insulin secretion and action, blood pressure, and cholesterol) was also tested in subsets of this sample. We did not find a significant association of common mtDNA variants with these metabolic phenotypes. Moreover, we failed to identify any physiological effect of alleles that were previously proposed to have been adaptive for energy metabolism in human evolution. More generally, this comprehensive association-testing framework can readily be applied to other diseases for which mitochondrial dysfunction has been implicated.

Interrater and intrarater reliability and score stability were tested using repeated administration of this test. The Functional Independence Measure and Modified Mini-Mental State Examination, as well as patient characteristics, were used to determine the validity of the assessment. One hundred and two persons with ingestive skill loss of neurologic origin were evaluated. Intraclass correlations for interrater, intrarater reliability and stability reached or surpassed 0.80 for most subscales. In validity testing, significant relationships were found between-Mental scores, as well as with patient McGill Ingestive scores and Functional Independence Measure and Mini characteristics. It is concluded that the McGill Ingestive Skills Assessment approaches or meets levels of reliability necessary for assessing patients and is valid for adults with neurogenic feeding difficulties residing in tertiary care facilities.

This study seeks to (a) compare Cognitive Behavioral Driver's Inventory (CBDI) scores for clients who passed and failed a driving evaluation and for diagnostic groups (left cerebrovascular accident [CVA], right CVA, traumatic brain injury [TBI], and cognitive decline); (b) determine sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of the CBDI; (c) compare validity of the CBDI with other tools; and (d) identity factors associated with outcome. PARTICIPANTS. This historical cohort study included clients with neurological conditions who completed a driving evaluation. MEASURES. CBDI, Motor-Free Visual Perception Test (MVPT), Bells test, and driving results were extracted from the charts. RESULTS. Mean CBDI (p < 0.0001) and MVPT (p < 0.0001) scores were significantly worse for those failing compared to passing the driving evaluation, Sensitivity of the CBDI was 62%, specificity was 81%, positive predictive values were 73%, and negative predictive values were 71%. Results varied according to diagnostic group. CONCLUSIONS. The CBDI is not sufficiently predictive of outcome to replace a driving evaluation, and is predictive only for clients with R-CVA and TBI. Evaluation of driving should vary according to diagnosis.

To determine off-road and on-road driving evaluation practices of clinicians in the United States and Canada who assess individuals with disabilities for fitness to drive. PARTICIPANTS. Participants were 114 clinician attendees at the 2003 annual Association of Driver Educators for the Disabled with driving assessment experience ranging from 1 month to 25 years. MEASURES. Information was elicited regarding the clinician, clientele, referral practices, and off-road and on-road driving evaluation practices and retraining practices using a self-administered questionnaire. RESULTS. Participants were largely occupational therapists (68%) who worked in 42 different states and provinces. The most prevalent clientele-were persons with traumatic brain injury (97%) and stroke (96%). Testing times greater than 60 min were common for both the off-road (61%) and on-road (49%) evaluations. Commonly performed off-road assessments included the Brake Reaction Timer; Trail Making Test, Parts A and B; and the Motor Free Visual Perception Test, used by 73%, 72%, and 66%, respectively; comprehensive computer-based driving evaluation was rare. Sixty-one percent indicated that all clients underwent on-road evaluation regardless of the off-road results. Finally, 78% used a standard driving route, whereas 24% used a scoring system to evaluate on-road driving. CONCLUSION. Driving assessment in Canada and the United States is multidimensional and time-intensive. Although the domains being assessed are similar across clincians, specific off-road and on-road assessment practices vary greatly. The majority use nonstandardized on-road assessments.

However, activation of neuronal beta-ARs on cardiac neurons may lead to further catecholamine release, with an attendant risk of functional deterioration. We hypothesize that a beneficial effect of beta-AR blockade may therefore mitigate excessive catecholamine release from cardiac adrenergic neurons in dogs with MR. We measured the effects of chronic beta-receptor blockade (beta-RB) on ISF NE and EP release using in vivo microdialysis in open-chest anesthetized dogs after 4 wk of MR with or without extended release of metoprolol succinate (100 mg/day) as well as in control dogs. Fractional shortening increased by 30% in both MR and MR + beta-RB dogs after 4 wk of MR. In MR + beta-RB dogs, stellate-stimulated heart rate change was attenuated compared with control and MR dogs, whereas peak change of LV pressure over time (+dP/dt) increased equally in all groups. Stellate-stimulated ISF NE increased fivefold over baseline in MR versus twofold in control dogs (< 0.05), but the NE release was significantly attenuated in MR + beta-RB dogs. In contrast, stellate-stimulated increases in ISF EP did not differ in control, MR, and MR + beta-RB dogs. This study demonstrates that beta-RB attenuates ISF NE release from cardiac neurons and that the LV functional response to MR is not dependent on an excess increase in ISF NE. Thus beta(1)-RB may exert a beneficial effect by attenuating untoward effects of excessive sympathetic efferent neural NE release while sustaining early LV functional adaptation to MR.

To combine molecular biology techniques with electrophysiological recording, we modified an organotypic culture protocol to permit transfection and whole cell patch-clamp recordings from SON cells. Neonatal mouse brain coronal sections containing the SON were dissected out, placed on a filter insert in culture medium, and incubated for at least 4 days to allow attachment to the insert. The SON was identifiable using gross anatomical landmarks, which remained intact throughout the culturing period. Immunohistochemical staining identified both vasopressinergic and oxytocinergic cells present in the cultures, typically appearing in well-defined clusters. Whole cell recordings from these cultures demonstrated that certain properties of the neonatal mouse SON were comparable to adult mouse magnocellular neurons. SON neurons in both neonatal cultures and acute adult slices showed similar sustained outward rectification above -60 mV and action potential broadening during evoked activity. Membrane potential, input resistance, and rapidly inactivating potassium current density (I-A) were reduced in the cultures, whereas whole cell capacitance and spontaneous synaptic excitation were increased, perhaps reflecting developmental changes in cell physiology that warrant further study. The use of the outlined organotypic culturing procedures will allow the study of such electrophysiological properties of mouse SON using whole cell patch-clamp, in addition to various molecular, techniques that require longer incubation times.

Evidence for the anti-inflammatory effects of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors within the central nervous system arose from studies demonstrating that statins improve clinical signs in the animal model of MS and reduce the number of gadolinium-enhancing lesions in MS. Methods: We sought to describe the impact of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor treatment on the physiology and immunology of human BBB-derived endothelial cells (ECs). Results: We demonstrate that lovastatin and simvastatin induce a 50 to 60% reduction in the diffusion rates of bovine serum albumin and [C-14] -sucrose across human BBB-ECs in vitro through abrogation of isoprenylation processes, but independent of the expression of the tight junction molecules occludin, VE-cadherin, JAM-1, zonula occluden-1, and zonula occluden-2. Simvastatin and lovastatin were equipotent in reducing BBB permeability in vitro, with median effective concentration (EC50) of 9.5 x 10(-8) and 1.0 x 10(-7)M, respectively. We further demonstrate that lovastatin and simvastatin treatment of BBB-ECs significantly restricts the migration of clinically isolated syndrome-derived and MS-derived monocytes and lymphocytes across the human BBB in vitro, through a specific reduction in the secretion of the chemokines monocyte chemotactic protein-1/CCL2 and interferon-gamma-inducible protein-10/CXCL10 by BBB-ECs. Interpretation: Our data parallel the previously reported magnetic resonance imaging-based radiological findings and suggest an effect of statins that could be beneficial in early MS, restricting the diffusion of molecular tracers and the migration of immune cells across the human BBB.

Processing of pericardial shed blood with a cell-saving device was claimed to prevent lipid micro-embolization and to protect from neurocognitive dysfunction after cardiopulmonary bypass. The present study tested the hypothesis that processing of pericardial shed blood with a cell-saving device during cardiopulmonary bypass would significantly decrease serum levels of protein S100B, and improve brain oxygen saturation and neurologic outcome, all markers of brain injury in elderly patients. Methods. Forty patients, 65 years of age and older, undergoing coronary artery bypass graft with cardiopulmonary bypass, were prospectively randomly assigned to processing of pericardial shed blood with a cell-saving device or to conventional use of a standard closed venous reservoir where cardiotomy blood was collected and einfused through the arterial circuit (control group). Serum in S100B was measured 30 minutes, 4 hours, 24 hours, and 48 hours after surgery. Near-infrared spectroscopy monitoring was performed during the procedure and the National Institutes of Health stroke scale was measured before surgery and at the time of discharge of the hospital. Results. Patients in the cell-saving device group averaged 72 +/- 3 years of age and underwent 3.1 +/- 0.7 coronary artery grafts with a mean of 62 +/- 20 minutes of cardiopulmonary bypass time. Patients in the control group averaged 75 +/- 4 years of age (p = 0.03) and underwent 3.3 +/- 0.6 coronary artery grafts (p = 0.49) with a mean of 75 +/- 25 minutes of cardiopulmonary bypass time (p = 0.12). The quantity of blood administered from the cell-saving device averaged 281 +/- 162 mL per patient. Serum protein S100B levels averaged 0.06 +/- 0.03 before surgery and 0.51 +/- 0.23 mu g/L 30 minutes after surgery in the cell-saving device patients compared with 0.076 +/- 0.04 before surgery (p = 0.32) and 1.48 +/- 0.66 (p < 0.0001) in the control patients. The near-infrared spectroscopy baseline mean value of left and right cortical region was 58% +/- 12% and 55% +/- 7% in the cell-saving device group versus 59% +/- 7% and 53% +/- 6% in the control group (p = 0.67 and 0.36), and no difference occurred over time in each group. The National Institutes of Health stroke score before and after surgery was similar in the two groups. There was one cerebrovascular complication in the control group (1 of 20, 5%) after surgery. Conclusions. The difference between the two groups occurred 30 minutes after surgery, at which time serum levels of protein S100B were significantly higher in the control group compared with cell-saving device patients. Although use of the cell-saving device was not associated with higher brain oxygen saturation nor changes in the National Institutes of Health stroke score, it is associated with lesser release of nonspecific markers of brain injury in elderly patients.

However, it is unknown if the cardioprotective effect of A(2A) adenosine receptor agonist, CGS211680, which reduces cytokine synthesis, would lead to such amygdala apoptosis regression. Thus, this study was designed to investigate whether cardioprotective A2A adenosine receptor activation reduces apoptosis in the amygdala following myocardial infarction. Anesthetized rats were subjected to left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion for 40 min, followed by 72 h of reperfusion. The A2A agonist CGS21680 (0.2 mu g/kg/min i.v.) was administered continuously for 120 min, starting (1) five minutes prior to instituting reperfusion (Early) or (2) five minutes after the beginning of reperfusion (Late). After reperfusion, myocardial infarct size was determined and the amygdala was dissected from the brain. Infarct size was reduced significantly in the Early compared to the Control group (34.6 +/- 1.8% and 52.3 +/- 2.8% respectively; p < 0.05), with no difference compared to the Late group (40.1 +/- 6.1%). Apoptosis regression was documented in the amygdala of the Early group by an enhanced phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-Akt pathway activation and Bcl-2 expression concurrently to a caspase-3 activation limitation and reduction in TUNEL-positive cells staining. On the other hand, amygdala TUNEL-positive cell numbers were not reduced in the Late group. Moreover, TNF alpha was significantly reduced in the amygdala of the Early group compared to the Control and Late groups. These results indicate that A(2A) adenosine receptor stimulation is associated with apoptosis regression in the amygdala following myocardial infarction.

Little is known about the neural circuitry that permits E. analoga to control the phase relationships between movements of the fourth legs and pair of uropods as it digs into sand, so mathematical models might aid in identifying features of the neural structures involved. The geometric arrangement of segmental ganglia controlling the movements of each limb provides an intuitive framework for modelling. Specifically, due to the rhythmic nature of movement, the network controlling the fourth legs and uropods is viewed as three coupled identical oscillators, one dedicated to the control of each fourth leg and one for the pair of uropods, which always move in bilateral synchrony. Systems of Morris-Lecar equations describe the voltage and ion channel dynamics of neurons. Each central pattern generator for a limb is first modelled as a single neuron and then, more realistically as a multi-neuron oscillator. This process results in high-dimensional systems of equations that are difficult to analyse. In either case, reduction to phase equations by averaging yields a two-dimensional system of equations where variables describe only each oscillator's phase along its limit cycle. The behaviour observed in the reduced equations approximates that of the original system. Results suggest that the phase response function in the two dimensional system, together with minimal input from asymmetric bilateral coupling parameters, is sufficient to account for the observed behaviour.

Their performance was compared with that of 8 autistics without a visuospatial peak (HFA-NP), 10 typically developing individuals (TD) and 8 gifted comparison participants with a visuospatial peak (TD-P). Both HFA-P and HFA-NP groups presented with diminished detrimental influence of increasing perceptual coherence compared with their BDT-matched comparison groups. Neither autistic group displayed a deficit in construction of global representations. The HFA-P group showed no differences in performance level or profile in comparison with the gifted BDT-matched [i.e. higher full-scale IQ (FSIQ)] group, apart from locally oriented perception. Diminished detrimental influence of perceptual coherence on BDT performance is both sensitive and specific to autism, and superior low-level processing interacts with locally oriented bias to produce outstanding BDT performance in a subgroup of autistic individuals. Locally oriented processing, enhanced performance in multiple tasks relying on detection of simple visual material and enhanced discrimination of first-order gratings converge towards an enhanced functioning and role of the primary visual cortex (V1) in autism. In contrast, superior or typical performance of autistics in tasks requiring global processing is inconsistent with the global-deficit-driven Weak Central Coherence hypothesis and its neurobiological magnocellular deficit counterpart.

J	Leh, SE; Johansen-Berg, H; Ptito, A				Leh, Sandra E.; Johansen-Berg, Heidi; Ptito, Alain			Unconscious vision: new insights into the neuronal correlate of blindsight using diffusion tractography	BRAIN			English	Article						blindsight; diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) tractography; superior colliculus; hemispherectomized subjects; brain plasticity	FRONTAL EYE-FIELD; RETINAL GANGLION-CELLS; SUPERIOR COLLICULUS; VISUAL PATHWAYS; HUMAN BRAIN; HEMIANOPIC FIELD; CONE OPPONENCY; TENSOR; HEMISPHERECTOMY; CONSCIOUSNESS	The existence of several types of unconscious vision, or 'blindsight', has convincingly been demonstrated in numerous studies, and their neuronal correlates have been hypothesized according to the nature of the residual vision observed. We used diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) tractography to demonstrate an association between the presence of 'Type I'- blindsight or 'attention blindsight' and reconstructed superior colliculi (SC) fibre tracts in hemispherectomized subjects, in support of the hypothesis that this subcortical structure plays a pivotal role in this type of blindsight. Before the DTI study, 'Type I' blindsight was identified in two of four hemispherectomized subjects by using a spatial summation effect paradigm, an indirect behavioural method, in which subjects were unaware of a stimulus presented in their blind visual field and were required to respond to an identical stimulus presented simultaneously in their intact field. SC tracts were then reconstructed in six control subjects, the two hemispherectomized subjects with blindsight and the two hemispherectomized subjects without blindsight. Whereas control subjects demonstrated mainly ipsilateral connections to visual association areas, parietal cortex, prefrontal areas and to an area close to the frontal eye fields, hemispherectomized subjects with blindsight showed ipsi- and contralateral connections from the SC to visual association areas, primary visual areas, parietal areas, prefrontal areas and to the posterior part of the internal capsule. In contrast, no projections from the SC on the hemispherectomized side were observed in hemispherectomized subjects without blindsight, in support of a key role of this structure in 'Type-I' or 'attention blindsight'.

Research design: Retrospective database review. Methods and procedures: Scores on the Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOSE) and on the FIM (TM) instrument,(1) discharge destination and length-of-stay (LOS) were gathered and compared for 2327 patients with TBI admitted to a level 1 trauma hospital from 1997-2003 divided into three age groups; 971 patients between 18-39 years, 672 between 40-59 years and 684 aged 60-99 years. Main outcomes and results: Relative to younger adults with similar TBI severity, elderly patients showed worse outcome on the GOSE and FIM (TM) instrument (physical and cognitive ratings) and longer LOS. No difference was observed between the young and middle-aged groups except for cognitive FIM (TM) ratings and LOS for severe TBI. A higher percentage of elderly patients went to in-patient rehabilitation, to long-term care facilities or died compared to young and middle-aged patients. A higher number of young and middle-aged patients were discharged home. Conclusions: Further development of services in early rehabilitation as well as post-rehabilitation geared to the specific needs of the elderly patient with TBI is required as the population ages.

Megaloblastic anaemia, pancytopenia and failure to thrive can be present, accompanied by neurological deficits if the diagnosis is delayed. Most cases of spina bifida and other neural tube defects result from maternal folate and/or cobalamin insufficiency in the periconceptual period. Polymorphisms in a number of genes involved in folate and cobalamin metabolism exacerbate the risk. Inborn errors of cobalamin metabolism affect its absorption, (intrinsic factor deficiency, Imerslund-Grasbeck syndrome) and transport (transcobalamin deficiency) as well as its intracellular metabolism affecting adenosylcobalamin synthesis (cblA and cblB), methionine synthase function (cblE and cblG) or both (cblC, cblD and cblF). Inborn errors of folate metabolism include congenital folate malabsorption, severe methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase deficiency and formiminotransferase deficiency. The identification of disease-causing mutations in specific genes has improved our ability to diagnose many of these conditions, both before and after birth.

Methods: A retrospective chart review of all acute care, in-hospital deaths in Quebec in the year 2000 was undertaken. Hospital record librarians provided statistics and completed questionnaires on each chart after applying exclusion and inclusion criteria. Results: There were 24,702 acute care in-hospital deaths reported by 83 hospitals participating in the study on a voluntary basis. Analyzing 2,067 files meeting inclusion criteria, we identified 348 potential OD (1.4% of deaths). In hospitals not providing tertiary adult trauma care, the potential donor rate was 0.99% of all deaths. There were 4.5 times more potential donors in tertiary care adult trauma centers. Brain death was formally diagnosed in 268/348 patients, and organ donation discussed as an option with 230/268 families. Consent for donation was given in 70% of cases, although not all these patients proved to be suitable after evaluation. There were 125 actual donors in Quebec in the year 2000 (18 per million population). Conclusions: The gap between used and potential donors can be explained by several factors including failure to approach families for organ donation, family refusal, incomplete neurological assessment of patients, and medical unsuitability of some consented donors. There is room for improvement in the identification of potential donors and in the presentation of organ donation as an end of life option to families.

Patients transferred to ONCs from community hospitals with acute intracranial emergencies often have non-survivable injuries, and may be returned to the referring hospital for end-of-life care. These referring hospitals may not be familiar with neurological determination of death, or organ donation. Our objective was to determine the number of patients with severe brain injuries assessed in ONC emergency departments where progression to brain death may be reasonably expected, and to determine their outcome. Methods: A one-year retrospective cohort study was undertaken using a convenience sample of patients transferred to eight ONCs for neurosurgical assessment, with evidence of either (a) brain death in the emergency department, or (b) severe brain injury who met criteria of a reasonable likelihood of progression to brain death. The outcome of these patients to disposition from the ONC was determined by chart review. Results: Three thousand four hundred and forty-seven patients were identified of whom 141 met inclusion criteria. Eleven patients (7.8%) were pronounced dead in the emergency department, 96 (68.1%) patients were admitted, and 34 (24.1%) were transferred back to their referring hospital. Fourteen patients (9.9%) became organ donors: two died in the emergency department and 12 died following admission. Conclusions: A significant number of patients transferred to ONCs have an injury with a likelihood of progressing to brain death, but only a small proportion of these patients become organ donors. Emergency department triage, assessment and admission decisions for patients with intracranial catastrophes should consider diagnostic criteria for brain death and recognition of donor potential as part of end-of-life care.

The increased expression of Gi alpha and blood pressure was restored toward WKY levels by captopril treatment, suggesting a role for angiotensin (Ang) II in the enhanced expression of Gia protein and blood pressure. This study was undertaken to investigate whether 1 kidney 1 clip (1K-1C) hypertensive rats that exhibit enhanced levels of Ang II also express enhanced levels of Gia proteins. Aortas from 1K-1C hypertensive rats were used. The expression of G-proteins was determined at protein levels with immunoblotting techniques, using specific antibodies for different isoforms of G-proteins. The levels of Gi alpha-2 and Gi alpha-3 proteins were significantly higher in aortas from 1K-1C hypertensive rats than in control rats; Gsa levels were unchanged. The inhibitory effect of low concentrations of guanosine 5'-[gamma-thio]-triphosphate (GTP gamma S) on forskolin (FSK)-stimulated adenylyl cyclase (AC) activity was significantly enhanced in aortas from 1K-1C hypertensive rats; the inhibitory effect of C-ANP(4-23), which specifically interacts with the atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP)-C receptor, and Ang II on AC was attenuated. GTPgS, isoproterenol, glucagon, NaF, and FSK stimulated the AC activity in aortas from control and hypertensive rats to varying degrees; however, the stimulations were significantly lower in hypertensive rats than in control rats. These data suggest that aortas from 1K-1C hypertensive rats exhibit enhanced expression of Gia proteins and associated functions.

Among these PTPs, RPTP sigma is expressed in relatively high levels in insulin- target tissues. We show that RPTPs sigma(-/-) knockout mice have reduced plasma glucose and insulin concentrations in the fasted state compared with their wild-type siblings. The knockout animals were also more sensitive to exogenous insulin as assayed by insulin-tolerance tests. Despite increased whole-body insulin sensitivity, tyrosine phosphorylation of the IR was not increased in muscle of RPTP sigma(-/-) animals, as would be expected in insulin-sensitive animals. Instead, the levels of IR tyrosine phosphorylation and PI3-kinase activity were reduced in the muscle of knockout animals stimulated with insulin in vivo. However, insulin- stimulated Akt serine phosphorylation was essentially identical between both groups of mice. Accordingly, muscles isolated from RPTP sigma(-/-) mice did not have a significant increase in glucose uptake in response to insulin, suggesting that RPTPs did not play a direct role in this process. Taken together, our results suggest an indirect modulation of the IR signaling pathways by RPTP sigma(-/-). Since low dose injection of growth hormone (GH) normalized the response to exogenous insulin in RPTP sigma(-/-) mice, we propose that the insulin hypersensitivity observed in RPTP sigma(-/-) mice is secondary to their neuroendocrine dysplasia and GH/IGF-1 deficiency.

Quetiapine shares crucial pharmacological properties with clozapine. Promising results have been described with quetiapine therapy in patients with psychosis and substance use disorder. Methods: Based on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-fourth edition (DSM-IV) criteria, patients were diagnosed with comorbid schizophrenia-spectrum and substance use disorders. Patients were switched to quetiapine for a 12-week open-label trial. Craving, quantities used, days of consumption, and severity of substance abuse were assessed every 3 weeks. Alcohol and Drug Use Scales were administered on baseline and end-point. Psychiatric symptoms, depressive symptoms, extrapyramidal symptoms, and cognition were also assessed at baseline, week 6 and week 12. Results: Twenty-four schizophrenia-spectrum patients were included in the last observation carried forward (LOCF) analyses, responding to one or more of the following substance use disorders: cannabis ( 15 patients), alcohol ( 10 patients), and other psychoactive substances ( nine patients). Overall, severity of substance abuse improved during the study. Less weekly days were spent on drugs of abuse. A decrease in the weekly Canadian dollars spent on psychoactive substances was also observed. Cognition, psychiatric, depressive, and extrapyramidal symptoms also significantly improved ( p < 0.05). Conclusions: In this open-label, uncontrolled trial, significant improvements were noted in substance abuse, psychiatric symptoms, extrapyramidal symptoms, and cognition during quetiapine therapy. The study suffered from three main limitations: ( 1) the open-label design of the study; ( 2) the patients' poor compliance; and ( 3) the small sample size involved. Controlled studies on the use of quetiapine in dual diagnosis schizophrenia are warranted to confirm that the effects are drug-related.

The main variables that explain variation in the pattern of human mastication are the subjects themselves, their age, the type of food being eaten, and time during a sequence of movements. The intrinsic pattern of mastication is generated by a central pattern generator (CPG) located in the pons and medulla. The output of the CPG is modified by inputs that descend from higher centers of the brain and by feedback from sensory receptors. Intraoral touch receptors, muscle spindles in the jaw-closing muscles, and specialized mechanoreceptors in the periodontal ligament have especially powerful effects on movement parameters.

Images were acquired before (background) and during electrical stimulation with a temporal resolution of 10 images/s and were displayed in pseudocolors. Extracellular stimuli (200 mu s; < 4 V) were delivered through bipolar stainless steel electrodes placed in the white matter. Results: IOSs recorded in NEC slices bathed in control aCSF became less intense and of reduced size with age (p < 0.05); this trend was not seen in WAG/Rij slices. Age-dependent decreases in IOS intensity and area size were also seen in NEC slices superfused with aCSF containing the convulsant 4-aminopyridine (4-AP, 5 mu M); in contrast, significant increases in both parameters occurred with age in 4-AP-treated WAG/Rij slices (p < 0.05). Under any of these conditions, the IOS intensity and area size slices were larger in WAG/Rij than in NEC slices. LEV (50-500 mu M) application to WAG/Rij slices caused dose-dependent IOS reductions that were evident both in control and in 4-AP-containing aCSF and were more pronounced in 6-month-old tissue. Conclusions: These data demonstrate age-dependent IOS modifications in NEC and WAG/Rij rat slices and identify a clear pattern of hyperexcitability that occurs in 6-month-old WAG/Rij neocortical tissue, an age when absence seizures occur in all animals. The ability of LEV to reduce these patterns of network hyperexcitability supports the potential use of this new antiepileptic drug in primary generalized epileptic disorders.

It has been shown in a variety of systems that if reactivation induces significant extinction then extinction is the protein synthesis dependent memory state, rather than reconsolidation. Thus, extinction consolidation may prevent the memory from undergoing reconsolidation. We investigated whether such an interaction also exists between extinction and reconsolidation of fear memories within the amygdala, by using a within subjects experimental design. We found that inhibition of protein synthesis in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) impaired reconsolidation for both the briefly reactivated and extinguished fear memories suggesting that extinction is not a sufficient condition to prevent induction of reconsolidation in the amygdala. These findings demonstrate that extinction consolidation does not always interact with reconsolidation. Therefore, under these conditions, extinction is not a boundary condition on reconsolidation of fear memories in the basolateral amygdala.

Accumulating data from clinical studies and a growing body of clinical experience suggest that botulinum toxin A (BoNTA) may be an appropriate treatment, particularly in patients in whom the efficacy or tolerability of anticholinergics is in doubt. This supplement supplies a rationale for the use of BoNTA in OAB, discussing its mechanism of action and presenting data on its efficacy and safety in patients with neurogenic detrusor overactivity (NDO) and idiopathic detrusor overactivity. It also considers NDO in the context of other disorders from which these patients may suffer. (c) 2006 European Association of Urology. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Young, A				Young, Allan			Bruno and the Holy Fool : Myth, Mimesis and the transmission of traumatic memories	EVOLUTION PSYCHIATRIQUE			French	Article						memory; trauma; PTSD; anthropology; Shoah; lies	GERMANY; WAR; NEUROSIS; WEIMAR	Interest in PTSD and traumatic memory extends beyond psychiatry. Over the last two decades, "trauma theory" has emerged as an influential discourse within the humanities and social sciences. The theory is based on an unlikely combination of sources: Freud's accounts of traumatic neurosis in Beyond the Pleasure Principle and Moses and Monotheism; Bessel van der Kolk's research into the neurophysiology of PTSD and somatic memory; and post-modern writing on collective memory. Trauma theory writers are intensely interested in explaining how traumatic memories are transmitted between and within generations. Explanations focus on the roles of contagion as a mode of transmission and the Holocaust as a shared collective trauma. This chapter argues that the clinical and cultural phenomena that are being explained by these writers are better understood in terms of mimesis or imitation. The argument is illustrated with the help of a fraudulent Holocaust 'memoir' by Benjamin Wilkomirski, and an analysis of audience responses once the fraud was exposed. This chapter underlines important concerns regarding the clinical epistemology of posttraumatic stress disorder. (c) 2006 Elsevier Masson SAS. Tous droits reserves.

The program quantified performance in terms of speed and accuracy on four major constructs: (1) planning ( a 30-item office party script); (2) prospective memory ( injections, sleep, phone); (3) working memory (PASAT, D2, and CES analogs); and (4) retrospective memory. Participants had to organize an office party, self inject insulin and go to bed at requisite times of day, do "office work'' at unpredictable times of day, and answer the phone that blinked but did not ring ( near threshold stimulus). The elderly were markedly and equally impaired on all four constructs (F = 24.3, p < .000). The elderly were also equally and markedly impaired on slave and central executive systems (c.f. Baddeley's model) and on event-based and time-based prospective memory (c.f. McDaniel's model) - findings arguing against a "frontal'' model of cognitive decline. This supports Salthouse's concept of a "general factors'' decline in normal aging due to diffuse deterioration of the brain. On the other hand, as expected from previous findings, the balance of omissiveness/commissiveness was significantly increased in the elderly sample's error profile. Furthermore, the balance of speed and accuracy was significantly increased in the elderly. This defines limits of the `` general factors'' model. The elderly also markedly underused a clock icon which had to be clicked on to get the virtual time of day necessary for integrating all the required actions. Prospective memory explained 11% of the aging variance despite partialing out of the three other constructs, making it appear as a golden standard of sensititivity to normal aging though perhaps provided it be implemented in a distracting, multitask, strategically demanding context.

While behavioral studies have indeed supported the role of PMLS cortex in higher order motion integration (Cereb Cortex 6:814-822, 1996), there is no evidence that individual PMLS cells can perform such analysis (Vis Neurosci 5:463-468, 1990; J Neurophysiol 63:1529-1543, 1990). Given the fundamental importance of understanding the neural substrate subtending higher order motion processing, we investigated whether PMLS neurons can signal the direction of motion of complex random dot kinematograms (RDKs) wherein comprising elements do not provide any local coherent motion cues. Results indicated that most PMLS cells (82%) can integrate the displacement of individual elements into a global motion percept. Their large receptive fields allowed the integration of motion for elements separated by large spatial intervals (up to 4 degrees). In most cases, the analysis of complex RDK motion necessitated the contribution of the area of the visual field beyond the classical receptive field. None of the complex RDK-sensitive cells were found to be pattern-motion selective when tested with plaid patterns. Our results provide the first evidence that receptive fields of PMLS neurons can perform global motion analysis and support the behavioral evidence that this area is implicated in complex motion processing (Cereb Cortex 6:814-822, 1996). It also further corroborates the findings that PMLS neurons cannot signal the true direction of a plaid pattern (Vis Neurosci 5:463-468, 1990; J Neurophysiol 63:1529-1543, 1990). Providing that these same neurons can signal the direction of complex RDKs, there may be distinct cortical mechanisms for processing different types of complex motion.

J	Abdouh, M; Bernier, G				Abdouh, Mohamed; Bernier, Gilbert			In vivo reactivation of a quiescent cell population located in the ocular ciliary body of adult mammals	EXPERIMENTAL EYE RESEARCH			English	Article						ciliary body; iris; stem cells; adult mammals; in vivo activation; growth factors	PHOTORECEPTOR-SPECIFIC PHENOTYPES; RETINAL STEM-CELLS; GENE-EXPRESSION; REGENERATION; PROGENITORS; IDENTIFICATION; GANGLION; TISSUE; BRAIN; CHX10	Rare quiescent cells with stem cell characteristics have been isolated from the ocular ciliary body (CB) of adult mammals. In vitro, adult retinal stem cells were reported to generate sphere colonies containing multipotent retinal progenitor cells. Whether proliferation of this stem cell population can be stimulated in vivo in order to generate new retinal cells is an important issue. Herein we report on the in vivo reactivation of a quiescent cell population present in the CB upon growth factors (GF) stimulation. GF stimulation resulted in the re-acquisition of embryonic characteristics (Nestin) and expression of the cell cycle entry markers CyclinD1 and Ki67 by a subset of CB epithelial cells. This inductive effect was not observed in the neural retina. GF-activated CB epithelial cells co-express the retinal progenitor homeodomain transcription factors Pax6 and Chx10. Serial GF injections led to do novo proliferation of clusters of cells in the CB, in a dose-dependent manner, as revealed by bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation. Analysis of cells' BrdU content within individual clusters suggests a mode of cell division that is predominantly asymmetric. Cell proliferation was not induced by CB or retinal damage, as indicated by the absence of TUNEL-labeled cells. Newly produced cells did not migrate into the retina nor did they differentiate into retinal neurons. This study demonstrates that proliferation of a quiescent cell population with retinal stem/progenitor cell characteristics can be reactivated in vivo upon GF injections and suggests that, in adult mammals, the CB is a non-permissive environment for cell migration and neurogenesis.

Functional expression of "cardiac-type" Na(v)1.5 sodium channel in canine intracardiac ganglia	HEART RHYTHM			English	Article						SCN5A; tetrodotoxin; autonomic dysfunction; cardiac arrhythmia; sudden cardiac death; long QT syndrome; Brugada syndrome	LONG-QT SYNDROME; SKELETAL-MUSCLE; NA+ CHANNELS; BRUGADA-SYNDROME; SENSORY NEURONS; ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL PROPERTIES; NEUROBLASTOMA-CELLS; BRAIN; HEART; LOCALIZATION	Background The autonomic nervous system has been implicated in several arrhythmogenic diseases, including Long QT syndrome type 3 (LQT3) and Brugada syndrome. Scarce information on the cellular components of the intrinsic cardiac ganglia from higher mammals has Limited our understanding of the role of the autonomic nervous system in such diseases. Objectives The purpose of this study was to isolate and characterize the electrophysiologic properties of canine intracardiac neurons. Methods Action potentials (APs) and ionic currents were studied in enzymatically dissociated canine intracardiac neurons under current and voltage clamp conditions. Immunohistochemical and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis was performed using freshly isolated intracardiac ganglia. Results APs recorded from intracardiac neurons displayed a tetrodotoxin-resistant (TTX-R) component. TTX-R APs were abolished in the absence of sodium but persisted in the absence of external calcium. Immunohistochemical studies showed the presence of TTX-R sodium channels in these ganglia. Sodium currents were characterized by two components with different affinities for TTX: a tetrodotoxin-sensitive (TTX-S) component and a TTX-R component. TTX-S current inactivation was characteristic of neuronal sodium currents, whereas TTX-R current inactivation time constants were similar to those previously reported for Na(v)1.5 channels. TTX sensitivity (IC50=1.17 mu M) of the TTX-R component was in the range reported for Na(v)1.5 channels. Expression of Na(v)1.5 channels in intracardiac ganglia was confirmed by PCR analysis and sequencing. Conclusion Our results suggest that canine intracardiac neurons functionally express Na(v)1.5 channels. These findings open an exciting new door to our understanding of autonomically modulated arrhythmogenic diseases linked to mutations in Na(v)1.5 channels, including Brugada syndrome and LQT3.

Basic emotions are associated with distinct patterns of cardiorespiratory activity	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						basic emotion; autonomic nervous system; heart rate variability; respiratory sinus arrhythmia; respiration	HEART-RATE-VARIABILITY; AUTONOMIC NERVOUS-SYSTEM; RESPIRATORY SINUS ARRHYTHMIA; RATE TIME-SERIES; INTEROCEPTIVE AWARENESS; FRACTAL DIMENSION; NEURAL REGULATION; SPECTRAL-ANALYSIS; PANIC DISORDER; BRAIN ACTIVITY	The existence of specific somatic states associated with different emotions remains controversial. In this study, we investigated the profile of cardiorespiratory activity during the experience of fear, anger, sadness and happiness. ECG and respiratory activity was recorded in 43 healthy volunteers during the recall and experiential reliving of one or two potent emotional autobiographical episodes and a neutral episode. Univariate statistics indicated that the four emotions differed from each other and from the neutral control condition on several linear and spectral indices of cardiorespiratory activity. Dependent variables were further reduced to five physiologically meaningful factors using an exploratory principal component analysis (PCA). Multivariate analyses of variance and effect size estimates calculated on those factors confirmed the differences between the four emotion conditions. A stepwise discriminant analyses predicting emotions using the PCA factors led to a classification rate of 65.3% for the four emotions (chance=25%; p=0.001) and of 72.0-83.3% for pair-wise discrimination (chance=50%; p's < 0.05). These findings may be considered preliminary in view of the small sample on which the multivariate approach has been applied. However, this study emphasizes the need to better characterize the multidimensional factors involved in cardio-respiratory regulation during emotion. These results are consistent with the notion that distinct patterns of peripheral physiological activity are associated with different emotions. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, its role in neuropathic pain is not established. Following nerve injury, CGRP and pro-inflammatory interleukin-6 (IL-6) are increased in injured nerves. The aim of this study was to determine if CGRP in injured nerves is involved in the up-regulation of IL-6 and in the maintenance of neuropathic pain. Perineural injection of a neutralizing IL-6 antiserum or CGRP receptor antagonists (CGRP8-37 and BIBN4096BS) effectively attenuated thermal hyperalgesia 4 weeks after partial sciatic nerve ligation. Perineural CGRP antagonists also dramatically reduced IL-6 level in injured nerves. CGRP release from injured sites was dramatically increased and CGRP immunoreactivity was localized in both neuroma and invading macrophages. CGRP receptor markers (CRLR and RAMP1) were expressed in invading macrophages. Both CGRP antagonists significantly reduced IL-6 release from injured nerve explants. In cell cultures derived from injured nerves, CGRP concentration-dependently increased IL-6 release, an effect also blocked by CGRP antagonists. Taken together, these data show that increased levels of CGRP in injured neuroma and invading macrophages are involved in the up-regulation of IL-6 in macrophages as well as in the maintenance of neuropathic pain.

Although these disorders differ in important ways, they also have common pathogenic features, including inflammation, genetic mutations, inappropriate protein aggregates (e.g., Lewy bodies, amyloid plaques), and biochemical defects leading to apoptosis, such as oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. In most disorders, it remains uncertain whether inflammation and protein aggregation are neurotoxic or neuroprotective. Elucidating the mechanisms that orchestrate neuronal diseases should facilitate development of neuroprotective and neurorestorative strategies.

Because low folate and absent MTHFR activity were shown to affect proliferation and apoptosis in developing neural tissue, we examined these processes in the myocardium of embryos from Mthfr +/+ and Mthfr +/- mice fed control diets (CD) or folic acid-deficient diets (FADD). Mice consumed the designated diets for 8 wk, from weaning and through pregnancy until they were killed. Embryos were assessed on gestational day 12.5 for myocardial proliferation by 5-bromo-2 '-deoxyuridine (BrdU) labeling and for apoptosis by TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labeling staining and caspase 3/7 activity assays. FADD-treated dams had significantly higher resorption rates than CD-treated dams. Embryonic lengths and weights from FADD-treated dams were significantly lower than those from CD-treated dams; the smallest embryos were those of the Mthfr +/- dams that consumed the FADD, with effect of genotype tending to be significant (P = 0.09). The thickness of cardiac ventricular compact walls of embryos from FADD-treated dams was significantly reduced, and embryonic myocardium from FADD-treated dams had significantly fewer BrdU-labeled cells compared with CD-treated dams, with no differences in apoptosis due to the diets. Genotype did not affect proliferation or apoptosis. Our results suggest that proliferation of embryonic myocardium is sensitive to maternal dietary folate and that folate supplementation during pregnancy is important for normal heart development and prevention of heart defects.

Early involvement by a multidisciplinary team of physicians, nurses, dieticians, occupational and speech therapists, psychologists, and social workers is essential to prevent the adverse outcomes associated with feeding difficulties and poor nutritional status. Careful evaluation and monitoring of severely disabled children for nutritional problems are warranted because of the increased risk of nutrition-related morbidity and mortality.

Methods: The WeeFIM was administered to patients with surgical cerebral palsy at defined intervals preoperatively and at both 6 and 12 months postoperatively. The age-adjusted change scores from baseline to follow-up were tested both parametrically and nonparametrically. Results: Four hundred sixty-eight patients had baseline evaluations. There were 161 six-month follow-up assessments and 108 twelve-month follow-up assessments. The baseline WeeFIM was able to separate children with different patterns of cerebral palsy. Hemiplegic patients had higher scores than diplegic and tetraplegic patients. Overall age-adjusted scores were improved at both 6 (mean increase 2.0) and 12 months (rnean increase 2.2). The instrument showed significant ceiling effects for diplegic and hemiplegic patients with lower or upper extremity surgery and limited responsiveness for lower extremity surgery in tetraplegic patients. Parametrically, it showed improvements in mobility for both rhizotomy and tetraplegic upper extremity surgery. Nonparametric tests were not significant for rhizotomy mobility improvement. Conclusions: Although the WeeFIM adequately reflects the severity of neurological involvement in pediatric orthopaedic patients with cerebral palsy, it has a significant ceiling effect in diplegic and hemiplegic patients limiting responsiveness and lacks content validity for tetraplegic patients. The instrument may have some use in tetraplegic patients with upper extremity surgery and in rhizotomy patients. We recommend against its general use for orthopaedic surgery in patients with cerebral palsy lower extremity or spine surgery and in hemiplegic patients with upper extremity surgery.

A major improvement would be to link therapeutic drugs to the SPIONs to achieve targeted drug delivery, either at the cell surface or intracellularly, together with active disease detection, without inducing cell reaction. Our objectives were to define the characteristics of SPIONS able to achieve cell-specific interaction with brain-derived structures. Our system consisted in an iron oxide core (9-10 nm diameter) coated either with dextran (Sinerem and Endorem) or various functionalized polyvinyl alcohols (PVAs) (PVA-SPIONs). We investigated the cellular uptake, cytotoxicity, and interaction of these various nanoparticles with brain-derived endothelial cells, microglial cells, and differentiating three-dimensional aggregates. None of the nanoparticles coated with dextran or the various PVAs was cytotoxic or induced the production of the inflammatory mediator NO used as a reporter for cell activation. AminoPVA-SPIONs were taken up by isolated brain-derived endothelial and microglial cells at a much higher level than the other SPIONs, and no inflammatory activation of these cells was observed. AminoPVA-SPIONs did not invade brain cells aggregates lower than the first cell layer and did not induce inflammatory reaction in the aggregates. Fluorescent aminoPVA-SPIONs derivatized with a fluorescent reporter molecule and confocal microscopy demonstrated intracellular uptake by microglial cells. Fluorescent aminoPVA-SPIONs were well tolerated by mice. Therefore, functionalized aminoPVA-SPIONs represent biocompatible potential vector systems for drug delivery to the brain that may be combined with MRI detection of active lesions in neurodegenerative diseases.

Specific [H-3] resveratrol binding sites were found to be enriched in the plasma membrane pellet with lower levels in the nuclear and cell debris fraction. Specific [H-3] resveratrol binding to the plasma membrane fraction was sensitive to trypsin digestion and protein denaturation but not to DNase and RNase treatment. Saturation binding experiments revealed that specific [H-3] resveratrol recognized a single class of sites with an apparent affinity (K-D) of 220 +/- 45 nM and a maximal capacity (B-max) of 1060 +/- 120 fmol/mg protein. Various polyphenols and resveratrol derivatives competed against specific [H-3] resveratrol binding in rat brain plasma membrane homogenates with the tea catechin gallates (epigallocatechin gallate and epicatechin gallate) displaying the highest affinities (K-i = 25-45 nM) followed by resveratrol (K-i = 102 nM). Quantitative autoradiographic studies revealed that specific [H-3] resveratrol binding sites are broadly distributed in the rat brain, with highest levels of labeling seen in the choroid plexus and subfornical organ. Finally, the potency of various polyphenols and resveratrol analogs in protecting hippocampal cells against beta-amyloid-induced toxicity correlated well (r = 0.74) with their apparent affinity in the [H-3] resveratrol binding assay. Taken together, these results suggest that the neuroprotective action of various polyphenols and resveratrol analogs could be mediated by the activation of common "receptor" binding sites particularly enriched at the level of the cellular plasma membrane in the rat brain.

However, the effect of denervation on the permeability transition pore (PTP), a mitochondrial protein complex implicated in cell death, is uncertain. In the present study, the impact of 21 days of denervation on the sensitivity of the PTP to Ca2+-induced opening was studied in isolated muscle mitochondria. Muscle denervation increased the sensitivity to Ca2+-induced opening of the PTP, as indicated by a significant decrease in calcium retention capacity (CRC: 111 +/- 12 versus 475 +/- 33 nmol (mg protein)(-1) for denervated and sham, respectively). This phenomenon was partly attributable to in vivo mitochondrial and whole muscle Ca2+ overload. Cyclosporin A, which inhibits PTP opening by binding to cyclophilin D (CypD), was significantly more potent in mitochondria from denervated muscle and restored CRC to the level observed in mitochondria from sham-operated muscles. In contrast, the CypD independent inhibitor trifluoperazine was equally effective at inhibiting PTP opening in sham and denervated animals and did not correct the difference in CRC between groups. This phenomenon was associated with a significant increase in the content of the PTP regulating protein CypD relative to several mitochondrial marker proteins. Together, these results indicate that Ca2+ overload in vivo and an altered expression of CypD could predispose mitochondria to permeability transition in denervated muscles.

Although it is widely distributed in the central and peripheral nervous systems, neurotensin has been more intensely studied with regard to its interactions with the central dopamine system. A number of claims have been made regarding its possible implication in many diseases of the central nervous system, including schizophrenia. In this review, we describe briefly the basic biology of this neuropeptide, and then we consider the strengths and the weaknesses of the data that suggest a role for neurotensin in schizophrenia, drug abuse, Parkinson's disease, pain, central control of blood pressure, eating disorders, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders and inflammation.

Methods: We conducted a double-blind crossover study, in which participants took tryptophan (3g/d) and placebo for 15 days each and recorded how they behaved, felt and perceived others during everyday social interactions. Results: Tryptophan significantly decreased quarrelsome behaviours and increased agreeable behaviours and perceptions of agreeableness. Men also behaved less dominantly, whereas both men and women perceived others as more dominant. Conclusion: Tryptophan's effects on behaviours and perceptions, while more marked in the men, were generally positive and accompanied by improved affect. Increasing serotonin in quarrelsome people may not only reduce behaviours associated with a predisposition to various mental and physical disorders but also enhance socially constructive behaviours and improve social perceptions.

Methods: We carried out a double-blind, parallel group study (n = 19/arm) with balanced randomization in blocks of 4 and stratification by sex. Subjects entered a 30-week trial, of which phases I-III were open: phase I (wk 0-6) baseline; phase II (wk 7-9) stepwise transition to haloperidol (HAL), 30 mg/d, plus benztropine (BT), 4 mg/d; phase III (wk 10-15) HAL, 40-60 mg/d, plus BT, 4-6 mg/d; phase IV (wk 16-20) stepwise transition to LMP or CPZ (500 mg/d) following randomization; phase V (wk 21-28) stepwise increase of LMP or CPZ (600-1000 mg/d, dose reduction permitted) to establish optimum dose; and phase VI (wk 29-30) optimized dose maintained. Criteria for TRS were based on those established by Kane et al in 1988. The criterion for a response to treatment was a reduction of 25% or more in total Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale score. Results: Both LMP (p = 0.007) and CPZ (p = 0.030) improved TRS relative to baseline. Although there was no significant difference between the 2 groups in treatment response at study end point, hierarchical linear modelling of longitudinal outcome revealed a significant (p = 0.006) advantage of LMP over CPZ for the BPRS total score. Ten of 19 participants on LMP and 8 of 19 on CPZ met the criterion for treatment response, and 9 of the 18 responders did so on 200-700 mg/d phenothiazine. The mean dose of responders was 710 (standard deviation [SD] 265) mg/d (LMP) and 722 (SD 272) mg/d (CPZ). Akathisia was associated with a nonresponse to phenothiazines ( p= 0.010). BPRS scores increased significantly on HAL (p = 0.006). Two of 19 participants on LMP and 5 of 19 on CPZ withdrew early from the study. Conclusion: LMP and CPZ may be useful in the management of TRS. A modest advantage of LMP compared with CPZ was seen in longitudinal analysis. High doses of neuroleptics may contribute to TRS; reduction of neuroleptics to modest or moderate doses should be considered before categorizing a patient as treatment resistant.

Here, we show that Neuropilin-1 (NRP1), the receptor for semaphorin-3A and VEGF-A165 and a member of the immune synapse, is also a physical and functional partner of HTLV-1 envelope (Env) proteins. HTLV-1 Env and NRP1 complexes are formed in cotransfected cells, and endogenous NRP1 contributes to the binding of HTLV-1 Env to target cells. NRP1 overexpression increases HTLV-1 Env-dependent syncytium formation. Moreover, overexpression of NRP1 increases both HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 Env-dependent infection, whereas down-regulation of endogenous NRP1 has the opposite effect. Finally, overexpressed GLUT1, NRP1, and Env form ternary complexes in transfected cells, and endogenous NRP1 and GLUT1 colocalize in membrane junctions formed between uninfected and HTLV-1-infected T cells. These data show that NRP1 is involved in HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 entry, suggesting that the HTLV receptor has a multicomponent nature.

Hence, the ability to detect light touch does not depend entirely on the A-beta somatosensory system; CT afferents may contribute to the detection of weak monofilaments.

Rats that were water deprived during training, then salt + water deprived during testing, spent more time in their salt-paired compartments, a salt latent cue preference (LCP). Rats that were water-only deprived during training and testing spent more time in their water-paired compartments, a water CCP. Rats that were salt + water deprived during both training and testing spent more time in their salt-paired compartments, a salt CCP. Bilateral, pre-training lesions of the lateral amygdala impaired the water and salt CCPs but not the salt LCP, reflecting the role of the amygdala in Pavlovian conditioning. Lesions of the dorsal or ventral hippocampus impaired the salt LCP and the water and salt CCPs, possibly reflecting the role of the hippocampus in contextual learning. Lesions of the fimbria-fornix impaired the water and salt CCPs but not the salt LCP. while lesions of the entorhinal cortex impaired the salt LCP but not the CCPs. This suggests that the LCP depends on a circuit that includes dorsal and ventral hippocampus and entorhinal cortex, a major conduit of sensory information from the cortex. In contrast, the CCPs depend on the amygdala and a circuit that includes the hippocampus and fimbria-fornix, possibly as a conduit of motivational information from subcortical structures.

In Rora(sg) cerebellum, 5HT concentrations increased relative to controls, while tryptophan concentrations decreased. 5HIAA concentrations increased in mutant cerebellum and brainstem, but the 5HIAA/5HT ratio declined only in cerebellum. These results indicate that 5HT turnover decreased in cerebellum of an ataxic mutant, perhaps indicative of presynaptic accumulation and compromised neurotransmission and susceptible to be modified by 5HT pharmacotherapy.

The principal topic of investigation is whether the thickness of one area of the cortex changes in a statistically correlated fashion with changes in thickness of other cortical regions. We further extend these methods by introducing techniques to test whether different population groupings exhibit significantly varying MACACC patterns. The methods are described in detail and applied to a normal childhood development population (n = 292), and show that association cortices have the highest correlation strengths. Taking Brodmann Area (BA) 44 as a seed region revealed MACACC patterns strikingly similar to tractography maps obtained from diffusion tensor imaging. Furthermore, the MACACC map of BA 44 changed with age, older subjects featuring tighter correlations with BA 44 in the anterior portions of the superior temporal gyri. Lastly, IQ-dependent MACACC differences were investigated, revealing steeper correlations between BA 44 and multiple frontal and parietal regions for the higher IQ group, most significantly (t = 4.0) in the anterior cingulate.

Concentrations of total mercury in blood and PCB 153 in plasma had been measured at birth and they were again measured at the time of testing in 102 preschool aged children. Relationships between contaminants and pattern-reversal visual evoked potentials (VEPs) were assessed by multivariate regression analyses, taking into account several potential confounding variables. The possible protective effects of selenium and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids against methylmercury and PCB toxicity were also investigated. Results indicate that exposure to methylmercury and PCBs resulting from fish and sea mammal consumption were associated with alterations of VEP responses, especially for the latency of the N75 and of the P100 components. In contrast, the concomitant intake of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids was associated with a shorter latency of the P100. However, no significant interactions between nutrients and contaminants were found, contradicting the notion that these nutrients could afford protection against environmental neurotoxicants. Interestingly, significant associations were found with concentrations of neurotoxicants in blood samples collected at the time of testing, i.e. at the preschool age. Our findings suggest that VEP can be used as a valuable tool to assess the developmental neurotoxicity of environmental contaminants in fish-eating populations. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Colour vision discrimination, in part a dopamine dependent process, has been used to identify early neurological effects of some environmental and industrial neurotoxicants. The objective of this cross-sectional study was to explore the relationship between platelet MAO-B activity and acquired colour discrimination capacity in fish-consumers from the St. Lawrence River region of Canada. Assessment of acquired dyschromatopsia was determined using the Lanthony D-15 desaturated panel test. Participants classified with dyschromatopsia (n=81) had significantly lower MAO-B activity when compared to those with normal colour vision (n=32) (26.5 +/- 9.6 versus 31.0 +/- 9.9 nmol/min/20 mu g, P=0.030)). Similarly, Bowman's Colour Confusion Index (CCI) was inversely correlated with MAO-B activity when the vision test was performed with the worst eye only (r=-0.245, P=0.009), the best eye only (r=-0.188, P=0.048) and with both eyes together (r=-0.309, P=0.001). Associations remained significant after adjustment for age and gender when both eyes (P=0.003) and the worst eye (P=0.045) were tested. Adjustment for heavy smoking weakened the association between MAO-B and CCI in the worst eye (P=0.140), but did not alter this association for both eyes (P=0.006). Adjustment for blood-mercury concentrations did not change the association. This study suggests a relationship between reduced MAO-B activity and acquired colour vision loss and both are associated with tobacco smoking. Therefore, results show that platelet MAO-B may be used as a surrogate biochemical marker of acquired colour vision loss. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The purpose of this study is to determine the nature of motion perception deficits in primary open-angle glaucoma by measuring the sensitivity of simple (luminance-defined) and complex (texture-defined) motion, the latter requiring supplementary neural processing to be resolved. These findings will help address the possible extent of the cortical damage in glaucoma that has been recently demonstrated by anatomic and physiological studies. They also serve the purpose of establishing which motion paradigms would be most appropriate for assessing glaucoma-related functional loss. Methods. Direction-identification thresholds for first-order and second-order motion were measured for 26 patients with primary open-angle glaucoma (for both phakic and pseudophakic) and 18 nonglaucomatous observers. Results. The glaucomatous observers showed significantly increased motion thresholds for both first-and second-order motion conditions when compared with nonglaucomatous observers. However, the relative increase in threshold for first-order motion did not differ significantly from that of second-order motion. Conclusions. These findings imply that there is no measurable higher-level cortical function damage caused by the glaucomatous process because no greater loss in second-order motion was observed. Based on the results, we suggest that motion paradigms used to assess functional loss in primary open-angle glaucoma should consist of simple, first-order type stimuli to minimize potential confounds such as those introduced by both the normal and pathologic aging process on complex motion processing (i.e., perimetry using complex motion stimuli).

Global developmental delay is a common reason for presentation for neurologic evaluation. This study examined the role of clinical features in predicting the identification of an underlying cause for a child's global developmental delay. METHODS. Over a 10-year inclusive interval, the case records of all consecutive children < 5 years of age referred to a single ambulatory practice setting for global developmental delay were systematically reviewed. The use of clinical features in predicting the identification of a specific underlying cause for a child's delay was tested using chi(2) analysis. RESULTS. A total of 261 patients eventually met criteria for study inclusion. Mean age at initial evaluation was 33.6 months. An underlying cause was found in 98 children. Commonest etiologic groupings were genetic syndrome/chromosomal abnormality, intrapartum asphyxia, cerebral dysgenesis, psychosocial deprivation, and toxin exposure. Factors associated with the ability to eventually identify an underlying cause included female gender ( 40 of 68 vs 58 of 193), abnormal prenatal/perinatal history ( 52 of 85 vs 46 of 176), absence of autistic features ( 85 of 159 vs 13 of 102), presence of microcephaly ( 26 of 40 vs 72 of 221), abnormal neurologic examination ( 52 of 71 vs 46 of 190), and dysmorphic features ( 44 of 84 vs 54 of 177). In 113 children without any abnormal features identified on history or physical examination, routine screening investigations ( karyotype, fragile X molecular genotyping, and neuroimaging) revealed an underlying etiology in 18. CONCLUSIONS. Etiologic yield in an unselected series of young children with global developmental delay is close to 40% overall and 55% in the absence of any coexisting autistic features. Clinical features are readily apparent that may enhance an expectation of a successful etiologic search. Screening investigations may yield an underlying cause.

We aimed to verify the gastrokinetic capacity of ghrelin in human. Patients with gastroparesis attributed to a neural dysregulation by diabetes (n = 5) or surgical vagotomy (n = 1) were evaluated. The emptying of a test meal (420 kcal) was determined by the C-13 octanoic acid breath test. Saline or synthetic ghrelin 1-4 mu g/kg were given in 1 min bolus at the end of the meal. T-lag and T-1/2 were shorter during ghrelin than during saline administration [33 5 min versus 65 +/- 14 min (p < 0.01) and 119 6 min versus 173 +/- 38 min (p < 0.001)]. Ghrelin injection therefore accelerated gastric emptying of a meal in humans even in presence of a deficient gastric innervation. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Moreover, dysfunction in serotonin (5-HT) neurotransmission has been implicated in depression, suicide and alcoholism. In the present study, we measured the levels of tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH), the main synthetic enzyme of 5-HT synthesis, in specific nuclei of the dorsal raphe (DR) in depressed suicide victims with alcohol dependence and matched psychiatrically normal controls. TPH immunoreactivity (IR) was quantified in frozen tissue sections containing the DR from 8 suicide victims with a diagnosis of major depression and alcohol dependence, and 8 psychiatrically normal control subjects by using immunoautoradiographic methods. We found that the levels of TPH-IR were significantly increased by 46% in the dorsal subnucleus of the DR in depressed suicide victims with alcohol dependence when compared with controls. In contrast, TPH-IR levels did not significantly differ in the other DR subnuclei between depressed, alcoholic suicide subjects, and controls. Our results indicate that abnormalities in 5-HT biosynthesis in the brain of depressed alcoholic suicide subjects are restricted within distinct regions of the DR.

However, its cellular and molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. In the cerebellum, functional hyperemia depends almost exclusively on nitric oxide ( NO). Here, we investigated the role of different neuronal populations in the control of microvascular tone by in situ amperometric detection of NO and infrared videomicroscopy of microvessel movements in rat cerebellar slices. Bath application of an NO donor induced both NO flux and vasodilation. Surprisingly, endogenous release of NO elicited by glutamate was accompanied by vasoconstriction that was abolished by inhibition of Ca2+-phopholipase A2 and impaired by cyclooxygenase and thromboxane synthase inhibition and endothelin A receptor blockade, indicating a role for prostanoids and endothelin 1 in this response. Interestingly, direct stimulation of single endothelin 1-immunopositive Purkinje cells elicited constriction of neighboring microvessels. In contrast to glutamate, NMDA induced both NO flux and vasodilation that were abolished by treatment with a NO synthase inhibitor or with tetrodotoxin. These findings indicate that NO derived from neuronal origin is necessary for vasodilation induced by NMDA and, furthermore, that NO-producing interneurons mediate this vasomotor response. Correspondingly, electrophysiological stimulation of single nitrergic stellate cells by patch clamp was sufficient to release NO and dilate both intraparenchymal and upstream pial microvessels. These findings demonstrate that cerebellar stellate and Purkinje cells dilate and constrict, respectively, neighboring microvessels and highlight distinct roles for different neurons in neurovascular coupling.

Adenoviral-mediated modulation of Sim1 expression in the paraventricular nucleus affects food intake	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						hypothalamus; mice; energy; transcription factor; development; obesity	OBESITY; INTEGRATION; DIVERGENCE; PATHWAYS; NEURONS; SIGNALS; LEPTIN; GENE; MICE; NPY	Haploinsufficency of Sim1, which codes for a basic helix-loop-helix-PAS (PER-ARNT-SIM) transcription factor, causes hyperphagia in mice and humans, without decrease in energy expenditure. Sim1 is expressed in several areas of the brain, including the developing and postnatal paraventricular nucleus (PVN), a region of the hypothalamus that controls food intake. We have previously found that the number of PVN cells is decreased in Sim1(+/-) mice, suggesting that their hyperphagia is caused by a developmental mechanism. However, the possibility that Sim1 functions in the postnatal PVN to control food intake cannot be ruled out. To explore this hypothesis, we used adenoviral vectors to modulate Sim1 expression in the postnatal PVN of wild-type mice. Unilateral stereotaxic injection into the PVN of an adenoviral vector producing a short hairpin RNA directed against Sim1 resulted in a significant increase in food intake, which peaked to 22% 6 d after the procedure, compared with the injection of a control virus. In contrast, injection of an adenovirus that expresses Sim1 induced a decrease in food intake that was maximal on the seventh day after the procedure, reaching 20%. The impact of bilateral injections of these vectors into the PVN was not greater than that of unilateral injections. Together, these results strongly suggest that Sim1 functions along a physiological pathway to control food intake.

From baseline to 1 month after treatment, atrophy was 10 times faster than before treatment. A patient with non-CNS lymphoma showed comparable acute brain atrophy after analogous therapy. These observations suggest that brain atrophy after immunoablation may not be due entirely to the resolution of edema but may be related to chemotoxicity.

Cardiotrophin-like cytokine (CLC)-cytokine-like factor 1 (CLF) composite cytokine is a second ligand for the CNTF alpha-component receptor (CNTFR alpha). This composite cytokine is built on the structural model of IL-12, with a complex formed by a four-helix bundle type I cytokine, CLC (also referred to as CLCF1), bound to a soluble receptor subunit, CLIF (also known as CRLF1). We have reported mutations in the chaperone soluble receptor CLF, causing cold-induced sweating syndrome (CISS). in this study, we studied the CLC-mutated alleles in a patient suffering from a similar disease. This patient was compound heterozygous for two different CLC mutations. The first allele was inactivated by a stop codon at position 107 (Y107X). In the second allele, a R197L mutation in the CLC-predicted binding site to the CNTFR alpha was detected. Functional analysis of the mutated protein revealed an incapacity for R197L CLC to bind to CNTFRa and activate the subsequent signaling events. Structural and docking interaction studies showed that the R197L substitution destabilized the contact site between CLC and CNTFR alpha.

In this report, we investigated the contribution of G6PT to the control of U-87 brain tumor-derived glioma cell survival using small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated suppression of G6PT. Three siRNA constructs were generated and found to suppress up to 91% G6PT gene expression. Flow cytometry analysis of propidium iodide/Annexin-V-stained cells indicated that silencing the G6PT gene induced necrosis and late apoptosis. The anticancer agent curcumin, also inhibited G6PT gene expression by more than 90% and triggered U-87 glioma cells death. Overexpression of recombinant G6PT rescued the cells from curcumin-induced cell death. Targeting G6PT expression may provide a new mechanistic rationale for the action of chemopreventive drugs and lead to the development of new anti-cancer strategies.

To determine whether prion protein can protect against Bax-mediated cell death in vivo, wild-type, null and prion over-expressing mice were subjected to Bax-dependent ethanol induced neuronal apoptotic cell death and the brains were immunostained for active caspase-3 as a downstream marker of Bax activation. Bax activation occurs in all ethanol-injected mice independent of their genotype. A higher level of cell death is present in ethanol-injected null mice than in wild-type and prion over-expressing mice. We conclude that prion protein protects some, but not all neurons, against Bax-mediated cell death in this experimental paradigm.

The mu-selective ligands used in this study were three structurally related peptides, endomorphin-1, endomorphin-2 and morphiceptin, and their analogs modified in position 3 or 4 by introducing 3-(1-naphthyl)-D-alanine (D-1-Nal) or 3-(2-naphthyl)-D-alanine (D-2-Nal). The results obtained for these peptides in [S-35]GTP gamma S binding assay were compared with those obtained for a standard mu-opioid agonist DAMGO. [D-1-Nal(3)]Morphiceptin was more potent in G-protein activation (EC50 value of 82.5 +/- 4.5 nM) than DAMGO (EC50 = 105 +/- 9 nM). [D-2-Nal(3)]Morphiceptin, as well as endomorphin-2 analogs substituted in position 4 by either D-1-Nal or D-2-Nal failed to stimulate [S-35]GTP gamma S binding and were shown to be potent antagonists against DAMGO. It seems that the topographical location of the aromatic ring of position 3 and 4 amino acid residues can result in a completely different mode of action, producing either agonists or antagonists.

Interhemispheric neurophysiological abnormalities and intrahemispheric behavioral impairments have been reported in individuals lacking the corpus callosum. The aim of this study was to examine intrahemispheric neurophysiological function in primary motor cortex devoid of callosal projections. Methods: Intracortical excitatory and inhibitory systems were tested in three individuals with complete agenesis of the corpus callosum and sixteen healthy individuals. These systems were assessed using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) protocols: motor threshold at rest, paired-pulse curve, and cortical silent period. Results: TMS revealed no difference between the patient and control groups on the motor threshold measure, as well as intracortical facilitation and intracortical inhibition systems as tested by paired stimulation. However, intrahemispheric inhibitory function was found to be abnormal in participants without callosal projections, as the cortical silent period duration was significantly increased in the patient group. Conclusion: These data suggest that in addition to previously reported impaired interhemispheric function, patients lacking the entire corpus callosum also display abnormal intrahemispheric excitability of the primary motor cortex.

Here, we show that NEM sensitive fusion ( NSF) protein interacts directly with the GBR heterodimer both in rat brain synaptosomes and in CHO cells, forming a ternary complex that can be regulated by agonist stimulation. Inhibition of NSF binding with a peptide derived from GBR2 ( TAT-Pep-27) did not affect basal signaling activity but almost completely abolished agonist-promoted GBR desensitization in both CHO cells and hippocampal slices. Taken with the role of PKC in the desensitization process, our observation that TAT-Pep-27 prevented both agonist- promoted recruitment of PKC and receptor phosphorylation suggests that NSF is a priming factor required for GBR desensitization. Given that GBR desensitization does not involve receptor internalization, the NSF/PKC coordinated action revealed herein suggests that NSF can regulate GPCR signalling efficacy independently of its role in membrane trafficking. The functional interaction between three bona fide regulators of neurotransmitter release, such as GBR, NSF and PKC, could shed new light on the modulation of presynaptic GBR action.

Patients and Methods HER-2 overexpression was defined as immunohistochemical staining scores of 2+ or 3+. Between November 1998 and May 2002, 196 women with HER-2-overexpressing MBC were randomly assigned to six cycles of either trastuzumab 4 mg/kg loading dose plus 2 mg/kg weekly thereafter with paclitaxel 175 mg/m(2) every 3 weeks (TP), or trastuzumab 4 mg/kg loading dose plus 2 mg/kg weekly thereafter with paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 and carboplatin area under the time-concentration curve = 6 every 3 weeks (TPC) followed by weekly trastuzumab alone. Results Baseline characteristics of the 196 patients were well balanced between study arms. Objective response rate (ORR) was 52% (95% CI, 42% to 62%) for TPC versus 36% (95% CI, 26% to 46%) for TP (P =.04). Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 10.7 months for TPC and 7.1 months for TP (hazard ratio [HR], 0.66; 95% CI, 0.59 to 0.73; P=.03). Improved clinical outcomes with TPC were most evident in HER-2 3+ patients, with an ORR of 57% (95% CI, 45% to 70%) v36% (95% CI, 25% to 48%; P =.03) and median PFS of 13.8 v 7.6 months (P =.005) for TPC and TP, respectively (HR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.46 to 0.64). Both regimens were well tolerated, and febrile neutropenia and neurotoxicity occurred infrequently; grade 4 neutropenia occurred more frequently with TPC (P <.01). Conclusion The addition of carboplatin to paclitaxel and trastuzumab improved ORR and PFS in women with HER-2-overexpressing MBC. This well-tolerated regimen represents a new therapeutic option.

J	McDearmid, JR; Liao, MJ; Drapeau, P				McDearmid, JR; Liao, MJ; Drapeau, P			Glycine receptors regulate interneuron differentiation during spinal network development	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						spinal cord; zebrafish; proliferation	DEVELOPING ZEBRAFISH; PATTERN GENERATOR; PROGENITOR CELLS; SYNAPTIC DRIVE; SUBUNIT; GABA; NEURONS; EMBRYO; EXPRESSION; GLUTAMATE	Glycinergic and GABAergic excitatory chloride-mediated signaling is often the first form of activity to emerge in the nascent nervous system and has been proposed to be essential for several aspects of nervous system development. However, few studies have examined the effects of disrupting glycinergic transmission. Here we perturbed glycinergic transmission in vivo from the onset of development in zebrafish and examined its impact on the formation of the locomotor circuitry. Targeted knockdown of the embryonic glycine receptor alpha 2-subunit disrupted rhythm-generating networks and reduced the frequency of spontaneous glycinergic and glutamatergic events. Immunohistochemistry revealed a reduction in the number of spinal interneurons without affecting sensory and motor neurons. This effect was accompanied by a concomitant increase in the number of mitotic cells, suggesting that glycine receptors regulate interneuron differentiation during early development. Despite the loss of many interneurons, a subthreshold rhythm-generating circuit was still capable of forming. These data provide evidence that glycine receptors, in addition to their role in neurotransmission, regulate interneuron differentiation during development of this central neural network.

J	Duval, C				Duval, C			Rest and postural tremors in patients with Parkinson's disease	BRAIN RESEARCH BULLETIN			English	Article						laser displacement sensor; power spectrum; power distribution	FREQUENCY	The mild tremor of twenty-four patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) was quantified in four conditions: finger-rest, finger-postural, hand-rest and hand-postural. Tremor characteristics such as amplitude, median power frequency, power dispersion, and power percentage within the 4-7 Hz band were correlated across conditions. Results show that all tremor characteristics were well correlated across conditions (Spearman's Rank), signifying that presence of PD rest tremor was accompanied with a postural tremor having similar characteristics to that of rest tremor. The present results suggest that neural mechanisms involved in PD rest tremor do remain active in the postural condition, even in patients with mild tremor. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

In this article, an overview of the epidemiological evidence is presented with a discussion of a number of methodological issues important in this area of study. Literature searches were conducted using the MEDLINE database from 1966 through to August 2005 to identify articles that explored a personal history of allergic disorders as a risk factor for cancer. Although it is difficult to draw conclusions between allergy and cancer at many sites because of insufficient evidence or a lack of consistency both within and among studies completed to date, strong inverse associations have been reported for pancreatic cancer and glioma, whereas lung cancer was positively associated with asthma. Additional studies are needed to confirm these finding and to address the limitations of previous studies, including the validity and reliability of exposure measures and control for confounding. Further, large prospective studies using cancer incidence would be particularly useful, including studies using biological markers of allergic status to reduce potential misclassification and to confirm the results of previous studies based on self-report. There is also a need for further basic research to clarify a potential mechanism, should an association exist. (c) 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

In previous studies, the width of action potentials was used as a criterion to identify putative serotonergic neurons, and to demonstrate that cells with broad spikes were more active in wakefulness, slowed down their activity in slow wave sleep and became virtually silent during paradoxical sleep. However, recent studies reported that about half of these presumed serotonergic cells were not immunoreactive for tyrosine hydroxylase. Here, we re-examine the electrophysiological properties of dorsal raphe cells across the sleep-wake cycle in rats by the extracellular recording of a large sample of single units (n = 770). We identified two major types of cells, which differ in spike waveform: a first population characterized by broad, mostly positive spikes, and a second one displaying symmetrical positive-negative spikes with a large distribution of spike durations (0.6-3.2 ms). Although we found classical broad-spike cells that were more active in wakefulness, we also found that about one-third of these cells increased or did not change their firing rate during sleep compared with wakefulness. Moreover, 62% of the latter cells were active in paradoxical sleep when most of raphe cells were silent. Such a diversity in the neuronal firing behaviour is important in the light of the recent controversy regarding the neurochemical identity of dorsal raphe cells exhibiting broad spikes. Our results also suggest that the dorsal raphe contains subpopulations of neurons with reciprocal activity across the sleep-wake cycle.

Activity-dependent synaptic plasticity in the supraoptic nucleus of the rat hypothalamus	JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY-LONDON			English	Article							LONG-TERM POTENTIATION; D-ASPARTATE RECEPTOR; IN-VITRO; MAGNOCELLULAR NEURONS; VASOPRESSIN NEURONS; OXYTOCIN; MECHANISMS; CELLS; CURRENTS; ACID	Activity-dependent long-term synaptic changes were investigated at glutamatergic synapses in the supraoptic nucleus (SON) of the rat hypothalamus. In acute hypothalamic slices, high frequency stimulation (HFS) of afferent fibres caused long-term potentiation (LTP) of the amplitude of AMPA receptor-mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) recorded with the whole-cell patch-damp technique. LTP was also obtained in response to membrane depolarization paired with mild afferent stimulation. On the other hand, stimulating the inputs at 5 Hz for 3 min at resting membrane potential caused long-term depression (LTD) of excitatory transmission in the SON. These forms of synaptic plasticity required the activation of NMDA receptors since they were abolished in the presence Of D-AP5 or ifenprodil, two selective blockers of these receptors. Analysis of paired-pulse facilitation and trial-to-trial variability indicated that LTP and LTD were not associated with changes in the probability of transmitter release, thereby suggesting that the locus of expression of these phenomena was postsynaptic. Using sharp microelectrode recordings in a hypothalamic explant preparation, we found that HFS also generates LTP at functionally defined glutamatergic synapses formed between the organum vasculosum lamina terminalis and SON neurons. Taken together, our findings indicate that glutamatergic synapses in the SON exhibit activity-dependent long-term synaptic changes similar to those prevailing in other brain areas. Such forms of plasticity could play an important role in the context of physiological responses, like dehydration or lactation, where the activity of presynaptic glutamatergic neurons is strongly increased.

Women meeting DSM-IV criteria for anorexia nervosa, (AN, 16 with the restricting subtype and 14 with the binge-purge subtype) and 49 healthy control women (CW) provided blood samples for analyses of platelet [H-3]paroxetine binding. Participants also filled out questionnaires tapping eating disorder symptoms, depression, and personality pathology. Compared with CW, women with restricting and binge-purge AN had significantly lower levels of paroxetine binding (respectively: 1012+487 vs. 560+253 vs. 618+217 fmol/mg protein). Simple correlation analyses showed that, within AN but not within controls, paroxetine binding was inversely related to dieting preoccupations, affective instability, anxiousness, compulsivity, restricted expression and social avoidance but independent of age, body mass index, depression, and other eating symptoms. Findings suggest that reduced peripheral serotonin transporter density in AN relates to increased dieting preoccupations, affective instability and anxiousness-fearfulness.

Here, we asked whether rodent and human skin-derived precursors (SKPs), neural crest-related precursors found in neonatal dermis, represent a source of functional, myelinating Schwann cells. Specifically, cultured SKPs responded to neural crest cues such as neuregulins to generate Schwann cells, and these Schwann cells proliferated and induced myelin proteins when in contact with sensory neuron axons in culture. Similar results were obtained in vivo; 6 weeks after transplantation of naive SKPs or SKP-derived Schwann cells into the injured peripheral nerve of wild-type or shiverer mutant mice (which are genetically deficient in myelin basic protein), the majority of SKP-derived cells had associated with and myelinated axons. Naive rodent or human SKPs also generated Schwann cells that myelinated CNS axons when transplanted into the dysmyelinated brain of neonatal shiverer mice. Thus, neonatal SKPs generate functional neural progeny in response to appropriate neural crest cues and, in so doing, provide a highly accessible source of myelinating cells for treatment of nervous system injury, congenital leukodystrophies, and dysmyelinating disorders.

J	Apuzzo, S; Gros, P				Apuzzo, S; Gros, P			The paired domain of Pax3 contains a putative homeodomain interaction pocket defined by cysteine scanning mutagenesis	BIOCHEMISTRY			English	Article							DNA-BINDING ACTIVITY; SPLOTCH MUTANT MOUSE; SYNDROME TYPE-I; WAARDENBURG-SYNDROME; CRYSTAL-STRUCTURE; GENOMIC STRUCTURE; MUTATIONS; GENE; IDENTIFICATION; COMPLEX	Pax3 is a transcription factor that plays an important regulatory role during neurogenesis, myogenesis, and formation of neural crest cell derived structures. Pax3 has two DNA binding domains, a paired domain ( PD) and paired-type homeodomain ( HD) that show complete interdependence for DNA binding, with mutations in one domain impairing DNA binding by the other domain. Cooperative interactions between the PD and HD of Pax3 suggest that the two domains may physically interact for DNA binding. Site-specific modification with thiol reagents in single cysteine Pax3 mutants was used to determine which segment of the PD may interact with the HD. Twenty-four single cysteine mutants were independently introduced in the second alpha-helix ( alpha 2, positions 59-80) and in the beta-hairpin structure ( positions 40-41) at the amino terminal portion of the PD. These mutants were tested for their ability to bind to PD ( P6CON, P3OPT) and HD-specific DNA targets ( P2), and the effect of treatment with N-ethylmaleimide on these binding properties was established. In the PD, single cysteine mutants CL/Q40C, CL/I59C, CL/V60C, CL/P69C, CL/S70C, CL/I72C, CL/S73C, CL/L76C, CL/V78C, and CL/S79C displayed NEM sensitive DNA binding toward both PD and HD targets. Three PD mutants ( CL/L41C, CL/A63C, and CL/H64C) showed unusual behavior, with DNA binding to PD targets being NEM insensitive while DNA binding by the HD was abrogated by NEM treatment. Three-dimensional modeling of the NEM sensitive PD cysteine mutants reveal that they are not randomly distributed, but rather that they cluster in a hydrophobic pocket. We propose that this hydrophobic pocket may serve as a docking site for the HD during DNA binding by the intact protein.

The medial prefrontal cortex was unilaterally lesioned with ibotenic acid and 10 days later brain sections were processed for neurotensin receptor autoradiographic analysis using 0.1 nM [I-125-Tyr3]neurotensin with, or without, levocabastine. Analysis revealed at least two sites, one levocabastine-insensitive neurotensin NT1 and one levocabastine-sensitive neurotensin NT2-like. The proportion of the latter site was high within the caudal striatum, the nucleus accumbens and the medial prefrontal cortex. Lesions produced a 60% to 80% reduction in neurotensin NT1 within the ipsilateral medial prefrontal cortex, but no change in the sub-cortical nuclei. An increase in neurotensin NT2-like receptors was found in ipsitateral dorso-caudal caudate. These results show that a significant amount of neurotensin NTI receptors are located on neurons within the medial prefrontal cortex but not on their efferent terminals.

First, primary cell cultures were used to determine the susceptibility of each type of neural cells to virus infection. Neurons were the target cells, undergoing degeneration during infection, in part due to apoptosis. Second, neuropathogenicity was investigated in susceptible mice. Intracerebral inoculation of HCoV-OC43 into BALB/c mice led to an acute encephalitis with neuronal cell death by necrosis and apoptosis. Infectious virus was apparently cleared from surviving animals, whereas viral RNA persisted for several months. Some of the animals surviving to acute encephalitis presented an abnormal limb clasping reflex and a decrease in motor activity starting several months post-infection. These results suggest that viral persistence could be associated with an increased neuronal degeneration leading to neuropathology and motor deficits in susceptible individuals.

J	Przybyszewski, AW; Sosale, S; Chaudhuri, A				Przybyszewski, Andrzej W.; Sosale, Sripad; Chaudhuri, Avi			Quantification of three-dimensional exploration in the cylinder test by the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus)	BEHAVIOURAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						cylinder test; exploration; marmoset; horizontal progression; locomotion	EXTRASTRIATE CORTICES; FORNIX TRANSECTION; WORKING-MEMORY; VISUAL AREAS; MONKEYS; PRIMATE; CORTEX; BEHAVIOR; LESIONS; RATS	The increasing trend in use of marmoset monkeys in behavioral studies has necessitated a greater understanding of their natural behavior, especially within confined spatial environments. One way to approach this issue is to examine locomotor and exploratory strategies using the cylinder test, as done recently for the rat by Gharbawie et al. [Gharbawie OA, Whishaw PA, Whishaw IQ. The topography of three-dimensional exploration: a new quantification of vertical and horizontal exploration, postural support, and exploratory bouts in the cylinder test. Behav Brain Res 2004; 151:125-35]. We have used this paradigm in conjunction with Eshkol-Wachmann movement analysis in marmoset monkeys. We provide evidence that marmosets display systematic changes in both horizontal and vertical progressions during exploration. Quantitative analysis and comparison with the extant data in rats showed both similarities and differences. For example, both species display horizontal and vertical scanning movements, although the variability is considerably greater for the marmoset. The horizontal progressions consist of head scans, turning, and stepping. The amplitude of these progressions oscillates and decreases with trial duration. Vertical progressions, which consist of rears, head scans, and descent, also strongly oscillate but with constant mean amplitude during a trial. The difference between the two species is most evident in locomotor behavior. Rats use their forepaws primarily for postural support and follow forequarter movements while body weight shifts are generated by the hind limbs. Marmosets, however, can hold a vertical position without hand support and display more complex movement characteristics during exploration.

BRM contains an N-terminal polyglutamine domain, encoded by a polymorphic trinucleotide (CAA/CAG) repeat, the only known polymorphism in the coding region of the gene (SMARCA2). We have examined the association of this polymorphism with schizophrenia in a family-based and case/ control study. SMARCA2 was chosen as a candidate gene because of its specific role in developmental pathways, its high expression level in the brain and some evidence of its association with schizophrenia spectrum disorder from genome-wide linkage analysis. Results: Family-based analysis with 281 complete and incomplete triads showed that there is no significant preferential transmission of any of the alleles to the affected offspring. Also, in the case/control analysis, similar allele and genotype distributions were observed between affected cases (n = = 289) and unaffected controls (n = 273) in each of three Caucasian populations studied: French Canadian, Tunisian and other Caucasians of European origin. Conclusion: Results from our family-based and case-control association study suggest that there is no association between the trinucleotide repeat polymorphism within SMARCA2 and schizophrenia.

Other evidence has shown that alcohol administration can influence endorphinergic and enkephalinergic activity, while very few studies have examined its effect on dynorphinergic systems. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of alcohol administration or a mechanical stressor on extracellular levels of dynorphin A(1-8) in the rat nucleus accumbens-a brain region that plays a significant role in the processes underlying reinforcement and stress. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were implanted with a microdialysis probe aimed at the shell region of the nucleus accumbens. Artificial cerebrospinal fluid was pumped at a rate of 1.5 mu L/min in awake and freely moving animals and the dialysate was collected at 30-minute intervals. In one experiment, following a baseline period, rats were injected intraperitoneally with either physiological saline or 1 of 3 doses of alcohol, 0.8, 1.6, or 3.2 g ethanol/kg body weight. In a second experiment, following a baseline period, rats were applied a clothespin to the base of their tail for 20 minutes. The levels of dynorphin A(1-8) in the dialysate were analyzed with solid-phase radioimmunoassay. Relative to saline-treated controls, an alcohol dose of 1.6 and 3.2 g/kg caused a transient increase in the extracellular levels of dynorphin A(1-8) in the first 30 minutes of alcohol administration. However, the effect resulting from the high 3.2 g/kg dose was far more pronounced and more significant than with the moderate dose. There was no effect of tail pinch on dynorphin A(1-8) levels in the nucleus accumbens. In this experiment, a very high dose of alcohol was especially capable of stimulating dynorphin A(1-8) release in the nucleus accumbens. Dynorphin release in the accumbens has been previously associated with aversive stimuli and may thus reflect a system underlying the aversive properties of high-dose alcohol administration. However, the lack of effect of tail-pinch stress in the present study suggests that dynorphin A(1-8) is not released in response to all forms of stressful/aversive stimuli.

This phase II trial sought to determine the activity and toxicity of temozolomide in metastatic breast cancer (MBC). Temozolomide was administered in a dose dense schedule of 150 mg/m(2) on days 1-7 and 15-21 in a 28-day cycle. Materials and methods: Patients had unidimensional disease for response assessment by RECIST criteria, up to two prior chemotherapy regimens for MBC, and may have had brain metastases if radiation was not expected to be required within 4 weeks. Results: Nineteen women were entered on the study. All were evaluable for toxicity and 18 were evaluable for response. The median age was 54 years; 14 had prior chemotherapy for MBC and 12 had prior hormones. Sites of disease included bone, brain, liver and lung. Treatment was well tolerated with 14/19 receiving > 90% planned dose intensity. Common grade 1-3 drug-related effects included nausea, fatigue, vomiting, anorexia and skin rash. Grade 3-4 hematologic toxicities included granulocytopenia and thrombocytopenia. Of the 18 evaluable patients, there were no objective responses; three had stable disease and 15 progressive disease. Conclusions: No responses to temozolomide were documented in these heavily pretreated women with extensive MBC including brain metastases.

Design: Group comparison study. Setting: Gait analysis laboratory within a postacute rehabilitation facility. Participants: Volunteer sample of 9 people (8 men, 1 woman; age, 39.3 +/- 13.0 y) with moderate to severe TBI and a comparison group of 9 subjects without neurologic problems matched for age and sex (8 men, 1 woman; age, 39.7 +/- 12.3y). Interventions: Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures: Reading times for the Stroop bar and Stroop word tasks, walking speeds, stride lengths, and obstacle clearance margin. Results: The TBI group was slower than the control group in performing the Stroop bar task during sitting (P = .002), and while avoiding the narrow obstacle (P = .05), and in performing 9 the Stroop word task while avoiding the wide obstacle (P = .019). Despite their relatively normal gait speeds on level ground, subjects with TBI walked more slowly than control subjects for the narrow (P = .024) and the wide (P = .019) obstacle conditions and for the most complex dual task (P = .042). Greater lead-limb clearance margins were observed for the TBI group than for control subjects for all conditions whereas no differences were found for the trail limb except at the far end of the wide obstacle. Conclusions: Despite their good recovery of locomotor function, with respect to normal level walking speeds and ability to avoid obstacles, subjects with moderate and severe TBI showed residual deficits in relation to greater difficulties in dealing with environments that challenge their locomotor and attentional abilities. The use of such naturally based dual tasks may help identify some of the environmental obstructions to social participation after TBI.

To be effective as a biological control method, such a technique would require that the increase in female abundance translate in an increase egg deposition. An experiment was conducted to evaluate whether the honeydew-feeding females of the green lacewing Chrysoperla rufilabris (Burmeister) avoid laying eggs in the presence of conspecific eggs. The potential risk associated with oviposition in a site already occupied by conspecific eggs was also studied. The preference of C rufilabris larvae for kin and non-kin eggs and the susceptibility of C rufilabris eggs to cannibalism relative to their age was determined. The results demonstrate that females are not reluctant to oviposit in the presence of conspecific eggs. Larvae show no preference for kin or non-kin eggs, and lacewing eggs become less susceptible to cannibalism as they age. This indicates that the risk of egg cannibalism by neonate in the field may be low. The results are discussed from ecological and biological control points of view. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

According to the simulation the transmitter release is largely determined by geometric factors - the ratio of the fusion pore cross-sectional and vesicular areas, if the diffusion constant is as in the aqueous solution - but the speed of transmitter dissociation from the gel matrix plays an important role during the rise phase of release. Transmitter is not depleted near the entrance to the fusion pore and there is no cleft-to-vesicle feedback, but the depletion becomes evident if the diffusion constant is reduced, especially if the pore is wide. In general, the time course of amperometric currents closely resembles the time course of the simulated transmitter concentration in the cleft and the time course of release. Surprisingly, even a tenfold change of the electrode efficiency has only a marginal effect on the amplitude or the time course of amperometric currents. Greater electrode efficiency however lowers the cleft concentration, but only if the cleft is narrow. As the cleft widens the current amplitudes diminish and rise times lengthen, but the decay times are less affected. Moreover, the amplitude dependence of the rise and decay times becomes steeper as the cleft widens and/or as the release kinetics slows. Finally, lower diffusion constant of transmitter in the narrow cleft does not further prolong the amperometric currents, whose slow time course reflects slow release kinetics.

Our results show that trials which repeat in a mixed-task block (repeat trials) were more demanding than trials which repeated in a single-task block, as reflected by the presence of a RT mixing cost and by the presence of a smaller target-locked positivity (P3b) on repeat trials. Within a mixed-task block, repeat and switch trials also differed, where repeat trials showed evidence of greater preparation (larger cue-locked negativity), more efficient target processing (larger target-locked P3b), and shorter RTs. In addition, the cue-locked negativity difference remained despite equating repeat and switch trials on RT, suggesting that this negativity difference is specific to the switching process. Our results are discussed in light of existing models of task switching. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We describe for the first time similar oscillations in a cohort of unselected focal epileptic patients implanted with EEG macroelectrodes. Spectral analysis and visual inspection techniques were used to study seizures from 10 consecutive patients undergoing pre-surgical evaluation for medically refractory focal epilepsy. Four of these patients had focal seizure onset in the mesial temporal lobe, and in all 12 of their seizures, well-localized, segmental, very high frequency band (VHF: 250500 Hz) oscillations were visually identified near the time of seizure onset from contacts in this zone. Increased high-frequency band (HF: 100-200 Hz) activity compared with the background was distinguished both visually and with spectral analysis later in the seizures of 3/4 mesial temporal patients, involving contacts in the generator region and, in one patient, areas of contralateral peri-hippocampal propagation. Three patients with well-defined neocortical seizure-onset areas also demonstrated focal HF or VHF oscillations confined to the seizure-onset channels during their eight seizures. No discrete HF or VHF activity was present in the poorly localized seizures from the remaining three patients. These results show that discrete HFOs can be recorded from human focal epileptic brain using depth macroelectrodes, and that they occur mostly in regions of primary epileptogenesis and rarely in regions of secondary spread. Absent high-frequency activity seems to indicate poor localization, whereas the presence of focal HFOs near the time of seizure onset may signify proximity to the epileptogenic focus in mesial temporal lobe and neocortical seizures. We postulate that focal HFOs recorded with depth macroelectrodes reflect the partial synchronization of very local oscillations such as those previously studied using microelectrodes, and result from interconnected small neuronal ensembles. Our finding that localized HFOs occur in varying anatomical structures and pathological conditions perhaps indicates commonality to diverse epileptogenic aetiologies.

Research design: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with individuals who had sustained a TBI (n = 8) and their families (n = 8) as well as with the health professionals (or service providers) (n = 22) and physicians (n = 9) who provided them care. Main outcomes and results: Results revealed that the quality of the disclosure is strongly influenced by the medical uncertainty surrounding the TBI and the difficulties of healthcare professionals in dealing with the family's emotions. Conclusions: Delivering bad news is always difficult, but it is possible to make this harrowing experience easier and, in so doing, enhance patient and family resilience.

Tetrodotoxin (TTX) is a powerful sodium channel blocker extracted from the puffer fish. The analgesic effects of TTX were investigated in different animal pain models. Methods. Wistar rats were submitted to the formalin test and to partial ligation of the sciatic nerve (Seltzer's model). Swiss Webster mice were used in the writhing test. Rodents were divided into six groups receiving a s.c. injection of either 0.9% NaCl, TTX 0.3, 1, 3, or 6 mu g kg(-1), or morphine (5 mg kg(-1)). Substances were injected 30 min before 2.5% formalin injection into the hind paw, acetic acid administration intraperitoneally or neuropathic pain testing consisting of mechanical allodynia (von Frey filament) and thermal hyperalgesia (Plantar test). Results. TTX decreased pain behaviour in the formalin test at the highest dose and in the writhing test at 3 and 6 mu g kg(-1). It also diminished mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia with an ED50 of 1.08 (0.89) and 0.62 (0.33) mu g kg(-1), respectively. Observation of the rats after TTX injection did not show any motor deficit, respiratory distress or sedation. Morphine was also effective in relieving pain in all three tests but with signs of considerable sedation. Conclusion. Systemic injections of TTX diminished pain behaviour in a dose-dependent manner in models of inflammatory, visceral and neuropathic pain without causing adverse events, whereas morphine analgesia was associated with heavy sedation. TTX is a very promising substance for the treatment of various types of pain but needs further evaluation.

AM and CGRP receptors are chiefly coupled to cAMP production. In this study, a method of primary dissociated cell culture was used to investigate the presence of AM and CGRP receptors and their effects on cAMP production in embryonic spinal cord cells. 2 Both neuronal and non- neuronal CLR immunopositive cells were present in our model. 3 High affinity, specific [ I-125]- AM binding sites ( K-d 79 +/- 9pM and B-max 571 +/- 34 fmol mg(-1) protein) were more abundant than specific [ I-125]- CGRP binding sites ( K-d 12 +/- 0.7 pM and B-max 32 +/- 2 fmol mg (-1) protein) in embryonic spinal cord cells. 4 Specific [ 125 I]- AM binding was competed by related molecules with a ligand selectivity profile of rAM > hAM(22 - 52) > rCGRP alpha > CGRP(8-37) >>[ r-( r(*), s(*))]- N-[ 2-[[ 5- amino- 1-[[ 4-( 4- pyridinyl)- 1- piperazinyl]carbonyl] pentyl] amino]- 1-[( 3,5- dibromo- 4- hydroxyphenyl) methyl]- 2- oxoethyl]- 4-( 1,4- dihydro- 2- oxo- 3 ( 2H)- quinazolinyl)-, 1- piperidinecarboxamide ( BIBN4096BS). 5 Specific [ 125 I]- CGRP binding was competed by rCGRP alpha > rAM >= GRP(8-37)>= BIBN4096BS > hAM(22-52). 6 Cellular levels of cAMP were increased by AM ( pEC(50) 10.2 +/- 0.2) and less potently by rCGRP alpha ( pEC(50) 8.9 +/- 0.4). rCGRP alpha- induced cAMP accumulation was effectively inhibited by CGRP(8-37) ( pA(2) 7.63 +/- 0.44) and hAM(22 - 52) ( pA(2) 6.18 +/- 0.21) while AM- stimulation of cAMP levels was inhibited by CGRP(8-37) ( pA(2) 7.41 +/- 0.15) and AM(22 - 52) ( pA(2) 7.26 +/- 0.18). BIBN4096BS only antagonized the effects of CGRP ( pA(2) 8.40 +/- 0.30) on cAMP accumulation. 7 These pharmacological profiles suggest that effects of CGRP are mediated by the CGRP(1) ( CLR/ RAMP1) receptor in our model while those of AM are related to the activation of the AM(1) ( CLR/ RAMP2) receptor subtype.

Numerous guidelines for NDD may be applied in clinical practice by a variety of medical practitioners, but the scientific rationale for specific guideline recommendations often remains unclear. This review examines the evolution of NDD, and seeks to provide scientific validation for existing NDD criteria. Source: English language peer-reviewed medical journals and established contemporary medical texts. Principal findings: Currently published guidelines appear to have evolved from the work of the ad hoc Committee of the Harvard Medical School to Examine the Definition of Brain Death. The Conference of the Royal Colleges and Faculties of the United Kingdom refined the criteria and subsequently adopted the principal of brainstem death. While the fundamentals of NDD guidelines are remarkably consistent worldwide, specific criteria and requirements are often inconsistent. Conclusion: Numerous controversies regarding NDD continue to exist, necessitating further scientific clarification of these issues. More recently published guidelines representing the collective opinion of world experts in NDD based upon best current scientific evidence are available in current medical journals.

J	Doig, CJ; Young, K; Teitelbaum, J; Shemie, SD				Doig, CJ; Young, K; Teitelbaum, J; Shemie, SD			Brief survey: Determining brain death in Canadian intensive care units	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ANAESTHESIA-JOURNAL CANADIEN D ANESTHESIE			English	Article								Purpose: Criteria for brain death were first described in 1968, and Canadian guidelines were published in 1988. However, international inconsistency persists in the process of determining brain death. We sought to determine self-reported practices and processes in the determination of brain death amongst Canadian intensive care unit (ICU) physicians. Methods: An email survey of members of the Canadian Critical Care Society was undertaken. A survey instrument was developed, then face and content validated prior to distribution. Results: Eighty eight responded (response rate = 49%), including adult and pediatric ICU physicians working in both tertiary referral (academic) and community hospitals. Most respondents admit patients with brain death to their ICUs. However, 9% reported refusing to admit this type of patient for reasons including inappropriate utilization of ICU resources (36%), and lack of either space or staff (32% and 29% of respondents, respectively). Community hospital-based ICU physicians were less likely to report a hospital policy on the determination of brain death (46% vs 78% of physicians in tertiary care hospitals). Nearly all physicians (96%) reported that a revised national standard and checklist for the determination of death would be useful. Conclusions: Nearly one quarter, and over one half of tertiary care and community hospitals (respectively) in Canada lack an institutional policy on neurological determination of brain death. Canadian ICU physicians are interested in a national standard for the determination of death, and establishment of processes that may improve the clinical determination of death by neurological criteria.

J	Hornby, K; Shemie, SD; Teitelbaum, J; Doig, C				Hornby, K; Shemie, SD; Teitelbaum, J; Doig, C			Variability in hospital-based brain death guidelines in Canada	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ANAESTHESIA-JOURNAL CANADIEN D ANESTHESIE			English	Article							DIAGNOSIS; CRITERIA	Purpose: Variability has been reported in the practices to determine death by neurological criteria for adults and children. The objective of this study was to determine if this variability exists in the Canadian context. Methods: A cross-sectional survey of the Canadian intensive care units (ICUs) involved in the care of potential organ donors, and Canadian organ procurement organizations (OPOs) was undertaken. We contacted the medical directors of these units and asked them to provide their guidelines for the neurological determination of death (NDD). A framework, which identifies key diagnostic criteria for NDD, was used to assess the content of all study documents. Results: With a response rate of 68%, we found that key diagnostic criteria for NDD were incorporated inconsistently in the guidelines from Canadian ICUs and OPOs. Areas of concern include omissions in: the testing of brainstem reflexes; components of the apnea test; indications for the use of supplementary testing; wait intervals prior to performing the first NDD examination; the definition of NDD; and potential confounding factors. In addition, inconsistencies were found pertaining to wait intervals required between examinations and the legal timing of death. Conclusion: These findings reinforce the need to standardize the practice of the neurological determination of death in Canadian centres, which has the potential to reduce practice variation. Clear medical standards for NDD augment the quality, rigour and credibility of this determination.

J	Robitaille, N; Jolicoeur, P				Robitaille, Nicolas; Jolicoeur, Pierre			Fundamental properties of the N2pc as an index of spatial attention: Effects of masking	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE PSYCHOLOGIE EXPERIMENTALE			English	Article							DUAL-TASK INTERFERENCE; VISUAL-SEARCH; HUMAN ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY; OBJECT SUBSTITUTION; RESPONSE-SELECTION; BLINK PARADIGM; CONSOLIDATION; SUPPRESSION; COMPONENT	Masking is an important tool in many paradigms used to study the cognitive architecture. The N2pc is an electrophysiological event-related potential (ERP) that has been used as a tool to study the deployment of visual spatial attention. The aim of this paper was to study the effects of masking on the N2pc. Two stimuli were presented on the screen, one to left and one to right of fixation, and subjects reported the identity of one of them. The targets could be discriminated both by their category (letters vs. digit) and by their colour (pink vs. green). Backward masking was produced by presenting a second pair of bilateral stimuli after the offset of the first pair. The second pair of stimuli consisted of characters of the same colour and category as in the first pair. Forward masking was produced by using the very same stimuli as in the backward masking condition, but by instructing subjects to report the second stimulus. The forward mask trials had longer response times compared to no-mask trials, and backward mask trials had even longer response times, and also a higher error rate. Although the different masking procedures lead to clear behavioural effects,, the N2pc was not affected, suggesting that the deployment of visual spatial attention, per se, was not affected by pattern masking. A sustained posterior contralateral negativity (SPCN) following the N2pc was also found (300 ms post-target, and beyond), and the amplitude of the SPCN was strongly modulated by the number of presented stimuli and the duration of the SPCN was positively correlated with RT in the behavioural task. We hypothesize that the SPCN reflects neural activity associated with the passage of information through visual short-term memory.

Many neurons in mammalian visual cortex show orientation preference to both types of boundaries, but it is uncertain how they contribute to perceptual orientation cue-invariance at the neuronal population level. Using optical imaging in cat A18, we observed highly similar orientation preference maps to first-order and a variety of second-order visual stimuli. Thus the neuronal representation of coarse-scale boundary orientation appears to be invariant to the characteristics (including local orientation) of the fine-scale textures by which those boundaries are defined. A common feature of second-order visual stimuli is that modulation shifts their Fourier energy for boundary orientation to the higher spatial frequencies of their constituent textures - our results suggest a common neural mechanism (demodulation) mediating visual processing of many kinds of texture boundary. The similarity between orientation maps to different stimuli implies that second-order responsive neurons are homogeneously distributed across the cortical surface. Such homogeneously cue-invariant orientation representation could provide a neural substrate for perceptual form-cue invariance, and reflect an optimal organization for encoding orientation information in natural scenes.

Nevertheless, a gulf exists between the two fields, with researchers in one often being unaware of similar work in the other. In this Special Issue, we focus on bridging this gap and present a collection of papers from both fields together. For each field, the networks studied range from just a single gene or neuron to endogenous networks. In this introductory article, we describe the sources of noise in both genetic and neural systems. We discuss the modeling techniques in each area and point out similarities. We hope that, by reading both sets of papers, ideas developed in one field will give insight to scientists from the other and that a common language and methodology will develop.

Numerous studies have found that hormone therapy (HT) helps to protect verbal memory, a hippocampal function. Estrogen receptors are also found in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), suggesting that estrogen may modulate executive and working memory functions, both mediated by the PFC. The possible role of progesterone (P) on executive functions and working memory is unknown. Objective To examine the relationship between neuropsychological performance, age of initiation of HT, and duration of HT use. Method In this cross-sectional study, the neuropsychological performance of 37 postmenopausal women (mean age, 65 years) who used either estrogen-only or sequential E + P (E-alone group) (n = 22) or E + P continuously (n = 15) was compared to that of 28 healthy postmenopausal women matched for age and education who had never used HT. It was hypothesized that the E-only users would perform better then the E + P and the never-users on neuropsychological tests of verbal memory, executive function and working memory. Results Results showed only minor between-group differences on working memory scores such that the E + P users were slowest to generate a response on the N-Back test of working memory. No group differences on tests of executive functions were found. Conclusion There was no relationship between neuropsychological performance, age of initiation of HT, or duration of HT use.

Methods: Eight subjects with an incomplete spinal cord injury and eight age- and sex-matched healthy control subjects walked on a treadmill at five different grades (from -10 to 10%) without any assistance. The movements of the trunk and pelvis were recorded with four high-resolution cameras. Results: The SCI subjects walked with greater forward tilt of both trunk and pelvic segments during level or inclined walking and could not adapt their body orientation to the inclination of the support surface as observed in healthy control subjects. Trunk and pelvic rotations as well as lateral excursions were maintained constant during inclined walking in both groups of subjects but total excursions were always greater in the SCI subjects. Conclusions: We argue that the forward bending posture observed in SCI subjects at any treadmill grade is adopted to compensate for a certain degree of instability due to lower-limb deficits and is a postural adaptation to the daily use of ambulatory assistive devices. Significance: The bent posture adopted by SCI subjects is not adequate when performing level or downhill walking and can lead to a loss of balance or a fall in these subjects.

Maternal care associated with methylation of the estrogen receptor-alpha 1b promoter and estrogen receptor-alpha expression in the medial preoptic area of female offspring	ENDOCRINOLOGY			English	Article							OXYTOCIN RECEPTOR; ALTERNATIVE PROMOTERS; GENE-EXPRESSION; MESSENGER-RNA; RAT; BEHAVIOR; BRAIN; SENSITIVITY; RESPONSES; CHROMATIN	Variations in maternal behavior are associated with differences in estrogen receptor (ER)-alpha expression in the medial preoptic area (MPOA) and are transmitted across generations such that, as adults, the female offspring of mothers that exhibit increased pup licking/grooming (LG) over the first week postpartum (i.e. high LG mothers) show increased ER alpha expression in the MPOA and are themselves high LG mothers. In the present studies, cross-fostering confirmed an association between maternal care and ER alpha expression in the MPOA; the biological offspring of low LG mothers fostered at birth to high LG dams show increased ER alpha expression in the MPOA. Cross-fostering the biological offspring of high LG mothers to low LG dams produces the opposite effect. We examined whether the maternal programing of ER alpha expression is associated with differences in methylation of the relevant ER alpha promoter. Levels of cytosine methylation across the ER alpha 1b promoter were significantly elevated in the adult offspring of low, compared with high, LG mothers. Differentially methylated regions included a signal transducer and activator of transcription (Stat)5 binding site and the results of chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed decreased Stat5b binding to the ER alpha 1b promoter in the adult offspring of low, compared with high, LG mothers. Finally, we found increased Stat5b levels in the MPOA of neonates reared by high, compared with low, LG mothers. These findings suggest that maternal care is associated with cytosine methylation of the ER alpha 1b promoter, providing a potential mechanism for the programming of individual differences in ER alpha expression and maternal behavior in the female offspring.

J	Lacoste, B; Riad, M; Descarries, L				Lacoste, Baptiste; Riad, Mustapha; Descarries, Laurent			Immunocytochemical evidence for the existence of substance P receptor (NK1) in serotonin neurons of rat and mouse dorsal raphe nucleus	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						cellular distribution; immunocytochemistry; mood; neurokinin receptors	CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; KNOCK-OUT MICE; PHA-L ANALYSIS; NEUROKININ-1 RECEPTORS; IN-VIVO; BRAIN-STEM; 5-HT1A AUTORECEPTORS; PERIAQUEDUCTAL GRAY; MONOCLONAL-ANTIBODY; INTERNALIZATION	In addition to its neurotransmitter/modulator role in pain perception, substance P (SP) is involved in a regulation of mood, as antagonists of its neurokinin-1 receptor (NK1r) have been found to have antidepressant-like effects in humans. In rodents, treatment with NK1r antagonists has been shown to increase the firing of dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) neurons and to induce a desensitization of their 5-HT1A autoreceptors, suggesting local interactions between the SP and 5-HT systems. To search for the presence of NK1r on 5-HT neurons of the DRN, we used light and electron microscopic immunocytochemistry, as well as confocal microscopy, after single- and double-labelling of NK1r and of the biosynthetic enzyme of 5-HT, tryptophan hydroxylase (TpOH). A significant number of 5-HT (TpOH-positive) cell bodies and dendrites endowed with NK1r were thus demonstrated in the caudal part of rat and mouse DRN. As visualized by electron microscopy after gold immunolabelling, NK1r was mostly cytoplasmic in 5-HT neurons, while predominating on the plasma membrane in the case of TpOH-negative dendrites. The proportion of NK1r observed on the plasma membrane of 5-HT neurons was, however, slightly higher in mouse than rat. Thus, in both rat and mouse DRN, a subpopulation of 5-HT neurons is endowed with NK1r receptors and may be directly involved in the antidepressant-like effects of NK1r antagonists. These 5-HT neurons represent a new element in the neuronal circuitry currently proposed to account for the role of SP in mood regulation.

The current study sought to determine whether electrophysiological markers could be used as objective measures of voice familiarity, by looking at the electrophysiological responses [mismatch negativity (MMN) and P3a] when the infrequent stimulus presented is a familiar voice as opposed to an unfamiliar voice. Results indicate that the MMN elicited by a familiar voice is greater than that elicited by an unfamiliar voice at FCz. The familiar voice also produced a greater P3a wave than that triggered by the unfamiliar voice at Fz. As both the MMN and the P3a were elicited as participants were instructed not to pay attention to incoming stimulation, these findings suggest that voice recognition is a particularly potent preattentive process whose neural representations can be objectively described through electrophysiological assessments.

ALS is characterized by an extensive loss of motoneurons in the cerebrospinal axis, except for those motoneurons that control eye movements and bladder contraction. The reason for this selectivity is not known. Systematic differences have been found in the organization of excitatory synaptic transmission in ALS-resistant vs. ALS-susceptible motor nuclei. However, although motoneurons express high levels of glycine receptors (GlyR) and GABA(A) receptors (GABA(A)R), no such studies have been carried out yet for inhibitory synaptic transmission. In this study, we compared the subunit composition, patterns of expression, density and synaptic localization of inhibitory synaptic receptors in ALS-resistant (oculomotor, trochlear and abducens) and ALS-vulnerable motoneurons (trigeminal, facial and hypoglossi). Triple immunofluorescent stainings of the major GABA(A)R subunits (alpha 1, alpha 2, alpha 3, and alpha 5), the GlyR all subunit and gephyrin, were visualized by confocal microscopy and analysed quantitatively. A strong correlation was observed between the vulnerability of motoneurons and the subunit composition of GABA(A)R, the GlyR/GABA(A)R density ratios and the incidence of synaptic vs. extrasynaptic GABA(A)R. These differences contrast strikingly with the uniform gephyrin cluster density and synaptic GlyR levels recorded in all motor nuclei examined. These results suggest that the specific patterns of inhibitory receptor organization observed might reflect functional differences that are relevant to the physiopathology of ALS.

J	Kobayashi, E; Bagshaw, AP; Grova, C; Dubeau, F; Gotman, J				Kobayashi, E; Bagshaw, AP; Grova, C; Dubeau, F; Gotman, J			Negative BOLD responses to epileptic spikes	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING			English	Article						deactivation; EEG-fMRI; epileptiform discharges; epilepsy; MRI	FOCAL INTERICTAL SPIKES; EEG-FMRI; COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; SIGNAL DECREASES; FUNCTIONAL MRI; REACTION-TIME; DISCHARGES; CORTEX; BRAIN; WAVE	Simultaneous electroencephalogram/functional magnetic resonance imaging (EEG-fMRI) during interictal epileptiform discharges can result in positive (activation) and negative (deactivation) changes in the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal. Activation probably reflects increased neuronal activity and energy demand, but deactivation is more difficult to explain. Our objective was to evaluate the occurrence and significance of deactivations related to epileptiform discharges in epilepsy. We reviewed all EEG-fMRI studies from our database, identified those with robust responses (P = 0.01, with >= 5 contiguous voxels with a vertical bar t vertical bar > 3.1, including >= 1 voxel at vertical bar t vertical bar > 5.0), and divided them into three groups: activation (A = 8), deactivation (D = 9), and both responses (AD = 43). We correlated responses with discharge type and location and evaluated their spatial relationship with regions involved in the "default" brain state (Raichle et al. [2001]: Proc Natl Acad Sci 98:676-682]. Deactivations were seen in 52/60 studies (AD+D): 26 related to focal discharges, 12 bilateral, and 14 generalized. Deactivations were usually distant from anatomical areas related to the discharges and more frequently related to polyspike-and 'spike-and-slow waves than to spikes. The "default" pattern occurred in 10/43 AD studies, often associated with bursts of generalized discharges. In conclusion, deactivations are frequent, mostly with concomitant activation, for focal and generalized discharges. Discharges followed by a slow wave are more likely to result in deactivation, suggesting neuronal inhibition as the underlying phenomenon. Involvement of the "default" areas, related to bursts of generalized discharges, provides evidence of a subclinical effect of the discharges, temporarily suspending normal brain function in the resting state.

On magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), patients with "double cortex" syndrome (DCS) present with a band of heterotopic gray matter separated from the overlying cortex by a layer of white matter. The function and connectivity of the subcortical heterotopic band in humans is only partially understood. We studied six DCS patients with bilateral subcortical band heterotopias and six healthy controls using functional MRI (fMRI). In controls, simple motor task elicited contralateral activation of the primary motor cortex (Ml) and ipsilateral activation of the cerebellum and left supplementary motor area (SMA). All DCS patients showed task-related contralateral activation of both M1 and the underlying heterotopic band. Ipsilateral motor activation was seen in 4/6 DCS patients. Furthermore, there were additional activations of nonprimary normotopic cortical areas. The sensory stimulus resulted in activation of the contralateral primary sensory cortex (SI) and the thalamus in all healthy subjects. The left sensory task also induced a contralateral activation of the insular cortex. Sensory activation of the contralateral SI was seen in all DCS patients and secondary somatosensory areas in 5/6. The heterotopic band beneath SI became activated in 3/6 DCS patients. Activations were also seen in subcortical structures for both paradigms. In DCS, motor and sensory tasks induce an activation of the subcortical heterotopic band. The recruitment of bilateral primary areas and higher-order association normotopic cortices indicates the need for a widespread network to perform simple tasks.

In this paper, we present a nonlinear approach in modeling the viewing-context dependency of the slow-phase angular,VOR. We show that including appropriate nonlinearities in the responses of premotor neurons in the brainstem is sufficient to account for the online modulation of the VOR with target position. This approach allows very complex behaviors in response to sensory patterns without resorting to currently assumed cortical computations. A local premotor topology with nonlinear properties has repercussions in the study of all ocular reflexes, since it implies context dependent dynamics in all behavioral responses (pursuit, optokinetic, VOR, saccades, etc.) that share this network. Local nonlinearities in spinal circuits could similarly influence the context dependence of other motor systems (such as stretch reflex modulation during rhythmic walking).

These are a Bayes classifier, a Dempster-Shafer classifier ensemble in which specialized classifiers are optimized to return a single ship class, a k-nearest neighbor classifier, and an optimized neural net classifier. Two different methods are then studied to fuse the results of selected subsets of these classifiers. The first method consists of using the outputs of various classifiers as inputs to a second neural net fuser. The second method consists of converting the outputs of these classifiers into masses for use in a Dempster-Shafer fuser. In both approaches, the fused classifier achieves better results than the best classifier for any given class. Crown Copyright (C) 2004 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The limbic system with the novelty neurons of the hippocampus interacts with the prefrontal cortex optimization of the orienting reflex and voluntary attention. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor produced by novelty neurons of the hippocampus contributes to long-term memory formation and improves learning abilities in a wide range of disciplines. Synergistic combination of stimulation with "analytical-specific visual perceptual patterns" and "optimally high" physiological activation of the bilateral electrodermal system optimizes the limbic system and prefrontal cortex activity as demonstrated by enhanced prefrontal N450 ERPs to a memory workload paradigm. This is accompanied by improvements in auditory retention tasks, word memorization, higher school achievement and marks, and an amelioration of "analytical-specific perceptual skills" as measured by the Mangina-Test. Intracerebral ERPs to a memory workload paradigm contributed to the elucidation of limbic structures and neocortical sites involved in memory workload processes. The progressive degeneration of these same structures causes the gradual decline of memory functions observed in early Alzheimer's disease. Research findings indicate that ERPs elicited by a memory workload paradigm are sensitive markers for diagnosis, treatment and clinical follow-up of early Alzheimer's patients. In addition, ERPs provide objective measurement of cholinergic medication effects on cerebral functions involved in memory processes through neuropsychophysiological parameters.

The role of temporal changes of more conventional markers of inflammation, such as the white blood cell (WBC) count, on clinical outcomes remains largely unknown. Methods and Results: We performed a retrospective analysis of patients included in the Studies Of Left Ventricular Dysfunction that had documented eligibility at the baseline visit, a documented WBC count at baseline and at least 1 measurement during follow-up. We evaluated the association between variations in WBC count, WBC subtractions and mortality and non-fatal events. An increase in WBC count during follow-up compared with baseline was associated with a significantly higher risk of all-cause and cardiovascular (CV) mortality, HF mortality and arrhythmic death (all P < .05). A relative increase in the neutrophil count was associated with higher risk of all-cause and CV mortality, HF mortality and cardiac ischemic events (all P < .05). No significant interaction was present in regards to the etiology of HF. Conclusions: Temporal increases in WBC and neutrophil counts are associated with increased risks of death and CV events. This relationship appears to be independent of HF etiology.

One important target of these cells is the lateral hypothalamus (LH), which is critical for arousal and the maintenance of wakefulness. To determine whether chemically specific BF neurons provide an innervation to the LH, we employed anterograde transport of 10,000 MW biotinylated dextran amine (BDA) together with immunohistochemical staining of the vesicular transporter proteins (VTPs) for glutamate (VGIuT1, -2, and -3), GABA (VGAT), or acetylcholine (ACh, VAChT). In addition, we applied triple staining for the postsynaptic proteins (PSPs), PSD-95 with VGluT or Gephyrin (Geph) with VGAT, to examine whether the BDA-labeled varicosities may form excitatory or inhibitory synapses in the LH. Axons originating from BDA-labeled neurons in the magnocellular preoptic nucleus (MCPO) and substantia innominata (SI) descended within the medial forebrain bundle and extended collateral varicose fibers to contact LH neurons. In the LH, the BDA-labeled varicosities were immunopositive W for VAChT (similar to 10%), VGluT2 (similar to 25%), or VGAT (similar to 50%), revealing an important influence of newly identified glutamatergic together with GABAergic BF inputs. Moreover, in confocal microscopy, VGluT2+ and VGAT+ terminals were apposed to PSD-95+ and Geph+ profiles respectively, indicating that they formed synaptic contacts with LH neurons. The important inputs from glutamatergic and GABAergic BF cells could thus regulate LH neurons in an opposing manner to stimulate vs. suppress cortical activation and behavioral arousal reciprocally.

We review here the distribution and function of a high-threshold potassium channel (Kv3.3) in the electrosensory lateral line lobe of the weakly electric fish Apteronotus leptorhynchus, with particular focus on the pyramidal cells in this brain structure. These cells contain both high-threshold Kv3.3 channels., as well as low-threshold potassium channels of unknown molecular identity. Kv3.3 potassium channels regulate burst discharge in pyramidal cells and enable sustained high frequency tiring through their ability to reduce an accumulation of low-threshold potassium current.

Fluctuating fatigue of skeletal muscles is the key clinical feature. Late-onset MG is more frequent in elderly men and is often misdiagnosed. While involvement of oropharyngeal musculature has been described with symptoms of dysphagia and slurred speech, the presence of fluctuating dysphonia as the first symptom of late-onset MG has not been emphasized. The case of an elderly man, who demonstrated voice changes and later swallowing impairment with weight loss, is reported. This case presentation of late-onset MG emphasizes that this form of the disease should be considered in the differential diagnosis of acute onset dysphonia in elderly persons.

To address this issue, glutamine synthetase expression and activities were measured in skeletal muscle of rats with acute liver failure resulting from hepatic devascularization. Methods: Glutamine synthetase protein and gene expression were investigated using immunoblotting and semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis. Glutamine synthetase activity and glutamine de novo synthesis were measured using, respectively, a standard enzymatic assay and [C-13]-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Results: Glutamine synthetase protein (but not gene) expression and enzyme activities were significantly up-regulated leading to increased de novo synthesis of glutamine and increased skeletal muscle capacity for ammonia removal in acute liver failure. In contrast to skeletal muscle, expression and activities of glutamine synthetase in the brain were significantly decreased. Conclusions: These findings demonstrate that skeletal muscle adapts, through a rapid induction of glutamine synthetase, to increase its capacity for removal of blood-borne ammonia in acute liver failure. Maintenance of muscle mass together With the development of agents with the capacity to stimulate muscle glutamine synthetase could provide effective ammonia-lowering strategies in this disorder.

They result from a population of abnormally hyperactive and hypersynchronous neurons. It is not easy to determine the location of the cerebral generators and the other brain regions that may be involved as a result of this abnormal activity. The possibility to combine EEG recording with functional MRI (fMRI) scanning opens the opportunity to uncover the regions of the brain showing changes in the fMRI signal in response to epileptic spikes seen in the EEG. These regions are presumably involved in the abnormal neuronal activity at the origin of epileptic discharges. This paper reviews the methodology involved in performing such studies, particularly the challenge of recording a good quality EEG inside the MR scanner while scanning is taking place, and the methods required for the statistical analysis of the combined EEG and fMRI time series. We review the results obtained in patients with different types of epileptic disorders and discuss the difficult theoretical problems raised by the interpretation of an increase (activation) and decrease (deactivation) in blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal, both frequently seen in response to spikes.

Objective To determine the extent of regional medial temporal lobe atrophy, including hippocampus, amygdala, and entorhinal, perirhinal, and parahippocampal cortices in mild AD patients and healthy controls, and to compare diagnostic accuracy across volumetric markers. Methods We studied 34 patients with clinically probable AD and 22 healthy elderly control subjects. Regional volumetric measures were obtained from volumetric T1-weighted MRI scans after accounting for global brain atrophy using affine transformation into standard space. Results Volumes of medial temporal lobe structures were significantly smaller in AD patients than in controls with exception of the left entorhinal cortex. The degree of atrophy was comparable between all structures. Diagnostic accuracy (number of correctly allocated cases divided by number of all cases) was highest for the right parahippocampal cortex with 85%, but only slightly lower for the right hippocampus and right entorhinal cortex with 82% and 84%. Using a linear combination of markers, the unilateral volumes of the right hippocampus, parahippocampal cortex and perirhinal cortex yielded an accuracy of 93%. Conclusion Extent of atrophy is similar between the different regions of the medial temporal lobe in mild AD. Volume measurements of medial temporal lobe structures in addition to the hippocampus only yield improved diagnostic accuracy if a combination of these structures is used.

This has not been explored as extensively for arm movement-related neurons in posterior parietal cortex area 5. We recorded the activity of 78 proximal arm - related neurons in area 5 of two monkeys while they used their whole arm to make reaching movements toward eight targets on a horizontal plane against an inertial load or to generate isometric forces at the hand in the same eight horizontal directions. The overall range of measured output forces was similar in the two tasks. The forces increased monotonically in the desired direction in the isometric task. In the movement task, in contrast, they showed a rapid initial increase in the direction of movement, followed by a transient reversal of forces as the hand approached the target. Many task-related area 5 neurons were tuned for the direction of motor output in the tasks, but most area 5 neurons were more strongly active or exclusively active in the movement task than in the isometric task. Furthermore, their activity at either the single cell or population level did not reflect the transient reversal of output forces during movement. In contrast, M1 neuronal activity was typically strong in both tasks and showed task-related changes that reflected the differences in the time course and directionality of force outputs between both tasks, including the transient reversal of forces in the movement task. These results show that area 5 neurons are less strongly related to the time-course of task kinetics than M1 during isometric and arm-movement tasks.

Recent neuroimaging studies, however, have shown V1 modulations by the degree of structure in the image ( shape). These V1 modulations due to the level of shape coherence have been explained in one of two possible ways: due to changes in image statistics or shape-based perceptual influences from higher visual areas. Here we compare both hypotheses using stimuli composed of Gabor arrays constructed to form circular shapes that can be successively degraded by manipulating the orientations of individual Gabors while maintaining local and global statistics. In a first experiment, we confirm that V1 responses are inversely correlated with the degree of structure in the image. In a second experiment, stimulus predictions are compared based on the degree of circular shape or change in the image statistic varied ( orientation variance) in the image. We find that these V1 modulations to shape change are correlated with low-level changes in orientation contrast rather than shape perception per se.

Bilateral vestibular loss leads to active destabilization of balance during voluntary head turns in the standing cat	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article							CANAL-NECK INTERACTION; CENTRAL COMPENSATION; POSTURAL RESPONSE; VERTICAL PLANES; NEURONS; LABYRINTH; COORDINATION; STIMULATION; TRANSLATION; PERCEPTION	The purpose of this study was to determine the source of postural instability in labyrinthectomized cats during lateral head turns. Cats were trained to maintain the head in a forward orientation and then perform a rapid, large-amplitude head turn to left or right in yaw, while standing freely on a force platform. Head turns were biomechanically complex with the primary movement in the yaw plane accompanied by an ipsilateral ear-down roll and nose-down pitch. Cats used a strategy of pushing off by activating extensors of the contralateral forelimb while using all four limbs to produce a rotational moment of force about the vertical axis. After bilateral labyrinthectomy, the initial components of the head turn and accompanying postural responses were hypermetric, but otherwise similar to those produced before the lesion. However, near the time of peak yaw velocity, the lesioned cats produced an unexpected burst in extensors of the contralateral limbs that thrust the body to the ipsilateral side, leading to falls. This postural error was in the frontal ( roll) plane, even though the primary movement was a rotation in the horizontal ( yaw) plane. The response error decreased in amplitude with compensation but did not disappear. We conclude that lack of vestibular input results in active destabilization of balance during voluntary head movement. We postulate that the postural imbalance arises from the misperception that the trunk was rolling contralaterally, based on signals from neck proprioceptors in the absence of vestibular inputs.

All subjects were submitted to both a caffeine (200 mg) and placebo (lactose) condition in a double-blind cross-over design. The conditions were separated by 1 week. Compared with the placebo condition, the evening ingestion of caffeine lengthened sleep latency, reduced sleep efficiency, and decreased sleep duration and amount of stage 2 sleep in both age groups. Caffeine also reduced spectral power in delta frequencies in frontal, central and parietal brain areas, but not in prefrontal (PF) and occipital regions. Moreover, caffeine increased spectral power in beta frequencies in frontal and central brain areas in both age groups. A suppression of spectral power in the PF area in low delta frequencies (0.5-1.00 Hz) and a rise in spectral power in the parietal region in high alpha (10.00-12.00 Hz) and beta frequencies (17.00-21.00, 23.00-25.00, 27.00-29.00 Hz) occurred solely in middle-aged subjects. No such changes were noticeable in young subjects. Generally, caffeine produced similar effects in young and middle-aged subjects. Only a few frequency bins showed more effects of caffeine in middle-aged subjects compared with young subjects. Furthermore, sleep EEG results do not entirely support the hypothesis that caffeine fully mimics the effects of a reduction of homeostatic sleep propensity when following a normal sleep-wake cycle.

Methods: Seven hundred thirty-six patients who underwent coronary artery bypass surgery, valve replacement, or both between 1999 and 2002 were mailed questionnaires ( response rate, 79% [n = 579]; 564 questionnaires were analyzed), and their hospital records were reviewed. Results: Nonanginal chronic postoperative pain affected 23% of patients. Eighty percent of them had pain 1 or more days per week. The worst and usual pain intensities during the week preceding the survey reached moderate to severe levels ( >= 4/10) in more than half of the patients. Thirty-one percent of the patients with chronic postoperative pain had taken analgesic pain medication during that week. During the same period, pain interfered significantly ( >= 4/10) with various aspects of patients' daily life (eg, general activity level: 39.1%, sleep: 36.7%). When patients with and without chronic postoperative pain were compared, the former group had significantly higher levels of anxiety and depression, and they perceived their health-related quality of life as more compromised. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that greater analgesic needs in the first few days postoperatively were associated with an increased risk of chronic postoperative pain. The only other significant factor was the time elapsed from surgical intervention to survey: the longer it was, the less likely the patients were to report chronic postoperative pain. Conclusion: The prevalence, severity, and effect of chronic postoperative pain after cardiac surgery should not be underestimated. Longitudinal prospective studies are needed to further evaluate risk factors, including inadequate postoperative pain relief in the acute period.

Response rates for second-tine chemotherapy are 15-25%, with a median survival of 5 months. Caelyx, a pegylated liposomal formulation of doxorubicin, may be better tolerated and has activity in SCLC. Patients and methods: Thirty-two patients were enrolled in a phase II study of intravenous Caelyx (35 mg/m(2)), cyclophosphamide (750 mg/m(2)) and vincristine (1.2 mg/m(2)) every 21 days as second-line therapy in SCLC for up to six cycles. Results: Thirty patients were evaluable for response, with a response rate of 10%. Another two had an unconfirmed response. Stable disease (SD) for >= 2 cycles was seen in an additional 53%. Grade 3 or 4 non-hematologic toxicity was seen in 17 (55%) patients (26 [22%] cycles) and included fatigue, mucositis, plantar-palmar erythrodysesthesia, rash and neuropathy. Twelve patients required transfusions. All patients on study have now expired, with a median survival of 28 weeks (7 months). For patients with SD or partial response, median time to progression was 15 weeks. Conclusion: The combination of Caelyx, cyclophosphamide and vincristine, despite cyclophosphamide and Caelyx dose reductions, has modest activity in relapsed SCLC with acceptable toxicity.

Tyrosine kinase B receptor and its activated neurotrophins in ovaries from human fetuses and adults	MOLECULAR HUMAN REPRODUCTION			English	Article						immunohistochemistry; neurotrophins; primordial follicles; RT-PCR; TrkB receptor	HUMAN FETAL; FOLLICULAR DEVELOPMENT; MAMMALIAN OVARY; SURVIVAL; EXPRESSION; FOLLICLES; GROWTH; TISSUE; TRK	The signals initiating the growth of primordial follicles are unknown. Growth factors such as neurotrophin 415 (NT-4/5) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) may play a role in this process. To investigate the expression of NT-4/5 and BDNF and their receptor tyrosine kinase B (TrkB) in the early developing follicles, we fixed and froze 12 ovarian samples from adolescents/adults and 31 ovaries from human fetuses. The fixed samples were prepared for immunohistochemical staining for NT-4/5, BDNF and the TrkB receptor. Total RNA was extracted from the frozen ovarian samples, and the expression of NT-4/5, BDNF and the TrkB receptor (full length and two truncated isoforms) was investigated by RT-PCR. Products were resolved by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis and image analysis. Immunohistochemical staining revealed the expression of NT-4/5 and BDNF mainly in oocytes and, in a minority of samples, also in the granulosa cells (GCs); TrkB receptor was identified in oocytes and GCs. Transcripts of NT-4/5, BDNF and all forms of TrkB receptor were identified in the samples. To elucidate whether indeed NT-4/5 and BDNF are involved in growth initiation of human primordial follicles, they should be added to the culture medium.

Here we show in mice that the essential timing mechanism is programmed within individual progenitor cells, and its expression depends solely on cell-intrinsic and environmental factors generated within the clonal lineage. Multipotent progenitor cells undergo repeated asymmetric divisions, sequentially generating neurons in their normal in vivo order: first preplate cells, including Cajal-Retzius neurons, then deep and finally superficial cortical plate neurons. As each cortical layer arises, stem cells and neuroblasts become restricted from generating earlier-born neuron types. Growth as neurospheres or in co-culture with younger cells did not restore their plasticity. Using short-hairpin RNA (shRNA) to reduce Foxg1 expression reset the timing of mid- but not late-gestation progenitors, allowing them to remake preplate neurons and then cortical-plate neurons. Our data demonstrate that neural stem cells change neuropotency during development and have a window of plasticity when restrictions can be reversed.

First, we examined the effects of GJ blockers (i.e., carbenoxolone, octanol, quinine, and quinidine) on the spontaneous synchronous events (duration = 0.2-1.1 s; intervals of occurrence = 3-27 s) generated by neocortical slices obtained from temporal lobe epileptic patients during application of 4-aminopyridine (4AP, 50 mu M) and glutamatergic receptor antagonists. The synchronicity of these potentials (recorded at distances up to 5 mm) was decreased by GJ blockers within 20 min of application, while prolonged GJ blockers treatment at higher doses made them disappear with different time courses. Second, we found that slices from patients with focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) could generate in normal medium spontaneous synchronous discharges (duration = 0.4-8 s; intervals of occurrence = 0.5-90 s) that were (I) abolished by NMDA receptor antagonists and (ii) slowed down by carbenoxolone. Finally, octanol or carbenoxolone blocked 4AP-induced ictal-like discharges (duration = up to 35 s) in FCD slices. These data indicate that GJ play a role in synchronizing human neocortical networks and may implement epileptiform activity in FCD. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The neurosteroid, allopregnanolone, a positive allosteric modulator of GABA receptors, accumulates in the brains of HE patients where it can potentiate GABA(A) receptor-mediated responses. Attenuation of the effects of neurosteroids on GABA-ergic neurotransmission is therefore of interest for the management of HE. In the present study, we determined the effect of the benzodiazepine partial inverse agonist, Ro15-4513, and the benzodiazepine antagonist, flumazenil on modulation of the GABA(A) mediated chloride currents by allopregnanolone and on spontaneous synaptic activity in cultured hippocampal neurons using the patch-clamp technique. Allopregnanolone (0.03-0.3 mu M), dose-dependently potentiated GABA-induced currents, an action significantly reduced by Ro15-4513 (10 mu M). In contrast, flumazenil (10 mu M) had no effect on the ability of allopregnanolone to potentiate GABA(A) currents but it blocked the effects of Ro15-4513. The frequency of spontaneous synaptic activity was significantly reduced in the presence of allopregnanolone (0.1 mu M) from 1.5 +/- 0.7 to 0.1 +/- 0.04 Hz. This action was partially reversed by Ro15-4513 (10 mu M) but was not significantly influenced by flumazenil (10 mu M). These findings suggest that the beneficial affects of Ro15-4513 in experimental HE result from attenuation of the effects of neurosteroids at GABA(A) receptors. Our results may provide a rational basis for the use of benzodiazepine inverse agonists in the management and treatment of hepatic encephalopathy in patients with liver failure.

Global white matter brain tissue volume decreases were related to genetic risk factors for the disease. However, which focal gray and white matter brain regions best reflect the genetic and environmental risk factors in the brains of patients with schizophrenia remains unresolved. 1.5-T MRI brain scans of 11 monozygotic and 11 same-sex dizygotic twin-pairs discordant for schizophrenia were compared to 11 monozygotic and 11 same-sex dizygotic healthy control twin-pairs using voxel-based morphometry. Linear regression analysis was done in each voxel for the average and difference in gray and white matter density separately, in each twin-pair, with group (discordant, healthy) and zygosity (monozygotic, dizygotic) as between subject variables, and age, sex and handedness as covariates. The t-maps (critical threshold value \t\ > 6.0, P < 0.05) revealed a focal decrease in gray matter density accompanied by a focal increase in white matter density in the left medial orbitofrontal gyrus and a focal decrease in white matter density in the left sensory motor gyrus in twin-pairs discordant for schizophrenia as compared to healthy twin-pairs. Focal changes in left medial (orbito)frontal and left sensory motor gyri may reflect the increased genetic risk to develop schizophrenia. Focal changes in the left anterior hemisphere may therefore be particularly relevant as endophenotype in genetic studies of schizophrenia. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Several methods have been developed for the faithful reconstruction of surface models which represent the true cortical surface in both geometry and topology. However, there has been no explicit comparison study among those methods because each method has its own procedures, file formats, coordinate systems, and use of the reconstructed surface. There has also been no explicit evaluation method except visual inspection to validate the whole-cortical surface models quantitatively. In this study, we presented a novel phantom-based validation method of the cortical surface reconstruction algorithm and quantitatively cross-validated the three most prominent cortical surface reconstruction algorithms which are used in Freesurfer, BrainVISA, and CLASP, respectively. The validation included geometrical accuracy and mesh characteristics such as Euler number, fractal dimension (FD), total surface area, and local density of points. CLASP showed the best geometric/topologic accuracy and mesh characteristics such as FD and total surface area compared to Freesurfer and BrainVISA. In the validation of local density of points, Freesurfer and BrainVISA showed more even distribution of points on the cortical surface compared to CLASP. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The interpretation of moral transgressions and their affective consequences depends on whether the action is intentional or accidental, and whether one is the agent of or witness to the action. We used event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate whether the amygdala is involved in judging one's own moral violation of social norms. In this study, participants (n = 12) were asked to make evaluations regarding the degree of inappropriateness of social behaviours described in stories in which they themselves, or someone else, transgressed social norms either intentionally or accidentally. Consistent with our hypothesis, the amygdala was activated when participants considered stories narrating their own intentional transgression of social norms. This result suggests the amygdala is important for affective responsiveness to moral transgressions. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The analgesic interactions between anandamide (0.01 mu g), ibuprofen (0.1 mu g) and rofecoxib (0.1 mu g) or their combinations administered locally in the hind paw of neuropathic rats were investigated together with the effects of specific antagonists for the cannabinoid CB1 (AM251; 80 mu g) and CB2 (AM630; 25 mu g) receptors. Mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia were evaluated in 108 Wistar rats allocated to: (1-4) NaCl 0.9%; anandamide; ibuprofen; rofecoxib; (5-6) anandamide + ibuprofen or rofecoxib; (7-8) AM251 or AM630; (9-10) anandamide + AM251 or AM630; (11-12) ibuprofen + AM251 or AM630; (13-14) rofecoxib + AM251 or AM630; (15-16) anandamide + ibuprofen + AM251 or AM630; (17-18) anandamide + rofecoxib + AM251 or AM630. Drugs were given subcutaneously in the hind paw 15 min before pain tests. Anandamide, ibuprofen, rofecoxib and their combinations significantly decreased mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia with an ED50 of 1.6 +/- 0.68 ng and 1.1 +/- 1.09 ng for anandamide, respectively. The effects of NSAIDs were not antagonized by AM251 or AM630 but those of anandamide were inhibited by AM251 but not by AM630. In conclusion, locally injected anandamide, ibuprofen, rofecoxib and their combinations decreased pain behavior in neuropathic animals. Local use of endocannabinoids to treat neuropathic pain may be an interesting way to treat this condition without having the deleterious central effects of systemic cannabinoids.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of concussion on event-related potentials, in symptomatic as well as in asymptomatic athletes. METHODS: Twenty symptomatic and asymptomatic athletes who sustained a concussion were compared with 10 control athletes in a modified auditory Oddball task. The task included a sequence of tones containing standard and deviant stimuli. Participants were asked to respond to the target tone presented in the left ear and to ignore tones presented in the right ear. The electroencephalogram was recorded from 28 electrodes during the task. RESULTS: The results showed a reduction in the amplitude of N1, P2, and P3 components in symptomatic and asymptomatic athletes in comparison with control athletes. No between-group differences were observed in reaction times or in latency of the event-related potentials components, except for P3 latency, in which the controls showed shorter latency than the concussed groups. CONCLUSION: Concussions seem to produce deficits in the early and late stages of auditory information processing, which possibly reflect impaired brain functioning in symptomatic and asymptomatic concussed athletes. The fact that asymptomatic athletes have an electrophysiological profile similar to that of symptomatic athletes challenges the validity of return-to-play guidelines for which the absence of symptoms is a major issue.

J	Flatters, SJL; Bennett, GJ				Flatters, SJL; Bennett, GJ			Studies of peripheral sensory nerves in paclitaxel-induced painful peripheral neuropathy: Evidence for mitochondrial dysfunction	PAIN			English	Article						chemotherapy; pain; cancer; microtubule; degeneration; allodynia; hyperalgesia	TAXOL-INDUCED NEUROPATHY; PERMEABILITY TRANSITION PORE; LOCAL INJECTION; RAT; CELLS; TUBULIN; NEUROTOXICITY; DYNAMICS	Paclitaxel chemotherapy frequently induces neuropathic pain during and often persisting after therapy. The mechanisms responsible for this pain are unknown. Using a rat model of paclitaxel-induced painful peripheral neuropathy. we have performed studies to search for peripheral nerve pathology. Paclitaxel-induced mechano-allodynia and mechano-hyperalgesia were evident after a short delay, peaked at day 27 and finally resolved on day 155. Paclitaxel- and vehicle-treated rats were perfused on days 7.27 and 160. Portions of saphenous nerves were processed for electron microscopy. There was no evidence of paclitaxel-induced degeneration or regeneration as myelin structure was normal and the number/density of myelinated axons and C-fibres was unaltered by paclitaxel treatment at any time point. In addition, the prevalence of ATF3-positive dorsal root ganglia cells was normal in paclitaxel-treated animals. With one exception, at day 160 in myelinated axons. total microtubule densities were also unaffected by paclitaxel both in C-fibres and myelinated axons. C-fibres were significantly swollen following paclitaxel at days 7 and 27 compared to vehicle. The most striking finding was significant increases in the prevalence of atypical (swollen and vacuolated) mitochondria in both C-fibres (1.6- to 2.3-fold) and myelinated axons (2.4- to 2.6-fold) of paclitaxel-treated nerves at days 7 and 27. Comparable to the pain behaviour, these mitochondrial changes had resolved by day 160. Our data do not support a causal role for axonal degeneration or dysfunction of axonal microtubules in paclitaxel-induced pain. Instead. our data suggest that a paclitaxel-induced abnormality in axonal mitochondria of sensory nerves contributes to paclitaxel-induced pain.

This process is determined by several factors including the molecular weight of the compounds, their shape, degree of ionization, and binding to proteins. Accumulation of xenobiotics into tissues does not depend only on their ability to enter cells, but also on their ability to leave them. For instance, the role of efflux transporters such as ATP-binding cassette (ABC) proteins in the disposition of drugs is now well recognized. Actually, ABC transporters act in synergy with drug-metabolizing enzymes to protect the organism from toxic compounds. The most studied transporter from the ABC transporter superfamily, P-glycoprotein, was found to be overexpressed in tumor cells and associated with an acquired resistance to several anticancer drugs. P-glycoprotein, thought at first to be confined to tumor cells, was subsequently recognized to be expressed in normal tissues such as the liver, kidney, intestine, and heart. Even though information remains rather limited on the functional role of ABC transporters in the myocardium, it is hypothesized that they may modulate efficacy and toxicity of cardioactive agents. This review addresses recent progress on knowledge about the ABC transporters in drug disposition and more precisely their role in drug distribution to the heart.

J	Sorge, RE; Stewart, J				Sorge, Robert E.; Stewart, Jane			The effects of long-term chronic buprenorphine treatment on the locomotor and nucleus accumbens dopamine response to acute heroin and cocaine in rats	PHARMACOLOGY BIOCHEMISTRY AND BEHAVIOR			English	Article						buprenorphine; heroin; cocaine; dopamine; locomotion; microdialysis; tolerance; addiction	DELTA-OPIOID RECEPTORS; RHESUS-MONKEYS; MU; DEPENDENCE; METHADONE; MORPHINE; BRAIN; MICE; ADDICTION; RELEASE	We have previously shown that chronic treatment with the partial mu-opioid receptor agonist, buprenotphine, blocks the nucleus accumbens dopamine response to an acute injection of heroin, whereas it potentiates the response to an acute injection of cocaine after 4-5 days of treatment. Here we studied the effects of chronic exposure to buprenorphine via osmotic minipumps for up to 28 days (1.5 or 3.0 mg/kg/day) on responses to acute injections of heroin and cocaine. Increases in locomotion induced by heroin (0.25 mg/kg, sc), given on the 5th, 15th or 25th day of treatment were unaffected by buprenorphine, whereas increases induced by cocaine (20 mg/kg, ip) were enhanced early in treatment but not on the 15th or 25th days. Using in vivo microdialysis we found that both the suppression of the dopaminergic response in the nucleus accumbens to heroin and the potentiation to cocaine seen early in treatment diminished over the 26-27 days, whereas basal dopamine levels remained elevated throughout. Therefore, although these studies do not explain the mechanism whereby buprenorphine reduces heroin and cocaine intake, they do indicate that there is little tolerance to the presence of chronic buprenorphine.

They are responsible for human botulism and constitute a potential chemical weapon, but can also be used as a therapeutic agent. Sphincter bladder and prostatic injections have been described in urological indications as varied as detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia and neurogenic detrusor hyperactivity, idiopathic overactive bladder symptoms, interstitial cystitis, obstructive voiding disorders related to benign prostatic hyperplasia or chronic prostatitis, and recurrent urethral stricture. This review of the literature presents the results and level of evicence in support of the use of BT in urological indications. Detrusor injections of BT-A constitute an alternative conservative treatment that is effective in the short term (6-12 months) after failure of anticholinergic agents to treat neurogenic detrusor hyperactivity (level 1b). Sphincter injections are effective in the short-term treatment of neurogenic detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia (level le). The efficacy observed during preliminary clinical trials of detrusor injections of BTLA for idiopathic overactive bladder symptoms or interstitial cystitis (level 4) and prostatic injections for obstruction related to BPH (level 1c) justifies the major interest raised by this new therapeutic approach. However these preliminary results must be confirmed by comparative studies on a sufficient number of patients with long-term follow-up before considering the use of this technique in routine clinical practice.

The use of statistical models to predict the likely occurrence or distribution of species based on relevant variables is becoming an increasingly important tool in conservation planning and wildlife management. This article aims to provide an overview of the current status of development and application of statistical methodologies for analysing the species-environment association, with a clear emphasis on aquatic habitat. It describes the main types of univariate and multivariate techniques available for analysis of species-environment association, and specifically focuses on the assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of the available statistical methods to estimate habitat suitability. A second objective of this article is to propose new approaches using existing statistical methods. A wide array of habitat statistical models has been developed to analyse habitat-species relationship. Generally, physical habitat is dependent on more than one variable (e.g. depth, velocity, substrate, cover) and several suitability indices must be combined to define a composite index. Multivariate approaches are more appropriate for the analysis of aquatic habitat as they inherently consider the interrelation and correlation structure of the environmental variables. Ordinary multiple linear regression and logistic regression are popular methods often used for modelling of species and their relationships with environment. Ridge regression and Principal component regression are particularly useful when the independent variables are highly correlated. More recent regression modelling paradigms like generalized linear models (GLMs) present advantages in dealing with non-normal environmental variables. Generalized additive models (GAMs) and artificial neural networks are better suited for analysis of non-linear relationships between species distribution and environmental variables. The fuzzy logic approach presents advantages in dealing with uncertainties that often exist in habitat modelling. Appropriate methods for analysis of multi-species data are also presented. Finally, the few existing comparative studies for predictive modelling are reviewed, and advantages and disadvantages of different methods are discussed. Copyright (c) 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

In Drosophila, RPTPs are required for appropriate axon targeting during embryonic development. In contrast, deletion of any one of the three LAR-RPTP family members in mammals does not result in gross axon targeting defects. Both RPTP-sigma and RPTP-delta are highly expressed in the developing mammalian nervous system, suggesting they might be functionally redundant. To test this hypothesis, we generated RPTP-sigma and RPTP-delta ( RPTP-sigma/delta) double-mutant mice. Although embryonic day 18.5 RPTP-sigma and RPTP-delta single-mutant embryos were viable, RPTP-sigma/delta double mutants were paralyzed, were never observed to draw a breath, and died shortly after cesarean section. RPTP-sigma/delta double mutants exhibit severe muscle dysgenesis and severe loss of motoneurons in the spinal cord. Detailed analysis of the projections of phrenic nerves in RPTP-sigma/delta double mutants indicated that these motoneuron axons emerge normally from the cervical spinal cord, but stall on reaching the diaphragm. Our results demonstrate that RPTP-sigma and RPTP-delta complement each other functionally during mammalian development, and reveal an essential contribution of RPTP-sigma and RPTP-delta to appropriate motoneuron axon targeting during mammalian axonogenesis.

This inability may be related to a dysfunction of the neural circuitry underlying emotional self-regulation. This functional magnetic resonance imaging study was conducted to test this hypothesis. Depressed individuals and controls were scanned while they attempted to voluntarily down-regulate sad feelings. The degree of difficulty experienced during down-regulation of sadness was higher in depressed individuals. Furthermore, there was greater activation in the right dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, right anterior temporal pole, right amygdala, and right insula in depressed individuals. These results suggest that emotional dysregulation in major depressive disorder is related to a disturbance in the neural circuitry of emotional self-regulation.

In this study, we demonstrate that kainate (KA) ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs) require not only the neurotransmitter L-glutamate (L-Glu) but also external sodium and chloride ions for activation. Removal of external ions traps KA receptors (KARs) in a novel inactive state that binds L-Glu with picomolar affinity. Moreover, occupancy of KARs by L-Glu precludes external ion binding, demonstrating crosstalk between ligand- and ion-binding sites. AMPAi GluRs function normally in the absence of external ions, revealing that even closely related iGluR subfamilies operate by distinct gating mechanisms. This behavior is interchangeable via a single amino acid residue that operates as a molecular switch to confer AMPA receptor behavior onto KARs. Our findings identify a novel allosteric site that singles out KARs from all other ligand-gated ion channels.

J	Walczak, JS; Beaulieu, P				Walczak, JS; Beaulieu, P			Comparison of three models of neuropathic pain in mice using a new method to assess cold allodynia: The double plate technique	NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS			English	Article						cold allodynia; mice; neuropathic pain; double plate; acetone	NERVE INJURY; RAT MODEL; THERMOSENSATION; MONONEUROPATHY; DISORDERS	The recent identification of receptors sensitive to cold stimuli increased the significance of using mice to study cold allodynia, one of the important features of neuropathic pain. However, commonly used techniques (simple cold plate and acetone technique) may be inappropriate to study cold allodynia in mice because of problems of interpretation. We have developed a new method for assessing aversion to a cold non-noxious stimulus. It consists of calculating the time that mice spend on a non-noxious cold plate during their explorative behavior versus a thermoneutral one. We used three different models of neuropathic pain: chronic constriction injury of the sciatic nerve (M), partial sciatic nerve ligation (PSL) and chronic constriction of the saphenous nerve (CCS) with their respective sham groups and naive animals to assess the double plate in comparison to the acetone drop technique. All operated mice displayed cold allodynia with both methods. The response to acetone and the time spent on the cold plate were correlated (r = -0.93) and we also showed that the CCI mice were more sensitive to cold. Pharmacological validation of this technique showed that CCI induced cold allodynia was alleviated by gabapentin. In conclusion, the double plate technique provides a new, relevant method for assessing cold allodynia in mice. The advantages and drawbacks with the other techniques are discussed.

In mouse, contralateral RGCs are distributed throughout the retina, whereas ipsilateral RGCs are restricted to the ventrotemporal crescent (VTC). While repulsive guidance mechanisms play a major role in the formation of the ipsilateral projection, little is known about the contribution of growth-promoting interactions to the formation of binocular visual projections. Here, we show that the cell adhesion molecule Nr-CAM is expressed by RGCs that project contralaterally and is critical for the guidance of late-born RGCs within the VTC. Blocking Nr-CAM function causes an increase in the size of the ipsilateral projection and reduces neurite outgrowth on chiasm cells in an age- and region-specific manner. Finally, we demonstrate that EphB1/ephrin-B2-mediated repulsion and Nr-CAM-mediated attraction comprise distinct molecular programs that each contributes to the proper formation of binocular visual pathways.

It is uncertain whether methylxanthines have other short- and long-term benefits or risks in infants with very low birth weight. Methods: We randomly assigned 2006 infants with birth weights of 500 to 1250 g during the first 10 days of life to receive either caffeine or placebo, until drug therapy for apnea of prematurity was no longer needed. We evaluated the short-term outcomes before the first discharge home. Results: Of 963 infants who were assigned to caffeine and who remained alive at a postmenstrual age of 36 weeks, 350 (36 percent) received supplemental oxygen, as did 447 of the 954 infants (47 percent) assigned to placebo (adjusted odds ratio, 0.63; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.52 to 0.76; P < 0.001). Positive airway pressure was discontinued one week earlier in the infants assigned to caffeine (median postmenstrual age, 31.0 weeks; interquartile range, 29.4 to 33.0) than in the infants in the placebo group (median postmenstrual age, 32.0 weeks; interquartile range, 30.3 to 34.0; P < 0.001). Caffeine reduced weight gain temporarily. The mean difference in weight gain between the group receiving caffeine and the group receiving placebo was greatest after two weeks (mean difference, -23 g; 95 percent confidence interval, -32 to -13; P < 0.001). The rates of death, ultrasonographic signs of brain injury, and necrotizing enterocolitis did not differ significantly between the two groups. Conclusions: Caffeine therapy for apnea of prematurity reduces the rate of bronchopulmonary dysplasia in infants with very low birth weight. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00182312.).

A growing body of evidence indicates that glial cells are important modulators of synaptic functions, but very little is known about their role in heterosynaptic plasticity. We examined the role of glial cells in heterosynaptic depression, knowing that tetanization and NMDA application caused depression of synaptic field responses (fEPSPs) and induced Ca2+ rise in glial cells. Here we report that chelating Ca2+ in a glial syncytium interfered with heterosynaptic depression and NMDA-induced fEPSP depression, suggesting that Ca2+ activation of glial cells is necessary for heterosynaptic depression. The NMDA-induced Ca2+ rise in glial cells was sensitive to tetrodotoxin and reduced by the GABA(B) antagonist CGP55845. Both heterosynaptic depression and simultaneous Ca2+ activation of glial cells were prevented by CGP55845, suggesting an involvement of the GABAergic network in glial activation and heterosynaptic depression. Also, the GABAB agonist baclofen caused both a Ca2+ rise in glial cells and fEPSP depression. Heterosynaptic depression, as well as NMDA- and baclofen-induced depression, were attenuated by an A(1) antagonist, cyclopentyl-theophylline, whereas glial cell activation was not, indicating a role of adenosine downstream of glial activation. Finally, heterosynaptic depression requires ATP degradation because ectonucleotidase inhibitors reduced this plasticity. Our work indicates that Ca2+ activation of glial cells is necessary for heterosynaptic depression, which involves the sequential interaction of Schaffer collaterals, the GABAergic network, and glia. Thus, glial and neuronal networks are functionally associated during the genesis of heterosynaptic plasticity at mammalian central excitatory synapses.

Their motor performance was compared to that of 10 age/gender-matched non-dyskinetic patients (NDPD) and 10 healthy controls. Whole-body movement (WBM) and rapid alternating movements (RAM) at the wrist were recorded simultaneously using 6-degree of freedom magnetic motion tracker and forearm rotational sensors, respectively. WBM was recorded prior to, and while subjects performed pronation-supination movements of their dominant hand with maximal rotational excursion, and as fast as possible for 10s. RANGE, VELOCITY and IRREGULARITY of pronation-supination cycles were quantified to assess motor performance. Results show that DPD patients had greater WBM than NDPD and controls during rest and RAM performance, as expected. There were no differences in motor performance between DPD and NDPD groups for RANGE and VELOCITY, despite significantly longer disease duration for the DPD group (15.5 +/- 6.2 years versus 6.6 +/- 2.6 years). However, both the NDPD and DPD, groups showed significantly lower RANGE and reduced VELOCITY compared to controls, suggesting the presence of bradykinesia. For IRREGULARITY, DPD patients showed increased fluctuations in pronation-supination cycle amplitude compared to NDPD and controls. However, the lack of correlation between WBM magnitude and IRREGULARITY within the DPD group (Spearman's rank order, rho = 0.31, p > 0.05), suggests that LID were not the primary cause of increased IRREGULARITY. In conclusion, our results demonstrated that bradykinesia can coexist with dyskinesias, suggestive of distinct neural circuits. Our results also demonstrated that the occurrence of LID is not inevitably accompanied with worsening of motor performance. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

They are supposed to originate from cerebellar neural precursor cells. Recently, it has been shown that Sonic Hedgehog-induced formation of medulloblastoma in an animal model is significantly enhanced by activation of the phosphaticlylinositol 3'-kinase (PI3K) signaling pathway. Experimental Design: To examine a role for PI 3 K/AKT signaling in the molecular pathogenesis of human medulloblastoma,we did an immunohistochemical study of the expression of Ser(473) - phosphorylated (p)-AKT protein in 22 medulloblastoma samples: All samples displayed p-AKT expression. To investigate if an activated PI3K/AKT pathway is required for medulloblastoma cell growth, we treated five human medulloblastoma cell lines with increasing concentrations of the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 and analyzed cellular proliferation and apoptosis. The antiproliferative effect could be antagonized by overexpressing constitutively active AKT As the activation of PI 3 K/AKT signaling may be associated with alterations of the PTEN gene located at 10q23.3, a chromosomal region subject to frequent allelic losses in medulloblastoma, we screened PTEN for mutations and mRNA expression. Results: Proliferation of all of the medulloblastoma cell lines was dependent on PI3K/AKT signaling, whereas apoptosis was not prominently affected. Allelic loss was detected in 16% of the cases. One medulloblastoma cell line was found to carry a truncating mutation in the PTEN coding sequence. Even more important, PTEN mRNA and protein levels were found to be significantly lower in medulloblastomas compared with normal cerebellar tissue of different developmental stages. Reduction of PTEN expression was found to be associated with PTEN promoter hypermethylation in 50% of the tumor samples. Conclusions: We conclude that activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway constitutes an important step in the molecular pathogenesis of medulloblastoma and that dysregulation of PTEN may play a significant role in this context.

Simple computerized image processing of electron-micrographs provided the binary images of vesicular dense cores, whilst the artificial intelligence methods were needed to determine the vesicular membranes. As in the past, the presence of large, highly irregular vesicles, provided the morphological evidence of fused vesicles, but the irregularity of vesicular shape was assessed quantitatively-from its roundness. Free space of each vesicle was determined from the distance to its nearest-neighbor, or from the size of its Voronoi polygon. Within a Voronoi polygon, each point is closer to that vesicle than to any other vesicle. Large vesicles were not less round and did not have larger free space, as expected if they result from fusion of several smaller vesicles. In conclusion, we present a novel and rigorous morphological analysis of spatial and regional properties of dense core vesicles. The results demonstrate that the homotypic fusion is not prominent in PC-12 cells, before or following a chronic treatment that enhances release. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Nerve injury often leads to allodynia and hyperalgesia, which are symptoms of neuropathic pain. The aim of this study was to understand some molecular and electrophysiological mechanisms of neuropathic pain after chronic constriction of the saphenous nerve (CCS) in mice. After surgery, CCS mice displayed significant allodynia and hyperalgesia, which were sensitive to acute systemic injection of morphine (4 mg/kg), gabapentin (50 mg/kg), amitriptyline (10 mg/kg), and the cannabinoid agonist WIN 55,212-2 (5 mg/kg). These behavioral changes were accompanied after surgery by an increase of c-Fos expression and by an overexpression of p-opioid and cannabinoid CB, and CB2 receptors in the spinal cord and the dorsal hind paw skin. In combination with the skin-nerve preparation, this model showed a decrease in functional receptive fields downstream to the injury and the apparition of A-fiber ectopic discharges. In conclusion, CCS injury induced behavioral, molecular, and electrophysiological rearrangements that might help us in better understanding the peripheral mechanisms of neuropathic pain. This model takes advantage of the possible use in the future of genetically modified mice and of an exclusively sensory nerve for a comprehensive study of peripheral mechanisms of neuropathic pain.

We examined within- and across-language adaptation for spoken words in English-French bilinguals who had acquired their L2 after the age of 4 years. Subjects listened to words presented binaurally through earphones. In two control conditions (one for each language), six identical words were presented to obtain maximal adaptation. The remaining six conditions each consisted of five words that were identical followed by a sixth word that differed. There were thus a total of eight experimental conditions: no-change (sixth word identical to first five); a change in meaning (different final word in L1); a change in language (final item translated into L2); a change in meaning and language (different final word in L2). The same four conditions were presented in L2. The study also included a silent baseline. At the neural level, within- and across-language word changes resulted in release from adaptation. This was true for separate analyses of L1 and L2. We saw no evidence for greater recovery from adaptation in across-language relative to within-language conditions. While many brain regions were common to L1 and L2, we did observe differences in adaptation for forward translation (L1 to L2) as compared to backward translation (L2 to L1). The results support the idea that, at the lexical level, the neural substrates for L1 and L2 in bilinguals are shared, but with some populations of neurons within these shared regions showing language specific responses.

Pinealectomy has no effect on clock gene rhythms in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), the master circadian clock, as well as in the eyes and heart, indicating that the effect of melatonin on clock gene rhythms is tissue specific. To further study the role of melatonin in the regulation of the rhythm of clock genes, we assessed in rats the effect of pinealectomy on the rhythm of expression of the clock protein, PER2, in a number of key limbic forebrain structures, the oval nucleus of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST-OV), the central nucleus of the amygdala (CEA) and the hippocampus (HIPP). Despite previous evidence showing that these regions are sensitive to melatonin, pinealectomy had no effect on the daily rhythm of expression of PER2 within these structures, further supporting the view that the role of endogenous melatonin in the regulation of clock gene expression is tissue specific.

To address this issue, we incubated COS-7 cells expressing the rat NTS2 with neurotensin (NT) for up to 24 h and measured resultant cell Surface [I-125]-NT binding. We found that NTS2-expressing cells retained the same surface receptor density despite efficient internalization mechanisms. This preservation was neither due to NTS2 neosynthesis nor recycling since it was not blocked by cycloheximide or monensin. However, it appeared to involve translocation of spare receptors from internal stores, as NT induced NTS2 migration from trans-Golgi network to endosome-like Structures. This stimulation-induced regulation of cell surface NTS2 receptors was even more striking in rat spinal cord neurons. Taken together, these results suggest that sustained NTS2 activation promotes recruitment of intracellular receptors to the cell surface, thereby preventing functional desensitization.

We have previously proposed that this entails coordinate extracellular and intracellular interactions of its two subunits, alpha- and beta- DG. To assess the contribution of the extracellular and intracellular portions of DG, we have used adenoviruses to express full- length and deletion mutants of beta- DG in myotubes derived from wild- type embryonic stem cells or from cells null for DG. We show that alpha- DG is properly glycosylated and targeted to the myotube surface in the absence of beta- DG. Extracellular interactions of DG modulate the size and the microcluster density of agrin- induced acetylcholine receptor aggregates and are responsible for targeting laminin to these clusters. Thus, the association of alpha- and beta- DG in skeletal muscle may coordinate independent roles in signaling. We discuss how DG may regulate synapses through extracellular signaling functions of its alpha subunit.

We investigated in monkey whether orienting saccadic gaze shifts made in the dark with coordinated eye-head movements are controlled by feedback. We recorded from superior colliculus fixation neurons (SCFNs) that fired tonically during fixation and were silent during gaze shifts. When we briefly (<= 700 ms) interrupted gaze shifts by transiently braking head movements, SCFNs fired steadily during brake-induced gaze immobility, and their mean frequency was inversely related to the remaining distance between current gaze position and the target. After head release, a corrective gaze saccade brought gaze on the unseen goal, and SCFN firing frequency peaked. The results support gaze feedback control and show that the SC is part of a network that encodes, during orientation, the distance between eye and target, irrespective of gaze trajectory characteristics.

How our brain readily achieves such kinematically complex yet remarkably precise multijoint movements remains a fundamental and unresolved question in neuroscience. Many prevailing theoretical frameworks ensure multijoint coordination by means of integrative feedback control. However, to date, it has proven both technically and conceptually difficult to determine whether the activity of motor circuits is consistent with integrated feedback coding. Here, we tested this proposal using coordinated eye-head gaze shifts as an example behavior. Individual neurons in the premotor network that command saccadic eye movements were recorded in monkeys trained to make voluntary eye-head gaze shifts. Head-movement feedback was experimentally controlled by unexpectedly and transiently altering the head trajectory midflight during a subset of movements. We found that the duration and dynamics of neuronal responses were appropriately updated following head perturbations to preserve global movement accuracy. Perturbation-induced increases in gaze shift durations were accompanied by equivalent changes in response durations so that neuronal activity remained tightly synchronized to gaze shift offset. In addition, the saccadic command signal was updated on-line in response to head perturbations applied during gaze shifts. Nearly instantaneous updating of responses, coupled with longer latency changes in overall discharge durations, indicated the convergence of at least two levels of feedback. We propose that this strategy is likely to have analogs in other motor systems and provides the flexibility required for fine-tuning goal-directed movements.

We used two-dimensional electrophoresis, immunoblotting, and mass spectrometry to identify selective proteins targeted by HNE inside the diaphragm of rats under two conditions: severe sepsis [ induced by E. coli lipopolysaccharides (LPS)] and during strenuous muscle contractions elicited by severe inspiratory resistive loading (IRL). Diaphragm HNE-protein adduct formation (detected with a polyclonal antibody) increased significantly after 1 and 3 h of LPS injection with a return to baseline values thereafter. Similarly, HNE-protein adduct formation inside the diaphragm rose significantly after 6 but not 3 h of IRL. Mass spectrometry analysis of HNE-modified proteins revealed enolase 3b, aldolase and triosephosphate isomerase 1, creatine kinase, carbonic anyhdrase III, aconitase 2, dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase, and electron transfer flavoprotein-beta. Measurements of in vitro enolase activity in the presence of pure HNE revealed that HNE significantly attenuated enolase activity in a dose-dependent fashion, suggesting that HNE-derived modifications have inhibitory effects on enzyme activity. We conclude that lipid peroxidation products may inhibit muscle contractile performance through selective targeting of enzymes involved in glycolysis, energy production as well as CO2 hydration.

J	Chakfe, Y; Zhang, ZZ; Bourque, CW				Chakfe, Y; Zhang, ZZ; Bourque, CW			IL-1 beta directly excites isolated rat supraoptic neurons via upregulation of the osmosensory cation current	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY-REGULATORY INTEGRATIVE AND COMPARATIVE PHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						vasopressin; prostaglandin; EP4 receptor; osmosensitivity; neurohypophysis	MAGNOCELLULAR NEURONS; RECEPTOR ANTAGONIST; VASOPRESSIN NEURONS; OSMOTIC-PRESSURE; INTERLEUKIN-1-BETA; BRAIN; HYPOTHALAMUS; NUCLEUS; LIPOPOLYSACCHARIDE; CONDUCTANCE	Previous studies have shown that IL-1 beta can excite the magnocellular neurosecretory cells (MNCs) of the hypothalamus. However, it is not known whether IL-1 beta can have direct IL-1 receptor type 1 (IL-1R1)-mediated effects on MNCs, and little is known about the cellular mechanisms by which IL-1 beta influences electrical activity in these cells. Here, we used patch-clamp recordings to examine the effects of IL-1 beta on acutely isolated rat MNCs. We found that IL-1 beta directly excites MNCs in a dose-dependent manner and that this response can be blocked by an inhibitor of the IL-1R1. Voltage-clamp analysis of the current evoked by IL-1 beta revealed a linear current-voltage relationship between -90 and -20 mV, and a reversal potential near -35 mV. This value was not affected by reducing the concentration of chloride ions in the external solution, indicating the involvement of a nonselective cation conductance. The effects of IL-1 beta were inhibited by Na-salicylate, an inhibitor of cyclooxygenase. Moreover. the effects of IL-1 beta were mimicked and occluded by PGE(2), and were inhibited by AH-23848, an antagonist of the PGE(2) type 4 (i.e., EP4) receptor. The current evoked by IL-1 beta was also abolished by 100 mu M gadolinium (Gd3+), but was significantly larger when examined in cells preshrunk by negative pressure applied via the recording pipette. IL-1 beta alone did not cause changes in cell volume nor in the mechanosensitivity of MNCs. We conclude that IL-1 beta directly excites MNCs via an IL-1R1-mediated induction of PGE(2) synthesis and EP4 receptor-dependent autocrine upregulation of the nonselective cation conductance that underlies osmoreception.

J	Miresco, MJ; Kirmayer, LJ				Miresco, MJ; Kirmayer, LJ			The persistence of mind-brain dualism in psychiatric reasoning about clinical scenarios	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY			English	Article							OBJECTS; PEOPLE	Objective: Despite attempts in psychiatry to adopt an integrative biopsychosocial model, social scientists have observed that psychiatrists continue to operate according to a mind-brain dichotomy in ways that are often covert and unacknowledged and suggest that the same intuitive cognitive schemas that people use to make judgments of responsibility lead to dualistic reasoning among clinicians. The goal of this study was to confirm these observations. Method: Self-report questionnaires were sent to the 270 psychiatrists and psychologists in the Department of Psychiatry at McGill University. In response to clinical vignettes, the participants rated the level of intentionality, controllability, responsibility, and blame attributable to the patients, as well as the importance of neurobiological, psychological, and social factors in explaining the patients' symptoms. Results: A total of 136 faculty members (50.4%) responded, and 127 were included in the analysis. Factor analysis revealed a single dimension of responsibility regarding the patients' illnesses that correlated positively with ratings of psychological etiology and negatively with ratings of neurobiological etiology. Psychological and neurobiological ratings were inversely correlated. Multivariate analyses of variance supported these results. Conclusions: Mental health professionals continue to employ a mind-brain dichotomy when reasoning about clinical cases. The more a behavioral problem is seen as originating in "psychological" processes, the more a patient tends to be viewed as responsible and blameworthy for his or her symptoms; conversely, the more behaviors are attributed to neurobiological causes, the less likely patients are to be viewed as responsible and blameworthy.

The authors sought to determine how this dilemma is currently being played out in residency training programs, in which training directors must decide how best to integrate neuroscience teaching in a rapidly changing clinical landscape. Method: The authors surveyed U. S. and Canadian psychiatry residency training directors to characterize current and future trends in neuroscience education and to examine training directors' views on the relevance of neuroscience to clinical practice. Results: The amount of neuroscience in residency curricula has increased significantly over the past 5 years, and further increases are expected in each specific neuroscience content area examined. While most training directors agreed that training in neuroscience was important for all residents, even those becoming primarily psychotherapists, relevance to future (but not current) practice was consistently cited as a motivating factor. Conclusions: While psychiatric residency programs continue to increase the neuroscience content of their curricula, it remains unclear how this added training will influence clinical work. Reframing current practices, including psychotherapy, into a neuroscientific context may ultimately prove more useful to trainees.

J	Siau, C; Bennett, GJ				Siau, C; Bennett, GJ			Dysregulation of cellular calcium homeostasis in chemotherapy-evoked painful peripheral neuropathy	ANESTHESIA AND ANALGESIA			English	Article							CHANNEL; RAT; MITOCHONDRIA; NOCICEPTION; PACLITAXEL; HYPERALGESIA; MECHANISM; INJURY; MODEL	Paclitaxel and vincristine are chemotherapeutic drugs that often evoke along-lasting painful peripheral neuropathy. Using drugs that reduce intracellular or extracellular calcium ions (Ca2+), we investigated the hypothesis that impaired Ca2+ regulation contributes to die chemotherapy-evoked neuropathic pain syndrome. For comparison, we also tested rats with painful peripheral neuropathy caused by nerve trauma and to the antihuman immunodeficiency virus nucleoside analog 2',3'-dideoxycytidune (ddC). Normal naive (without neuropathy), paclitaxel-treated, and vincristine-treated rats received the following intrathecal injections: TMB-8 (46 nmol), Quin-2 (1.8 nmol), EGTA (0.7 mu mol), EGTA-AM (0.1 mu mol), and their vehicle controls. Chronic constriction injury (CCI) rats were examined after TMB-8 and Quin-2 injections, and ddC-treated rats were examined after receiving TMB-8. Mechano-allodynia and mechano-hyperalgesia were evaluated after each injection. Drug effects on heat hyperalgesia were also tested in CCI rats. All four Ca2+-reducing drugs significantly inhibited mechano-allodynia and mechano-hyperalgesia in the rats treated with paclitaxel, vincristine, or ddC, but no effects were seen in the CCI or naive rats. We conclude that a similar abnormality of cellular Ca2+ homeostasis contributes to the pain caused by paclitaxel, vincristine, and ddC, but not posttraumatic painful peripheral neuropathy.

Nerve stimulation can be at the hand or the wrist. We compared all these tests at both sites of stimulation. Rocuronium was given to 32 patients under sevoflurane anesthesia. The mechanomyographic adductor pollicis TOF ratio was measured at one extremity. In the other, stimulation was at the hand or the wrist, by random allocation, and the acceleromyographic TOF ratio was measured. During recovery, a blinded observer estimated tactile fade. The TOF fade became undetectable when mechanomyographic TOF ratio was (mean +/- SD) 0.31 +/- 0.15. For DBS, this threshold was 0.76 +/- 0.11. For 50-Hz tetanus, it was 0.31 +/- 0.15. For 100-Hz tetanus, it was 0.88 +/- 0.18, with a range of 0.14-1.00. These tactile responses were the same for hand and wrist stimulation. When acceleromyographic TOF ratio reached 1.0, the mechanomyographic TOF ratio was 0.89 +/- 0.06. With stimulation in the hand, acceleromyographic TOF ratio > 1.0 was less frequent than at the wrist. To exclude residual paralysis, TOF, DBS, and 50-Hz tetanus are inadequate, 100-Hz tetanus is unreliable, and acceleromyography performs best.

The impact of infusion on activation thresholds of immune cells was evaluated. Results: Preinfusion VLA-4 expression differed across immune cell subsets. Natalizumab significantly, albeit partially, diminished VLA-4 expression on circulating immune cells. Cell subsets were differentially affected. Treatment significantly decreased migratory capacity of immune cells, correlating well with changes in VLA-4 expression. Effects of a single dose were not saturating and did not persist through the monthly dose interval. Infusion effect varied across patients but was remarkably stable in individual patients, over multiple infusions. Treatment significantly modulated proliferative responses of immune cells. Interpretation: To our knowledge, we provide first proof of concept that natalizumab diminishes migratory capacity of immune cells. Our prospective study further shows that effects of therapy likely (1) differ for distinct immune cell subsets, (2) are not sustained over current dose interval, (3) have unique profiles in individual patients, and (4) include modulation of activation threshold of immune cells. Monitoring these parameters could be relevant to ongoing safety and efficacy considerations.

Methods: OA was surgically induced in dogs by sectioning the anterior cruciate ligament. OA dogs were divided into three groups and treated orally with ( a) placebo; (b) 15 mg/kg/day PD-0200347, or ( c) 90 mg/kg/day PD-0200347. The animals were killed 12 weeks after surgery. Cartilage specimens from femoral condyles and tibial plateaus were processed for immunohistochemistry. Specific antibodies against the phosphorylated form of PKC alpha, Ras, c-Raf, the MAP kinases Erk1/2, p38, JNK, and the transcription factors, CREB and Elk-1, were used. Results: Levels of all the tested signalling mediators were increased in the placebo treated ( OA) group compared with the normal group. PD-0200347 treatment significantly reduced the levels of the active forms of PKC alpha, c-Raf, Erk1/2, and Elk-1; however, the levels of the active forms of Ras, p38, JNK, and CREB were not affected by the PD-0200347 treatment. Conclusion: The action of PD-0200347 on OA chondrocytes is probably mediated through the inhibition of Erk1/2 activation via a Ras independent mechanism. This effect is associated with reduction of the activation of transcription factors such as Elk-1, which leads to the inhibition of the induction of the major catabolic factors involved in the degradation process of OA cartilage.

Surprisingly acute tryptophan depletion (ATD), a procedure known to reduce 5-HT neurotransmission carried out in remitted OCD patients on selective serotonin reuptake inbibitors (SSRIs) failed to worsen obsessive-compulsive (OC) symptoms. We hypothesized that the putative symptom exacerbation resulting from ATD would only be observed during symptom provocation but not at rest. Methods: Double-blind placebo-controlled ATD study conducted in 16 OCD patients with stable improvement under either SSRI (n = 8) or specialized cognitive behavior therapy alone (n = 8), coupled with gradual symptom provocation, performed 5 hours after drink ingestion. Results: Acute tryptophan depletion markedly reduced total and free plasma tryptophan levels but did not significantly increase obsessions or compulsions at rest or following symptom provocation. However, subjective distress in response to triggering situations was significantly higher during ATD; significant mood lowering was also present during ATD. Conclusions: These results are consistent with the view that relapses in OC core symptoms in remitted OCD patients may not depend solely on short-term changes in presynaptic 5-HT availability. In contrast to its apparent lack of effect on core OC symptoms, ATD affected the patients mood and distress level resulting from provocation.

However, a direct link between structure and function has not been clearly established. The present study investigates this issue by measuring the volume of the PT and HG on the MRI scans of epilepsy patients classified into three groups: left speech group (LSG; n = 20), right speech group (RSG; n = 11) and bilateral speech group (BSG; n = 13), as assessed by the intracarotid Sodium Amytal procedure. Additionally, an automatic voxel-based morphometry (VBM) analysis was performed to explore collateral structural asymmetries. Although leftward structural asymmetries were found in the PT, consistent with the literature, they did not relate to language lateralization. For HG we also replicated asymmetries favouring the left side; interestingly, three of the individuals within the RSG showed a strongly reversed asymmetry, but as a whole the structure-function relationship for HG was not obligatory. The VBM analysis revealed a grey-matter concentration difference in the posterior part of the inferior frontal gyrus (pars opercularis, corresponding functionally to Broca's area), which favoured the left hemisphere in the LSG, and the right hemisphere in the RSG. The findings suggest that this frontal cortical region bears a direct relationship to language lateralization, which may be related to use-dependent plasticity in patients with language reorganization.

Quantitative in vitro autoradiography was also performed on the lower thoracic spinal cord of both strains and Wistar rats using specific radioligands for NK-1 receptor ([I-125]HPP[Arg(3), Sar(9), Met (O-2)(11)]SP (3-11)) and NK-3 receptor ([I-125]HPP-Asp-Asp-Phe-N-MePhe-Gly-Leu-Met-NH2). 2 The NK-1 agonist [Sar(9), Met(O-2)(11)]SP (650 and 6500 pmol) decreased MAP and increased HR in WKY. The fall in MAP was blunted in SHR and substituted by increases in MAP (65-6500 pmol) and more sustained tachycardia. The NK-3 agonist senktide (6.5-65 pmol) evoked marked increases in MAP and HR (SHR >> WKY), yet this response was rapidly desensitized. Cardiovascular effects of [Sar(9), Met(O-2)(11)]SP (650 pmol) and senktide (6.5 pmol) were selectively blocked by the prior i.t. injection of LY303870 (NK-1 antagonist, 65 nmol) and SB235375 (NK-3 antagonist, 6.5 nmol), respectively. Antagonists had no direct effect on MAP and HR in both strains. 3 Densities of NK-1 and -3 receptor binding sites were significantly increased in all laminae of the spinal cord in SHR when compared to control WKY and Wistar rats. The dissociation constant was however not affected in SHR for both NK-1 (K-d = 2.5 nM) and NK-3 (K-d = 5 nM) receptors. 4 Data highlight an upregulation of NK-1 and -3 receptor binding sites in the thoracic spinal cord of SHR that may contribute to the hypersensitivity of the pressor response to agonists and to the greater sympathetic activity seen in this model of arterial hypertension.

The first studies of these founder effects were performed in large part by astute clinicians such as Andre Barbeau. In collaboration with others, he contributed greatly to the delineation of phenotypic subtypes of these conditions. As such, the following neurogenetic disorders were first identified in patients of FC origin: AOA2, ARSACS, HSAN2, RAB, and HMSN/ACC. We have Summarized our current knowledge of the main hereditary ataxias, spastic parapareses and neuropathies that are particular to the FC population. The initial genetic characterization of the more common and homogeneous of these diseases has been largely completed. We predict that the regional populations of Canada will allow the identification of new rare forms of hereditary ataxias, spastic parapareses and neuropathies, and contribute to the unravelling of the genetic basis of these entities.

Popularized as the Mozart Effect, this result gave rise to a scientific, social, and commercial craze. The present paper evaluates the validity of the Mozart Effect through the analysis of 26 studies pertaining to this question. Conflicting results emerged but the majority of studies weakens the validity of the Mozart Effect. Theoretical implications for cognitive neuropsychology are discussed. Social and commercial issues are also addressed from an ethical point of view.

Typically such tumors are ER-, HER2- and express cytokeratin 5/6, cytokeratin 8/18, EGFR and vimentin. These characteristics can be used to predict which breast cancers are most likely to be associated with germline BRCA1 mutations which has important implications for breast pathologists. Moreover, BRCA1-related breast cancers generally have a poorer prognosis which may paradoxically be more pronounced in node negative cancers. This may relate in part to a different pattern of metastatic spread with in increased frequency of brain and lung metastases in BRCA1 carriers. Conversely, BRCA1-related tumors may respond better to neoadjuvant chemotherapy and their characteristic molecular signature may provide opportunities to develop specific molecular targeted therapies akin to traztuzumab in HER2+ cancers. Finally, many of the phenotypic features of BRCA1-related tumors might also be found in putative breast stem cells and therefore characterization of the BRCA1 breast cancer phenotype will improve our understanding of sporadic breast carcinogenesis.

In this historical review, we describe how the evolution of fundamental concepts in endocrinology and in hormone assay technology have faceted the laboratory as we know it today. The discovery of neurohormones, hormone receptors and the evolution of the concept of free hormones had a very significant impact on our understanding of the mechanisms of hormone action in health and disease and therefore on how physicians currently prescribe endocrine tests. In the analytical field, modem hormone assays rapidly replaced crude colorimetric methods and bioassays. Starting with the pioneering work of Yalow and Berson, hormone assays have gradually evolved through improvements in all aspects of assay design. This is best exemplified by the evolution of thyroid and parathyroid hormone assays. After reviewing some of the limitations of actual hormone immunoassays, we present some reflections on what the future of the hormone laboratory may look like considering all the developments in automation, point-of-care testing, molecular biology and array technologies.

Correlations of hippocampal atrophy and focal low-frequency magnetic activity in Alzheimer disease: volumetric MR imaging-magnetoencephalographic study. Am J Neuroradiol. 2003 24(3):481-487]. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that such a relationship does exist not only in AD patients but also across the continuum of subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD. Methods: Resting, eyes-closed EEG data were recorded in 34 MCI and 65 AD subjects. EEG rhythms of interest were delta (2-4 Hz), theta (4-8 Hz), alpha 1 (8-10.5 Hz), alpha 2 (10.5-13 Hz), beta 1 (13-20 Hz), and beta 2 (20-30 Hz). EEG cortical sources were estimated by LORETA. Cortical EEG sources were correlated with MR-based measurements of lobar brain volume (white and gray matter). Results: A negative correlation was observed between the frontal white matter and the amplitude of frontal delta sources (2-4 Hz) across MCI and AD subjects. Conclusions: These results confirmed for the first time the hypothesis that the sources of resting delta rhythms (2-4 Hz) are correlated with lobar brain volume across MCI and AD subjects. Significance: The present findings support, at least at group level, the 'transition hypothesis' of brain structural and functional continuity between MCI and AD.

J	Peretz, I				Peretz, Isabelle			The nature of music from a biological perspective	COGNITION			English	Review						musical capacity; innateness; specificity; brain; modules; universals; predispositions; emotions	PURE WORD DEAFNESS; RIGHT-HEMISPHERE DAMAGE; CONGENITAL AMUSIA; AUDITORY AGNOSIA; CORTICAL REPRESENTATION; LANGUAGE DISORDER; INHERITED SPEECH; BRAIN ACTIVITY; TONE-DEAFNESS; PITCH	Music, as language, is a universal human trait. Throughout human history and across all cultures, people have produced and enjoyed music. Despite its ubiquity, the musical capacity is rarely studied as a biological function. Music is typically viewed as a cultural invention. In this paper, the evidence bearing on the biological perspective of the musical capacity is reviewed. Related issues, such as domain-specificity, innateness, and brain localization, are addressed in an attempt to offer a unified conceptual basis for the study of music processing. This scheme should facilitate the study of the biological foundations of music by bringing together the fields of genetics, developmental and comparative research, neurosciences, and musicology.

The first publication on the EEG in 1929 by the German psychiatrist Hans Berger was met with skepticism. Substantial work in this area did not start before the public demonstration of the EEG by the British neurophysiologist Edgar Douglas Adrian in 1934. Soon afterwards, many groups specialized in the new method, particularly in the US, whereas interest remained more limited in France and Britain. A comparative analysis of the rise of electroencephalography has certainly to account for such national differences, but the trajectory of the implementation of this technology calls for an investigation of local research cultures in order to identify units of productivity and to understand the dynamics along this trajectory.

J	Ombao, H; Ho, MHR				Ombao, H; Ho, MHR			Time-dependent frequency domain principal components analysis of multichannel non-stationary signals	COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS & DATA ANALYSIS			English	Article						multivariate locally stationary time series; principal components analysis; time-varying eigenvalues and eigenvectors; time-varying spectral density matrix	SERIES; EXTRACTION	High dimensional multi-channel signals often exhibit multi-collinearities. This suggests that such signals can be decomposed into uncorrelated principal components with possibly lower dimension than that of the original signal. A time-localized frequency domain principal components analysis method is proposed for signals that exhibit locally stationary behavior. The first step is to form a mean square consistent estimate of the time-varying spectrum matrix by smoothing the time-localized periodograms using a kernel defined on the frequency axis whose span is selected automatically using a generalized cross-validation procedure that is based oil the asymptotic gamma distribution. The eigenvalues of the spectral density estimate are then computed which are the estimated spectra of the principal components. In addition, one may apply a formal statistical procedure for testing whether the weights (components of an eigenvector) at a particular channel change over time. The proposed method can be easily implemented because it only requires the fast Fourier transform (FFT) and eigenvalue-eigenvector decomposition routines. An illustration is presented using a multi-channel brain waves data set recorded during an epileptic seizure. (c) 2005 Published by Elsevier B.V.

As a consequence, development of new therapies in this area has largely focused on idiopathic urinary incontinence. The absence of data for patients with neurological disease has far-reaching implications, affecting reimbursement and physicians' willingness to prescribe therapies, and limiting access of potential valuable treatments to patients whose lives are significantly impaired by inadequately managed bladder symptoms. Scope: The range of new therapies is increasing. Although many reviews of the overall safety, efficacy and mode of action of such treatments are available, there is limited information on how these treatments will best be used in clinical practice. We considered the current benefits and limitations of the various new licensed and unlicensed therapies and what role each would have in the future management of neurogenic urinary incontinence. Conclusions: A wide range of new treatments have been investigated for the management of overactive bladder; few, however, have been evaluated extensively in neurogenic urinary incontinence. Further studies are required to determine the optimal dosing regimes and formulations for individual sub-populations of neurogenic bladder patients and to determine the cost-effectiveness of these interventions. With the current experience available, two treatment algorithms for a subset of patients with neurological disease have also been proposed, which suggest at which stage of management and in which patients individual therapies for neurogenic urinary incontinence could be used.

J	Stip, E				Stip, E.			Cognition, schizophrenia and the effect of antipsychotics	ENCEPHALE-REVUE DE PSYCHIATRIE CLINIQUE BIOLOGIQUE ET THERAPEUTIQUE			French	Article						antipsychotics; clozapine; cognition; ecological validity of testing; executive function; olanzapine; procedural learning; risperidone; schizophrenia; SSTICS; subjective complaints	DOUBLE-BLIND; IN-VITRO; OLANZAPINE; RISPERIDONE; HALOPERIDOL; CLOZAPINE; MEMORY; ATTENTION; DRUGS; TRIAL	Background. In this review, we conclude that. cognitive impairments are as important as positive and negative symptoms in the clinical assessment and management of patients with schizophrenia. This is not a comprehensive review, considering that the new Measurement And Treatment Research. to improve Cognition In Schizophrenia (MATRICS) Model will soon provide valuable data. It is however a product of the collective efforts of a French Canadian clinical research team that proposes a synthesis of data of pragmatic interest to clinicians. Medication with improved safety,and cognition profile, generally lead to better outcomes by facilitating compliance with drug regimens and rehabilitation programs, In addition measures of attention and executive function (EF) appear to improve with novel antiosychptics when compared to traditional neuroleptics. Nevertheless, evaluating cognitive performance is not a routine procedure outside the domain of research. For example, procedural learning (PL) - an important measure of cognitive function refers to cognitive and motor learning processes in which execution strategies cannot be explicitly described (ie learning by doing). These actions or procedures are then progressively learned through trial and error until automation of optimal performance is established, Procedural learning is rarely assessed in clinical practice. Inconsistent findings regarding the effects of neuroleptic drugs on PL have been reported. Literature findings. rials using acute administration of chlorpromazine in normal subjects induced PL deficits, suggesting the direct effect of neuroleptics, presumably via a D-2 dopamine blockade in the striatum. In a recant study by our group, schizophrenia patients, divided into three groups according to their pharmacological treatment (haloperidol, clozapine and risperidone) were compared to normal controls on two PL tasks; a visuomotor learning task (mirror drawing) and a problem solving learning task (Tower of Toronto). No deficits were detected in patients receiving dozapine, while haloperidol was associated with deleterious effects in both tasks. Risperidone, however, produced different effects depending on the task performed. Another 6-month double-blind Canadian study confirmed the beneficial effect of olanzapine on PL compared to haloperidol and risperidone. The differential effects of drugs on the striatal D-2 receptors, irrespective of their classification as conventional or atypical neuroleptics and the specific process implicated in each of these PL tasks may explain these results. Tracer studies using radioactive benzamides (IBZM) specific to striatal D receptors determined, a relationship between striatal D2 receptor occupancy and PL performance such as the mirror drawing task. Using this method, data obtained in Montreal on schizophrenia patients receiving olanzapine and haloperidol have shown that the coefficient of determination in a visumotor PL task varied inversely with D-2 receptor saturation. Discussion. This review probes the effect of impaired cognitive functions on schizophrenia patients' quality-of-life. Cognitive deficits found in schizophrenia affect planning, along with the aptitude to initiate and regulate a goal-directed behaviour. These impairments have been repeatedly, yet inconclusively, attributed to frontal lobe dysfunction. Morphological findings obtained from neuroimaging studies remain inconsistent, some noting no differences between patients and controls while others observing reduced prefrontal volumes in schizophrenia paients. Conversely, functional neuroimaging (fMRI). demonstrated reduced frontal blood flow relative to global cerebral perfusion in schizophrenia patients. Overall, neuroimaging literature provides reliable evidence of frontal impairments in schizophrenia, although the average magnitude of difference between patients and controls is insufficient to defend a frontal lobe dysfunction hypothesis, as far as brain volume, resting cerebral metabolism or blood flow are concerned. The only measurement clearly distinguishing between patients and controls is WRI of the frontal lobe while performing an experimentally controlled task. Here, schizophrenia patients fail to activate their frontal cortex when required. Sensitive to frontal lobe dysfunction are Neuropsychological tests of executive function. Study design. A study conducted in Montreal assessed the relation between EF impairments and difficulties in planning daily activities in schizophrenia patients scoring more than 3 on at least 4 items of the PANSS negative subscale. Performances on EF, memory and script generation were measured and compared to controls.. Script production task required that subjects recite 10-20 actions that would normally be carried out for during daily life activity (going to a restaurant, buying groceries, etc.). Patients' performances were significantly lower with higher perserveration and sequencing impairments. Routine activities such as the ability to cook a meal were similarly investigated. Patients were videotaped in a kitchen while preparing a specific meal. Results. Optimal sequence of micro- and macro-steps necessary to prepare the meal in a minimal time were measured. Sequencing errors, repetitions and omissions were significantly higher compared to controls. In addition, temporal organization was positively correlated with negative symptoms and low EF performance on neuropsychological tasks. Thus concluding that EF impairment interferes with basic routine activities in schizophrenia patients, notably those with negative symptoms. Last but not least, we assessed the progress of patients' subjective complaints with regards to their cognitive functions using tests such as the SSTICS, specifically developed to address subjective cognitive complaints and insight Conclusion. This review concludes that from now on cognitive deficit should be recognized as a major element in social and professional integration of schizophrenia patients, and should become a standardized assessment approach in clinical practice.

J	Lepage, JF; Theoret, H				Lepage, JF; Theoret, H			EEG evidence for the presence of an action observation-execution matching system in children	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						action observation; children; mirror neurons; motor cortex; mu rhythm	MIRROR-NEURON SYSTEM; PRIMARY MOTOR CORTEX; BIOLOGICAL MOTION; PREMOTOR CORTEX; HUMAN IMITATION; HUMAN INFANTS; ALPHA-RHYTHM; MU-RHYTHM; FACILITATION; PERCEPTION	In the adult human brain, passive observation of actions performed by others activates some of the same cortical areas that are involved in the execution of actions, thereby contributing to action recognition. This mechanism appears to occur through activation of a population of action-coding cells known as mirror neurons (MN). In the adult motor cortex, performing actions and observing human movement reduces the magnitude of the mu (8-13 Hz) rhythm, possibly reflecting MN system activity. Despite the wealth of information available regarding the adult MN system, little is known about its existence in children. Here, we used EEG to probe mu rhythm modulation in 15 children during observation and execution of hand actions. Our data show that mu rhythm attenuation occurs in children under 11 years old during observation of hand movements. Similarly to what has been reported in adults, observation of goal/object-orientated movement produces greater modulation of the mu rhythm than intransitive movement. These data confirm the existence of an observation-execution matching system in the immature human brain and may be of clinical value in the understanding of neurodevelopmental disorders associated with a faulty MN system, such as autism spectrum disorder.

This strategy allowed us to determine the impact of interfering with Ca2+/CaM-based signaling in dystrophin-deficient slow myofibers. Consistent with impairments in the Ca2+/CaM-regulated enzymes calcineurin and Ca2+/CaM-dependent kinase, the nuclear accumulation of nuclear factor of activated T-cell c1 and myocyte enhancer factor 2C was reduced in slow fibers from mdx/CaMBP mice. We also detected significant reductions in the levels of peroxisome proliferator gamma co-activator 1 alpha and GA-binding protein alpha mRNAs in slow fiber-rich soleus muscles of mdx/CaMBP mice. In parallel, we observed significantly lower expression of myosin heavy chain I mRNA in mdx/CaMBP soleus muscles. This correlated with fiber-type shifts towards a faster phenotype. Examination of mdx/CaMBP slow muscle fibers revealed significant reductions in A-utrophin, a therapeutically relevant protein that can compensate for the lack of dystrophin in skeletal muscle. In accordance with lower levels of A-utrophin, we noted a clear exacerbation of the dystrophic phenotype in mdx/CaMBP slow fibers as exemplified by several pathological indices. These results firmly establish Ca2+/CaM-based signaling as key to regulating expression of A-utrophin in muscle. Furthermore, this study illustrates the therapeutic potential of using targets of Ca2+/CaM-based signaling as a strategy for treating Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Finally, our results further support the concept that strategies aimed at promoting the slow oxidative myofiber program in muscle may be effective in altering the relentless progression of DMD.

The extraction of MUAP templates is carried out using a symbolic representation of waveforms, a common technique in signature verification applications. The assignment of MUAPs to their specific trains is achieved by means of repeated template matching passes using pseudocorrelation, a new matched-filter-based similarity measure. Identified MUAPs are peeled off and the residual signal is analyzed using shortened templates to facilitate the resolution of superimpositions. The program was tested with simulated data and with experimental signals obtained using fine-wire electrodes in the biceps bracbii during isometric contractions ranging from 5% to 30% of the maximum voluntary contraction. Analyzed signals were made of up to 14 MUAP trains. Most templates were extracted automatically, but complex signals sometimes required the adjustment of 2 parameters to account for all the MUAP trains present. Classification accuracy rates for simulations ranged from an average of 96.3% +/- 0.9% (4 trains) to 75.6% +/- 11.0% (12 trains). The classification portion of the program never required user intervention. Decomposition of most 10-s-long signals required less than 10 s using a conventional desktop computer, thus showing capabilities for real-time applications.

An added benefit with magnetic resonance is the ability to screen the central nervous system for findings which may adversely affect the neurodevelopmental outcome of these children. Objective: To determine the proportion of cases and significance of associated intracranial abnormalities as detected by central nervous system high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging in children with profound sensorineural hearing loss. Methods: Retrospective chart review of children undergoing evaluation for cochlear implantation in a tertiary care academic children's hospital with high-resolution magnetic resonance of the temporal bone and brain during a 21 month period. Magnetic resonance studies were interpreted by an experienced senior neuroradiologist blinded to the identity and clinical data of the patients. Results: Forty patients were identified. All had the same magnetic resonance study consisting of a 3D high-resolution sequence through the temporal bone as well as a T1 sagittal and T2 axial screening sequence of the brain. Eight patients (20%) showed significant brain abnormalities by magnetic resonance imaging ranging from myelination delays to migrational anomalies. Temporal bone abnormalities were not seen. Three patients with Connexin-26 mutations had no associated brain abnormalities by magnetic resonance. Conclusions: A significant proportion of our patients being investigated by magnetic resonance imaging for profound sensorineural hearing toss show migrational abnormalities of the central nervous system, suggesting a central origin to their hearing loss. Some of these findings may result in neurodevelopmental delay and hence, negatively impact the success of cochlear implantation.

Methods: 316 children who participated in the Multimodal Treatment Study of Children with ADHD (MTA) completed the Conners' Continuous Performance Test (CPT) at the 24-month assessment point. Outcome measures included standard CPT outcomes (e.g., errors of commission, mean hit reaction time (RT)) and RT indicators derived from an Ex-Gaussian distributional model (i.e., mu, sigma, and tau). Results: Analyses revealed significant effects of medication across all neuropsychological outcome measures. Results on the Ex-Gaussian outcome measures revealed that stimulant medication slows RT and reduces RT variability. Conclusions: This demonstrates the importance of including analytic strategies that can accurately model the actual distributional pattern, including the positive skew. Further, the results of the study relate to several theoretical models of ADHD.

To better understand the evolution of this gene superfamily, I compared all Cys-loop LGICs from rat, the primitive chordate Ciona intestinalis, Drosophila, and C. elegans. There are two clades of GABA receptor subunits that include both verterbate and invertebrate orthologues. In addition, I identified nine clades of anion channel subunits found only in invertebrates, including three that are specific to C. elegans and two found only in Drosophila. One well-defined clade of vertebrate cation channel subunits, the alpha 7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunits (nAChR), includes invertebrate orthologues. There are two clades of invertebrate nAChRs, one of alpha-type subunits and one of non-alpha subunits, that are most similar to the two clades of vertebrate neuronal and muscle alpha and non-alpha subunits. There is a large group of divergent C. elegans nAChR-like subunits partially resolved into clades but no orthologues of 5HT3-type serotonin receptors in the invertebrates. The topology of the trees suggests that most of the invertebrate-specific Cys-loop LGIC clades were present in the common ancestor of chordates and ecdysozoa. Many of these disappeared from the chordates. Subsequently, selected subunit genes expanded to form large subfamilies.

They are astounding in both number and kind. Authors cite papers that do not exist, or that exist but are absolutely irrelevant to, or even occasionally argue against, the point they are cited to support; or they attribute a statement to the wrong source, sometimes to a person who has vehemently and persistently argued against it. Obvious errors are quoted for years by numerous authors who have not read the original paper, until somebody blows the whistle-and even then, some persevere. As Darwin [Darwin, C. (1872).

Increasing use of genetic models including transgenic knockout mice and inbred strains of rodents has raised our awareness of, and the importance of, thorough characterization (or phenotyping) of the strains of rodents being compared. Furthermore, genetic variability in analgesic sensitivity is correlated with, and may be caused by, genetically determined baseline sensitivity. Thus in this study, baseline inflammatory and thermal nociceptive sensitivities were measured in awake male and female Lewis and Fischer rats to examine whether the results could explain relevant strain differences reported in the literature. The effect of maternal separation was also examined and no effect was found on nociceptive sensitivity, corticosterone responses, or the development of adjuvant-induced arthritis, a model of rheumatoid arthritis. Lewis rats and female rats were more sensitive to thermal nociception in the tail withdrawal test (mean of 3 trials) than Fischer rats and male rats, respectively. Unexpectedly, the more inflammation-susceptible Lewis rats were less sensitive in the formalin inflammatory nociception test, and showed a significant decrease in sensitivity with repeated thermal nociceptive testing, whereas Fischer rats did not. These results affect the interpretation of previously observed results. Further study of the underlying mechanisms and the relevance to differential susceptibility to chronic inflammation is warranted.

During phasic bursts, action potentials ( spikes) are superimposed on plateau potentials that are generated by summation of depolarizing after-potentials (DAPs). Burst termination is believed to result from autocrine feedback inhibition of plateau potentials by the kappa-opioid peptide, dynorphin, which is copackaged in vasopressin neurosecretory vesicles and exocytosed from vasopressin cell dendrites during phasic bursts. Here we tested this hypothesis, using intracellular recording in vitro to show that kappa-opioid receptor antagonist administration enhanced plateau potential amplitude to increase postspike excitability during spontaneous phasic activity. The antagonist also increased postburst DAP amplitude in vitro, indicating that endogenous dynorphin probably reduces plateau potential amplitude by inhibiting the DAP mechanism. However, the kappa-opioid receptor antagonist did not affect the slow depolarization that follows burst termination, suggesting that recovery from endogenous kappa-opioid inhibition does not contribute to the slow depolarization. We also show, by extracellular single-unit recording, that that there is a strong random element in the timing of burst initiation and termination in vivo. Administration of a kappa-opioid receptor antagonist eliminated the random element of burst termination but did not alter the timing of burst initiation. We conclude that dendritic dynorphin release terminates phasic bursts by reducing the amplitude of plateau potentials to reduce the probability of spike firing as bursts progress. By contrast, dendritic dynorphin release does not greatly influence the membrane potential between bursts and evidently does not influence the timing of burst initiation.

Here we investigated the signaling cascades that control fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2)-mediated retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axon extension in vivo. For this purpose, a novel adeno-associated virus (AAV) was used to deliver the FGF-2 gene to RGCs, providing a sustained source of this neurotrophic factor. FGF-2 gene transfer led to an approximately ten-fold increase in the number of axons that extended past the lesion site compared with control nerves. Axon growth correlated with FGF-2-induced activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 (Erk1/2), but not phosphoinositide 3-kinase or protein kinase C. Pharmacological inhibition of Erk1/2 activation resulted in an similar to 80% decrease in the number of axons that regenerated in the injured optic nerve. Our data demonstrate that the Erk1/2 pathway is an essential signaling component in FGF-2-mediated axon regeneration in the mature, injured visual system. (c) 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

In the present study, alteration of kinin B-1 and B2R after closed head trauma (CHT) and in vivo binding properties of Anatibant Ms (3 mg/kg, s.c.) injected 30 min after CHT were studied in mice by autoradiography using the radioligands [I-125]HPP-Hoe 140 (B2R), and [I-125]HPP-des-Arg(10)-Hoe 140 (B1R). Whereas B1R is barely detected in most brain regions, B2R is extensively distributed, displaying the highest densities in the hindbrain. CHT was associated with a slight increase of B1R and a decrease of B2R (10-50%) in several brain regions. Anatibant Ms (Ki = 22 pM) displaced the B2R radioligand from its binding sites in several areas of the forebrain, basal ganglia and hindbrain. Displacement was achieved in 1 h and persisted at 4 h post-injection. The inhibition did not exceed 50% of the total specific binding in non-injured mice. After CHT, the displacement by Anatibant Ms was higher and almost complete in the cortex, caudate putamen, thalamus, hippocampus, medial geniculate nucleus, ventral tegmental area, and raphe. Evans blue extravasation in brain tissue at 4 h after CHT was abolished by Anatibant Ms. It appeared that Anatibant Ms penetrated into the brain in sufficient amounts, particularly after disruption of the blood-brain barrier, to account for its B2R-mediated neuro- and vascular protective effects. The diminished binding of B2R after CHT may reflect the occupancy or internalization of B2R following the endogenous production of bradykinin (BK).

The role of sodium channels in chronic inflammatory and neuropathic pain	JOURNAL OF PAIN			English	Review						allodynia; hyperalgesia; inflammatory pain; local anesthetics; neuropathic pain; sodium channels	DORSAL-ROOT GANGLION; PRIMARY SENSORY NEURONS; RESISTANT NA+ CURRENT; SPINAL NERVE INJURY; PRIMARY AFFERENT NEURONS; MEMBRANE-POTENTIAL OSCILLATIONS; GUINEA-PIG CORNEA; LOCAL-ANESTHETIC INHIBITION; COMPLETE FREUNDS-ADJUVANT; DRG NEURONS	Clinical and experimental data indicate that changes in the expression of voltage-gated sodium channels play a key role in the pathogenesis of neuropathic pain and that drugs that block these channels are potentially therapeutic. Clinical and experimental data also suggest that changes in voltage-gated sodium channels may play a role in inflammatory pain, and here too sodium-channel blockers may have therapeutic potential. The sodium-channel blockers of interest include local anesthetics, used at doses far below those that block nerve impulse propagation, and tricyclic antidepressants, whose analgesic effects may at least partly be due to blockade of sodium channels. Recent data show that local anesthetics may have pain-relieving actions via targets other than sodium channels, including neuronal G protein-coupled receptors and binding sites on immune cells. Some of these actions occur with nanomolar drug concentrations, and some are detected only with relatively long-term drug exposure. There are 9 isoforms of the voltage-gated sodium channel alpha-subunit, and several of the isoforms that are implicated in neuropathic and inflammatory pain states are expressed by somatosensory primary afferent neurons but not by skeletal or cardiovascular muscle. This restricted expression raises the possibility that isoform-specific drugs might be analgesic and lacking the cardiotoxicity and neurotoxicity that limit the use of current sodium-channel blockers. Perspective: Changes in the expression of neuronal voltage-gated sodium channels may play a key role in the pathogenesis of both chronic neuropathic and chronic inflammatory pain conditions. Drugs that block these channels may have therapeutic efficacy with doses that are far below those that impair nerve impulse propagation or cardiovascular function.

We aimed to analyze the ATV injury patterns at our institution to help structure public awareness campaign and encourage governmental regulation, with the ultimate goal of injury prevention. Methods: A retrospective review of all ATV-related admissions at a pediatric trauma center was performed. Results: From 2001 to 2004, 50 ATV-related injuries requiting hospital admission were identified. The annual incidence had increased 2.5-fold from 2001 (8 admissions) to 2004 (20 admissions). The ages ranged from 3 to 17 years (median, 13 years), with equal sex distribution. Fifty-four percent of admissions were traumatic brain injuries, 28% had orthopedic injuries, 14% with facial fractures, and 4% with abdominal injuries. Average length of stay was 6 days (range, 1-47 days); 5 of the 7 intensive care unit admissions occurred in 2004. Eighty-four percent of patients did not wear helmet (97% among those from northern communities). Conclusions: Both the incidence and severity of ATV-related injuries are increasing in a regional pediatric trauma center. There is a lack of regulation enforcement and public awareness of the danger of ATV use in children. Efforts to ensure helmet use and limit operator age are urgently needed to reduce childhood ATV-related injuries. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Al-Barqawi, H; Zayed, T				Al-Barqawi, H; Zayed, T			Condition rating model for underground infrastructure sustainable water mains	JOURNAL OF PERFORMANCE OF CONSTRUCTED FACILITIES			English	Article						models; water distribution systems; infrastructure; underground structure; rehabilitation		One of the greatest challenges facing municipal engineers is the condition rating of buried infrastructure assets, particularly water mains. This is because water mains are typically underground, operated under pressure, and usually inaccessible. Condition rating is a mandatory process to establish and employ management strategies for any asset. To assess the condition of water mains, current research considers physical, environmental, and operational factors and their effect on different types of mains (i.e., cast iron, ductile iron, and asbestos). A condition rating model is developed to assess and set up rehabilitation priority for water mains using the artificial neural network (ANN) approach. Data are collected from different municipalities to train the developed model. The ANN input factors incorporate pipe type, size, age, breakage rate, Hazen-Williams factor, excavation depth, soil type, and top road surface; however, the output is pipe condition. The trained ANN shows robust performance (learning rate=0.005. R-2=0.931, correlation coefficient r=0.9653). Results show that the breakage rate has the highest relative contribution factor among the others. The developed model is relevant to researchers and practitioners (municipal engineers, consultants, and contractors) in order to prioritize pipe inspection and rehabilitation planning for existing water mains.

RBD can cause sleep disruption and severe injuries for the patient or bed partner. The disorder is strongly associated with neurodegenerative diseases, such as multiple-system atrophy, Parkinson's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, and progressive supranuclear palsy. In many cases, the symptoms of RBD precede other symptoms of these neurodegenerative disorders by several years. Furthermore, several recent studies have shown that RBD is associated with abnormalities of electroencephalographic activity, cerebral blood flow, and cognitive, perceptual, and autonomic functions. RBD might be a stage in the development of neurodegenerative disorders and increased awareness of this could lead to substantial advances in knowledge of mechanisms, diagnosis, and treatment of neurodegenerative disorders.

M. (1999). Science, 283, 77-80], and generalizes to examples both outside and inside of the range of training sentences. Knowledge-representation analyses confirm that these networks discover that duplicate words in the sentences are nearly identical and that they use this near-identity relation to distinguish sentences that are consistent or inconsistent with a familiar grammar. Recent simulations that were claimed to show that this model did not really learn these grammars [Vilcu, M., & Hadley, R. F. (2005). Minds and Machines, 15, 359-382] confounded syntactic types with speech sounds and did not perform standard statistical tests of results.

However, their ability to transfer electrons and holes to biomolecules leads to spectral changes and effects on living systems that have yet to be exploited. Here we report the first cell-based biosensor based on electron transfer between a small molecule ( the neurotransmitter dopamine) and CdSe/ZnS QDs. QD-dopamine conjugates label living cells in a redox-sensitive pattern: under reducing conditions, fluorescence is only seen in the cell periphery and lysosomes. As the cell becomes more oxidizing, QD labelling appears in the perinuclear region, including in or on mitochondria. With the most-oxidizing cellular conditions, QD labelling throughout the cell is seen. Phototoxicity results from the creation of singlet oxygen, and can be reduced with antioxidants. This work suggests methods for the creation of phototoxic drugs and for redox-specific fluorescent labelling that are generalizable to any QD conjugated to an electron donor.

However, studies aimed at elucidating the pathophysiological consequences of these changes in gene expression are impeded by the lack of a suitable mouse model of ALF. A previous report described hepatic pathology characteristic of ALF resulting from the administration of azoxymethane (AOM) in mice [Matkowskyj, K.A., Marrero, J.A., Carroll, R.E., Danilkovich, AX, Green, R.M, Benya, RX, 1999. Azoxymethane-induced fulminant hepatic failure in C57BL/6J mice: characterization of a new animal model. Am. J. Physiol. 277, G455-G462]. In a series of experiments to further assess this treatment as an effective model of ALF, the effects of administration of AOM to male C57BL mice on hepatic and cerebral function were studied. With maintenance of body temperature at 37 degrees C and control of hypoglycemia. mice developed signs of encephalopathy (decreased locomotor activity followed by loss of righting and corneal reflexes) within 16 h of AOM treatment. AOM-treated mice were hyperammonemic, developed spontaneous hypothermia and brain edema. Brain ammonia concentrations were increased to 0.98 +/- 0.12 mM at coma stages of encephalopathy. Brain amino acid profiles determined by HPLC were typical of ALF in other species including humans. Mild hypothermia (35 degrees C) led to significant attenuation of brain edema, ammonia, and amino acid changes. These findings demonstrate that AOM treatment affords a simple, reproducible mouse model of ALF which may be suitable for the study of the effects of gene manipulation on the cerebral complications of ALF.

Despite a growing interest in this technique, the precise relationship between its results and the actual regions of activated cortex is not clear. In this study, we have quantified for the first time the concordance between EEG-fMRI results and stereotaxic EEG (SEEG) recordings in 5 patients with partial epilepsy. We also compared fMRI and SEEG with other non-invasive maps based on scalp EEG alone. We found that SEEG measures largely validated the results of EEG and fMRI. Indeed, when there is an intracranial electrode in the vicinity of an EEG or fMRI peak (in the range 20-40 mm), then it usually includes one active contact. This was the case for both increases ('activations') and decreases ('deactivations') of the fMRI signal: in our patients, fMRI signal decrease could be as important in understanding the complete picture of activity as increase of fMRI signal. The concordance between EEG and fMRI was not as good as the concordance between either of these non-invasive techniques and SEEG. This shows that the two techniques can show different regions of activity: they are complementary for the localization of the areas involved in the generation of epileptic spikes. Moreover, we found that the sign of the fMRI response correlated with the low frequency content of the SEEG epileptic transients, this latter being a reflection of the slow waves. Thus, we observed a higher proportion of energy in the low frequencies for the SEEG recorded in regions with fMRI signal increase compared to the regions with fMRI signal decrease. This could reflect an increase of metabolism linked to the presence of slow waves, which suggests that fMRI is a new source of information on the mechanisms of spike generation.

We here tested the hypothesis that the human brain would process a putative social chemosignal, the endogenous steroid androstadienone, faster than other odorants with perceptually matched intensity and hedonic characteristics. Chemosensory event-related potentials (ERP) were recorded in healthy women. ERP analyses indicate that androstadienone was processed significantly faster than the control odorants. Androstadienone elicited shorter latencies for all recorded ERP components but most so for the late positivity. This finding indicates that androstadienone is processed differently than other related odorants, suggesting the possibility of a specific neuronal subsystem to the main olfactory pathway akin to the one previously reported in Old-world monkeys and emotional visual stimuli in humans.

Only two cases of manganism had been reported to the Commission de la sante et de la securite du travail (CSST, Workers Compensation Board in Quebec) before 2000. In the fall of 200 1, the CSST was informed of a possible cluster of manganism and received 20 compensation claims from one plant. Action was rapidly taken to understand and tackle this emerging problem. Under the leadership of the CSST, a coordinating working group implemented medical and environmental subcommittees involving representatives of the different partners of the prevention network. After a literature review to document the health risks associated with manganese and the lack of some important information, a panel of international experts was formed to try to reach agreement on the parameters to consider in the diagnosis and management of manganism. The CSST compensation management policies would be adjusted accordingly. Simultaneously, all the available industrial hygiene data were analyzed to estimate where and at what levels workers were exposed to manganese. To complete these data, the exposure of workers in more than 50 industrial plants was evaluated and existing control measures were documented. All these data have been presented for a revision of the Quebec permissible exposure limit (PEL). In this integrated approach, the next step targets the formation of neurologists and neuropsychologists for a standardized medical evaluation, to complete workplace evaluation in the high risk sectors, inform workers and employers and recommend control measures where required, based on a revised PEL. Many strategies will be used to inform the prevention network (about 1000 people), employers and employees of the risks of overexposure to manganese and of the measures to control exposure in all the plants where workers are susceptible to be exposed to manganese.

Monoamine oxidase (MAO; EC 1.4.3.4) regulates biogenic amine concentration in the brain and peripheral tissue and has been shown to be a molecular target of Hg compounds in animal models. Blood platelet monoamine oxidase-B (MAO-B) activity may reflect MAO function in the central nervous tissue. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the relationship between platelet MAO-B and Hg exposure in fish-eating adults (n = 127) living along the St. Lawrence River (Lake St. Pierre, Que., Canada). Hg concentrations were determined in blood and hair samples. A significant negative association was observed between platelet MAO-B activity and blood-Hg (r = -0.193, p = 0.029) but not with hair-Ha levels (r = -0.125, p = 0.169). Multiple linear regression analysis demonstrated that blood-Hg (beta = -4.6, p = 0.011) and heavy smoking (beta = -8.5. p = 0.00 1) were associated with reduced platelet MAO activity in the total population. In addition, this reduction in MAO-B activity appeared to be associated with blood-Hg concentrations above 3.4 mu g/L (75th percentile). Possible gender related differences were also observed and are discussed. Our results suggest that MAO-B activity in blood platelets may be a useful tool to assess biochemical effects of Ha exposure in human populations. These changes in platelet MAO-B may reflect enzymatic changes in nervous tissue and should be further investigated as a surrogate marker of neurotoxicity. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

It is one of the pediatric small round blue cell tumors, characterized by strong membrane expression of CD99 in a chain-mail pattern and negativity for lymphoid (CD45), rhabdomyosarcoma (myogenin, desmin, actin) and neuroblastoma (neurofilament protein) markers. Pathognomonic translocations involving the ews gene on chromosome 22 and an ets-type gene, most commonly the ffi1 gene on chromosome 11, are implicated in the great majority of cases. Clinical presentation is usually dominated by local bone pain and a mass. Imaging reveals a technetium pyrophosphate avid lesion that, on plain radiograph, is destructive, diaphyseal and classically causes layered periosteal calcification. Magnetic resonance best defines the extent of the lesion. Biopsy should be undertaken by an experienced orthopedic oncologist. Approximately three quarters of patients have initially localized disease. About two thirds survive disease-free. Management, preferably at a specialist center with a multi-disciplinary team, includes both local control-either surgery, radiation or a combination-and systemic chemotherapy. Chemotherapy includes cyclic combinations, incorporating vincristine, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, etoposide, ifosfamide and occasionally actinomycin D. Topotecan in combination with cyclophosphamide has shown preliminary activity. Patients with initially metastatic disease fare less well, with about one quarter surviving. Studies incorporating intensive therapy followed by stem cell infusion show no clear benefit. New approaches include anti-angiogenic therapy, particularly since vascular endothelial growth factor is an apparent downstream target of the ews-fli1 oncogene.

Posttraumatic pseudoaneurysm of the intracavernous internal carotid artery presenting with massive epistaxis	PEDIATRIC CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE			English	Article							TRAUMATIC PSEUDOANEURYSM; ANEURYSM; DIAGNOSIS; BLINDNESS; THERAPY	Objectives: To report a case of posttraumatic pseudoaneurysm of the intracavernous internal carotid artery presenting with massive epistaxis and to discuss its pathophysiology and management. Design. Case report and literature review. Setting. Pediatric intensive care unit in a tertiary-care center. Patients and Results: Twelve days after a motor vehicle accident causing a head injury and facial fractures, this patient presented with massive epistaxis due to a pseudoaneurysm of the intracavernous internal carotid artery. Nasal packing was performed and subsequent angiography demonstrated the vascular lesion that had dissected into the sphenoid sinus. Endovascular stent and coil occlusion of the vascular lesion was performed, and the patient's condition improved without any ischemic or thromboembolic sequelae. Conclusion. Posttraumatic aneurysms of the intracavernous internal carotid artery can be associated with delayed and sometimes lethal massive epistaxis. This vascular lesion should be considered in patients with traumatic brain injury presenting with basal skull fractures in the region of the carotid canal or cavernous sinus and/or orbital fractures and compromise of the optical nerves. Knowledge of these risk factors and early diagnosis can minimize the high mortality risk.

Since leucine levels are usually not immediately available during therapy, an accurate kinetic model of leucine plasma levels during removal would be useful to establish the duration of ECRT. Such a kinetic model is available for neonates undergoing continuous ECRT (CECRT) with a leucine clearance >= 35 ml min(-1) 1.73 m(-2). The current study tests the validity of this model in older children. Plasma leucine levels were obtained from eleven ECRT sessions [seven CECRT and four intermittent hemodialysis (HDi) sessions] in seven children aged 1-14 years. No hemodynamic instability or neurological complications were observed during treatment. HDi provided a higher leucine clearance and required shorter sessions than CECRT (5.4 +/- 0.6 vs. 17.1 +/- 6.0 h). All patients regained precrisis neurological status except for one patient who had severe neurological damage (severe cerebral edema) at the time of dialysis and subsequently died despite efficient leucine removal. A leucine clearance >= 50 ml min(-1) 1.73 m(-2) is required to obtain a kinetic model similar to that reported in neonates, both with CECRT and HDi. This model should be helpful in predicting the duration of therapy needed to attain desired leucine levels.

The aim of this study was to quantify the amplitude of diaphragm electrical activity present during expiration in mechanically ventilated infants and to measure the impact of removing positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) on this activity. We studied the EAdi in 16 ready-to-be weaned intubated infants who were breathing on their prescribed ventilator and PEEP settings. In all 16 patients, 5 min of data were collected on the prescribed ventilator settings. In a subset of eight patients, the PEEP was briefly reduced to zero PEEP (ZEEP). EAdi was recorded with miniaturized sensors placed oil a conventional nasogastric feeding tube. Airway pressure (Paw) was also measured. For each spontaneous breath, we identified the neural inspiration and neural expiration. Neural expiration was divided into quartiles (Q1, Q2, Q3. and Q4), and the amplitude of EAdi calculated for each Q1-Q4 represented 95 +/- 29%, 31 +/- 15%, 15 +/- 8%, and 12 +/- 7%, respectively, of the inspiratory EAdi amplitude. EAdi for Q3-Q4 significantly increased during ZEEP, and decreased after reapplication of PEEP. These findings confirm that the diaphragm remains partially active during expiration in intubated and mechanically ventilated infants and that removal of PEEP affects this tonic activity. This Could have potential implications on the management of PEEP in intubated infants.

We investigated whether these regimes could be augmented with blood-brain barrier permeable drugs, N and D. Noscapine is an opioid antitussive, which acts anti cancer via blocking microtubule dynamics. Diltiazem is a calcium channel-blocking cardiac antiarrythmic, which also blocks tumor growth and P-glycoprotein. Methods: Effects of N (11.1 mu mol/L), D (11.1 mu mol/L), and T (11.7 mu mol/L) were monitored in C6 glioma cells via S phase, colony formation, and fine structure analysis. Results: Taxol depleted S phase from 35.2% to 12.2%. Both N and D synergistically augmented T-mediated S-phase depletion, and they also effectively reduced colonies, which were more potent by N by 49%. Taxol reduced colonies by 98%, and there were almost no surviving colonies in copresence of T with either N or D. Colony reduction by radiotherapy was increased strongly by T and significantly by N. Taxol and radiation profoundly increased number of mitochondria. Both D and N suppressed this increase via myelinosis and autophagy. Conclusion: Noscapine and D should be further tested in animal models because of their potential and already-present clinical applicability. (c) 2006 Published by Elsevier Inc.

Some of these models follow the approach of developmental cognitive neuroscience in exploring interactions between brain development and cognitive development by integrating structural change into learning. We describe two classes of these models. The first focuses on experience-dependent structural elaboration within a brain region by adding or deleting units and connections during learning. The second models the gradual integration of different brain areas based on combinations of experience-dependent and maturational factors. These models provide new theories of the mechanisms of cognitive change in various domains and they offer an integrated framework to study normal and abnormal development, and normal and impaired adult processing.

For H2O, a simple NN approach works very well. To fit surfaces for HOOH and H2CO, we develop a nested neural network technique in which we first fit an approximate NN potential and then use another NN to fit the difference of the true potential and the approximate potential. The root-mean-square error (RMSE) of the H2O surface is I cm(-1). For the 6-D HOOH and H2CO surfaces, the nested approach does almost as well attaining a RMSE of 2 cm(-1). The quality of the NN surfaces is verified by calculating vibrational spectra. For all three molecules, most of the low-lying levels are within 1 cm(-1) of the exact results. On the basis of these results, we propose that the nested NN approach be considered a method of choice for both simple potentials, for which it is relatively easy to guess a good fitting function, and complicated (e.g., double well) potentials for which it is much harder to deduce an appropriate fitting function. The number of fitting parameters is only moderately larger for the 6-D than for the 3-D potentials, and for all three molecules, decreasing the desired RMSE increases only slightly the number of required fitting parameters (nodes). NN methods, and in particular the nested approach we propose, should be good universal potential fitting tools.

Independent groups of male rats were injected on four occasions, every other day (training phase), with vehicle or one of two doses (4 and 8 mg/kg) of the NMDA antagonist CPP [(+/-)-3-(2-carboxypiperazine-4-yl)prop anephosphonic)] followed by an intracerebroventricular injection of 18 nmol/10 mu l of D-Tyr[(11)]neurotensin, or its vehicle. Ambulatory, non-ambulatory and vertical movements were measured for 2 h on every test day. One week after the last day of the training phase, locomotor responses to a single injection of cocaine (7.5 mg/kg, ip) were measured in all rats; a second cocaine challenge test was performed 3 weeks post-training. Results show that during the training phase D-Tyr[(11)]neurotensin produced an initial suppression of all locomotor responses followed by an augmentation of ambulatory and non-ambulatory activity compared to controls, effects that were only slightly altered by CPP. Cocaine produced higher ambulatory and non-ambulatory activity in animals pre-exposed to neurotensin than in the vehicle pre-exposed animals, a sensitization effect that was not prevented by CPP at 1 week post-training but that was blocked at 3 weeks at the high dose. When given alone, the low dose of CPP produced an effect very similar to that of neurotensin on cocaine sensitization. These results further confirm that neurotensin plays a role in sensitization to psychostimulant drugs and suggests that NMDA receptors are involved in the long-term effect of exposure to neurotensin.

Naive rats as well as rats with unilateral axotomy of the sciatic nerve or unilateral inflammation of the hindpaw were analyzed. In naive rats, numerous Gall mRNA-positive (+) neurons were detected in lamina (L) I-III. In addition, several Gal(1) mRNA(+) neurons were seen in deeper layers, including the ventral horns, area X, and the lateral spinal nucleus. In contrast, few and comparatively weakly labeled Gal(2) mRNA(+) neurons were observed, mostly in the ventral horns and in area X, with fewer in the dorsal horn and in the sympathetic and parasympathetic intermediate lateral cell columns. Axotomy induced a strong increase in intensity and number of Gal(2) mRNA(+) motoneurons ipsilateral to the lesion. In contrast, nerve cut or hindpaw inflammation did not alter the expression of Gal(1) or Gal(2) in the dorsal horn. The present (and previous) results suggest that galanin, acting through Gal(1) and Gal(2) receptors, has a modulatory role on spinal excitability, not only via interneurons in superficial dorsal horn, but also on neurons in deep layers and area X, as well as on the sympathetic and parasympathetic outflow. Furthermore, the nerve injury-induced Gal(2) upregulation in motor neurons suggests a role for galanin in survival/regeneration mechanisms. (c) 2006 Published by Elsevier B.V.

This converting protease cascade and its endogenous regulators (including tissue plasminogen activator, plasminogen, neuroserpin, precursor matrix metalloproteinase 9, and tissue inhibitor metalloproteinase 1) are colocalized in neurons of the cerebral cortex and released upon neuronal stimulation. We also provide evidence that this mechanism operates in in vivo conditions, as the CNS application of inhibitors of converting and degrading enzymes lead to dramatic alterations in the tissue levels of either precursor NGF or mature NGF. Pathological alterations of this cascade in the CNS might cause or contribute to a lack of proper neuronal trophic support in conditions such as cerebral ischemia, seizure and Alzheimer's disease or, conversely, to excessive local production of neurotrophins as reported in inflammatory arthritis pain.

Most of their functions have been attributed to activation of the kinase-active Trk receptors and the p75 neurotrophin receptor. Truncated Trk receptor isoforms lacking the kinase domain are abundantly expressed during development and in the adult; however, their function and signaling capacity is largely unknown. We show that the neurotrophin-3 (NT3) TrkCT1-truncated receptor binds to the scaffold protein tamalin in a ligand-dependent manner. Moreover, NT3 initiation of this complex leads to activation of the Rac1 GTPase through adenosine diphosphate-ribosylation factor 6 (Arf6). At the cellular level, NT3 binding to TrkCT1-tamalin induces Arf6 translocation to the membrane, which in turn causes membrane ruffling and the formation of cellular protrusions. Thus, our data identify a new signaling pathway elicited by the kinase-deficient TrkCT1 receptor. Moreover, we establish NT3 as an upstream regulator of Arf6.

Rats received four intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections of 2 mg/kg paclitaxel on alternate days which, following a short delay induced marked mechanical hypersensitivity. Daily administration of ALC (50 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg; p.o.; concurrently with paclitaxel and for 14 days afterwards) prevented the development of paclitaxel-induced pain. This effect was long lasting, for at least 3 weeks after the last dose of ALC. In a separate experiment, daily administration of ALC (100 mg/kg; p.o.; for 10 days) to rats with established paclitaxel-induced pain produced an analgesic effect. This effect dissipated shortly after ALC treatment was withdrawn. We conclude that ALC may be useful in the prevention and treatment of chemotherapy-induced painful peripheral neuropathy.

In the present study, we examined changes in the cutaneous innervation in rats with a chronic constriction injury to the sciatic nerve. At several periods postinjury, hind paw skin was harvested and processed by using a monoclonal antibody against dopamine-beta-hydroxylase to detect sympathetic fibers and a polyclonal antibody against calcitonin gene-related peptide to identify peptidergic sensory fibers. We observed migration and branching of sympathetic fibers into the upper dermis of the hind paw skin, where they were normally absent. This migration was first detected at 2 weeks, peaked at 4-6 weeks, and lasted for at least 20 weeks postlesion. At 8 weeks postlesion, there was a dramatic increase in the density of peptidergic fibers in the upper dermis. Quantification revealed that densities of peptidergic fibers 8 weeks postlesion were significantly above levels in sham animals. The ectopic sympathetic fibers did not innervate blood vessels but formed a novel association and wrapped around sprouted peptidergic nociceptive fibers. Our data show a long-term sympathetic and sensory innervation change in the rat hind paw skin after the chronic constriction injury. This novel fiber arrangement after nerve lesion may play an important role in the development and persistence of sympathetically maintained neuropathic pain after partial nerve lesions.

Computer-assisted 3-D reconstructions were made of the three main 5-HT-ir neuron groups. The rostralmost brainstem group was located near the posterior commissure, the second group at the isthmus, and the third group in the bulbar area. For each of those groups, the distribution of the 5-HT-ir neurons was very similar in the three developmental stages examined, suggesting that the 5-HT system is relatively mature early in larval animals. The soma of 5-HT-ir neurons increased in size and their dendritic fields increased in complexity with development. Furthermore, the number of 5-HT-ir neurons in each group increased significantly from the larval to the reproductive stage. To determine whether this was due to the genesis of 5-HT neurons, bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) was injected into larval, metamorphosing, and postmetamorphic lampreys. These experiments revealed a few neurons colocalizing BrdU and 5-HT in metamorphosing animals. Taken together, the present results suggest that 5-HT neurons increase in number during maturation and that neurogenesis could, at least partially, contribute to the appearance of new 5-HT cells at different developmental stages.

The mechanism by which the receptor elicits these differential effects is poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that p75 is cleaved by gamma-secretase in sympathetic neurons, specifically in response to proapoptotic ligands. This cleavage resulted in ubiquitination and subsequent nuclear translocation of NRIF, a DNA binding protein essential for p75-mediated apoptosis. Inhibition of gamma-secretase or expression of a mutant p75 resistant to this protease prevented receptor proteolysis, blocked NRIF nuclear entry, and prevented apoptosis. In contrast, overexpression of the p75 ICD resulted in NRIF nuclear accumulation and apoptosis. The receptor proteolysis and NRIF nuclear localization were also observed in vivo during naturally occurring cell death in the superior cervical ganglia. These results indicate that p75-mediated apoptosis requires gamma-secretase dependent release of its ICD, which facilitates nuclear translocation of NRIF.

We now report that mammalian GCN2 is specifically activated in vitro upon binding of two nonadjacent regions of the Sindbis virus (SV) genomic RNA to its histidyl-tRNA synthetase-related domain. Moreover, endogenous GCN2 is activated in cells upon SV infection. Strikingly, fibroblasts derived from GCN2(-/-) mice possess an increased permissiveness to SV or vesicular stomatitis virus infection. We further show that mice lacking GCN2 are extremely susceptible to intranasal SV infection, demonstrating high virus titers in the brain compared to similarly infected control animals. The overexpression of wild-type GCN2, but not the catalytically inactive GCN2-K618R variant, in NIH 3T3 cells impaired the replication of a number of RNA viruses. We determined that GCN2 inhibits SV replication by blocking early viral translation of genomic SV RNA. These findings point to a hitherto unrecognized role of GCN2 as an early mediator in the cellular response to RNA viruses.

In the present study, MRI experiments showed that dopamine transporter blockers such as cocaine and dopamine releasers such as amphetamine and D1 receptor agonists induced large positive increases in relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) that were not sensitive to nitric oxide synthase inhibition. However, D1/D5 receptor antagonism with SCH-23390 prevented or blocked the hemodynamic response without any concomitant effect on dopamine release. Dopamine D2/D3 receptor agonists, in contrast, induced negative changes in rCBV in brain regions corresponding largely to those endowed with these receptors. D1 and D5 receptor mRNAs were expressed in microvessels of responsive brain areas, while D2 and D3 receptors were not consistently associated with the microvascular bed. D3 receptors had an astroglial localization. Together, these experiments show that direct effects of dopamine upon the vasculature cannot be ignored in measuring the hemodynamic coupling associated with dopaminergic drugs. These results further suggest that this coupling is partially mediated through D1/D5 receptors on the microvasculature leading to increased rCBV and through astroglial D3 receptors leading to decreased rCBV These data provide additional support for the role of local post-synaptic events in neurovascular coupling and emphasize that the interpretation of fMRI signals exclusively in terms of neuronal activity may be incomplete.

Twelve healthy volunteers performed bilateral finger apposition while attending to a radial yellow/blue checkerboard. Three levels of global CBF increase were achieved by inhaling 5, 7.5 or 10% CO2. CBF and BOLD signals were simultaneously quantified using interleaved multi-slice pulsed arterial spin labeling (PASL) and T-2*-weighted gradient echo sequences. Increasing basal CBF produced a significant decrease in the activation-induced BOLD response, with the slope of the optimal linear fit of activation versus basal BOLD signal changes of -0.32 +/- 0.01%/% for motor and visual cortex regions of interest (ROIs). While the modulation in basal flow level also produced a statistically significant effect on the activation-induced CBF change, the degree of relative attenuation of the flow response was slight, with a slope of -0.18 +/- 0.02%/%, in the motor and -0.13 +/- 0.01 %/% in the visual cortex ROI. The current findings describe a strong attenuation of the BOLD response at significantly, elevated basal flow levels and call for independent quantification of resting CBF in BOLD fMRI studies that involve subjects and/or conditions with markedly elevated global perfusion.

A State-Space Approach to Modelling Brain Dynamics to Appear in Statistica Sinica). Their approach assumed that the quantity representing the influence of one neuronal system over another, or effective connectivity, is time-invariant. However, more and more empirical evidence suggests that the connectivity between brain areas may be dynamic which calls for temporal modeling of effective connectivity. A Bayesian approach is proposed to solve this problem in this paper. Our approach first decomposes the observed time series into measurement error and the BOLD (blood oxygenation level-dependent) signals. To capture the complexities of the dynamic processes in the brain, region-specific activations are subsequently modeled, as a linear function of the BOLD signals history at other brain regions. The coefficients in these linear functions represent effective connectivity between the regions under consideration. They are further assumed to follow a random walk process so to characterize the dynamic nature of brain connectivity. We also consider the temporal dependence that may be present in the measurement errors. ML-11 method (Berger, J.O., 1985. Statistical Decision Theory and Bayesian Analysis (2nd ed.). Springer, New York) was employed to estimate the hyperparameters in the model and Bayes factor was used to compare among competing models. Statistical inference of the effective connectivity coefficients was based on their posterior distributions and the corresponding Bayesian credible regions (Carlin, B.P., Louis, T.A., 2000. Bayes and Empirical Bayes Methods for Data Analysis (2nd ed.). Chapman and Hall, Boca Raton). The proposed method was applied to a functional magnetic resonance imaging data set and results support the theory of attentional control network and demonstrate that this network is dynamic in nature.

In this study, we show that the Drosophila Semaphorin-1a (Sema1a), a transmembrane Semaphorin, is required cell autonomously in adult photoreceptor (R-cell) axons for the establishment of an appropriate topographic termination pattern in the optic lobe. Loss of sema1a disrupts the association of neighboring R-cell growth cones leading to defects in local termination pattern, whereas overexpression of sema1a induces the hyper-fasciculation of R-cell axons. The function of Sema1a in R-cell axon guidance absolutely requires its cytoplasmic domain. We propose that Sema1a functions as a receptor in regulating R-cell axon guidance in the Drosophila visual system.

Methods: A retrospective chart review was completed of children presenting with aseptic meningitis to eight Canadian pediatric hospitals over a two-year period. Results: There were 233 cases of proven enteroviral (EV) meningitis, 495 cases of clinical aseptic meningitis and 74 cases of possible aseptic meningitis with most cases occurring July to October. Headache, vomiting, meningismus and photophobia were more common in children >= 5 years of age, while rash, diarrhea and cough were more common in children < 5 years of age. Pleocytosis was absent in 22.3% of children < 30 days of age with proven EV meningitis. Enterovirus was isolated in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from 154 of 389 patients (39.6%) who had viral culture performed, and a nucleic acid amplification test for enterovirus was positive in CSF from 81 of 149 patients (54.3%). Imaging of the head by computerized tomography or magnetic resonance imaging was completed in 96 cases (19.7%) and 24 had abnormal findings that were possibly related to meningitis while none had changes that were definitely related to meningitis. There was minimal morbidity and there were no deaths. Conclusion: The clinical presentation of aseptic meningitis varies with the age of the child. Absence of CSF pleocytosis is common in infants < 30 days of age. Enterovirus is the predominant isolate, but no etiologic agent is identified in the majority of cases of aseptic meningitis in Canadian children.

However, how this structural change translates into the cognitive impairment observed in aged animals remains unknown. Aged animals are not a homogenous group with respect to their cognitive performances; but instead, they can be separated into aged cognitively unimpaired ("normal") and aged cognitively impaired groups using a spatial memory task such as the Morris water maze. These two aged groups provide an unprecedented opportunity to isolate synaptic properties that relate to cognitive impairment from unrelated factors associated with normal aging. Using such classification, we conducted whole-cell patch-clamp recordings to measure basal spontaneous miniature excitatory (mEPSCs) and inhibitory synaptic currents (mIPSCs) bombarding layer V pyramidal neurons in the parietal cortex. We found that the frequencies of both mEPSC and mIPSC were lower in aged normal rats when compared with young rats. In contrast, aged cognitively impaired rats displayed a reduction in mEPSC frequency only. This results in an imbalance towards inhibition that may be an important substrate of the cognitive impairment in aged animals. We also found that pyramidal neurons in both aged normal and aged cognitively impaired rats exhibit similar structural attritions. Thus, cognitive impairment may be more related to an altered balance between different neurotransmitter systems than a mere reduction in synaptic structures. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Using rigorous statistical filtering and machine-learning methods, the subcellular localization of 3274 of the 4768 proteins identified was determined with high confidence, including 1503 previously uncharacterized factors, while tissue selectivity was evaluated by comparison to previously reported mRNA expression patterns.

Here we identify an influence on the circadian oscillation of the clock protein PER2, endogenous changes in ovarian steroids, within two nuclei of the limbic forebrain: the oval nucleus of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and central nucleus of the amygdala. We show that the daily rhythm of PER2 expression within these nuclei but not in the suprachiasmatic nucleus, dentate gyrus, or basolateral amygdala is blunted in the metestrus and diestrus phases of the estrus cycle. The blunting of the PER2 rhythm at these phases of the cycle is abolished by ovariectomy and restored by phasic estrogen replacement suggesting that fluctuations in estrogen levels or their sequelae are necessary to produce these effects. The finding that fluctuations in ovarian hormones have area-specific effects on clock gene expression in the brain introduces a new level of organizational complexity in the control of circadian rhythms of behavior and physiology.

However, the information content of these perceptual moments remains a critical challenge to the understanding of consciousness. We uncovered this information content in four observers who consciously perceived each interpretation of the ambiguous Dali painting Slave Market with the Disappearing Bust of Voltaire. For each individual observer, we isolated the stimulus spatial frequency (SF) features underlying their overt judgments of the input as '' the nuns '' and '' Voltaire ''. Every 2 ms between stimulus onset and overt response, we derived the sensitivity of the observer's oscillatory brain activity (in the theta, alpha, and beta bandwidths) to these SF features. Then, in each bandwidth, we estimated the moments (between stimulus onset and perceptual judgment) when perception-specific SF features were maximally integrated, corresponding to perceptual moments. We show that the centroparietal beta oscillations support perceptual moments underlying the conscious perception of the nuns, whereas theta oscillations support the perception of Voltaire. For both perceptions, we reveal the specific information content of these perceptual moments.

Although the pathogenetic basis of this disorder is unclear, studies indicate this metal is highly accumulated in astrocytes, suggesting an involvement of these glial cells. To investigate this issue, we have used a recently characterized, sub-acute model of manganese neurotoxicity. Treatment of rats with manganese (11) chloride (50 mg/kg body weight, i.p.) once daily for I or 4 days led to increases in manganese levels of up to 232, 523. and 427% in the cerebral cortex, globus pallidus, and cerebellum, respectively, by instrumental neutron activation analysis. These changes were accompanied by development of pathological changes in glial morphology identified as Alzheimer type 11 astrocytosis in both cortical and sub-cortical structures. Co-treatment with either the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine or the manganese chelator 1,2-cyclohexylenedinitrilotetraacetic acid completely blocked this pathology, indicating the cellular transformation may be mediated by oxidative stress associated with the presence of this metal. These findings represent, to our knowledge, the first report of early induction of this pathological hallmark of manganese neurotoxicity, an event previously considered a consequence of chronic exposure to manganese in primates and in human cases of manganism. Our results also indicate that use of this rodent model may provide a novel opportunity to examine the nature and role of the Alzheimer type 11 astrocyte in the pathophysiology of this disorder as well as in other disease processes in which cerebral accumulation of manganese occurs.

This pattern is not explained solely by interaction with a vasoconstrictor pathway. To test involvement of the Rho-Rho kinase pathway in modulation of autoregulation by NO, the selective Rho kinase inhibitor Y-27632 and/or the NOS inhibitor N-omega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) were infused into the left renal artery of anesthetized rats. Y-27632 and L-NAME were also infused into isolated, perfused hydronephrotic kidneys to assess myogenic autoregulation over a wide range of perfusion pressure. In vivo, L-NAME reduced renal vascular conductance and augmented myogenic autoregulation, as shown by increased slope of gain reduction and associated phase peak in the pressure-flow transfer function. Y-27632 (10 mu mol/l) strongly dilated the renal vasculature and profoundly inhibited autoregulation in the absence or presence of L-NAME in vivo and in vitro. Afferent arteriolar constriction induced by 30 mmol/l KCl was reversed (-92 +/- 3%) by Y-27632. Phenylephrine caused strong renal vasoconstriction but did not affect autoregulation. Inhibition of neuronal NOS by N-5-(1-imino-3-butenyl)-L-ornithine(L-VNIO) did not cause significant vasoconstriction but did augment myogenic autoregulation. Thus vasoconstriction is neither necessary (L-VNIO) nor sufficient (phenylephrine) to explain the augmented myogenic autoregulation induced by L-NAME. The effect of L-VNIO implicates tubuloglomerular feedback (TGF) and neuronal NOS at the macula densa in regulation of the myogenic mechanism. This conclusion was confirmed by the demonstration that systemic furosemide removed the TGF signature from the pressure-flow transfer function and significantly inhibited myogenic autoregulation. In the presence of furosemide, augmentation of myogenic autoregulation by L-NAME was significantly reduced. These results provide a potential mechanism to explain interaction between myogenic and TGF-mediated autoregulation.
